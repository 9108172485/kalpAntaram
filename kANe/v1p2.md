Volume I, Part II Second Edition 
1975 
Printed and published by Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Honorary Secretary, 
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, at the 
Bhandarkar Institute Press, Poona, 
PREFACE 
The completion of the second revised and enlarged edition of Volume I of the History of Dharmaśāstra, marked by the publi cation of this its second part, gives us solace and a feeling of redemption. 
Soon after the release of the fifth and final Volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra in November 1962, Professor KANE began working on the revised edition of Volume I. Of course, it was not then visualised that the revision would ultimately result in the Volume becoming almost double its original size. But KANE was not a man to be satisfied with anything less than thorough and exhaustive. As his work of revision was progressing and growing in size, we thought that it would be advisable if the Volume was issued in two parts. The first part was, accordingly, published in May 1968 on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Institute. It was then hoped that the second part also would be published in the course of the next couple of years. 
But unfortunately that was not to be. What with the increa sing difficulties of printing and what with the sudden collapse in KANE's usually sound health, the publication of this second part had to wait - sadly enough - till the third death-anniversary of the author. It is to be particularly regretted that this part had to pass through press without Kane's imprimatur. 
We would like to reiterate, in all humility, that the Institute prides itself upon the kind of reflected glory which it enjoys on account of its close association with the History of Dharmaśāstra which has made a veritable history in the field of Indological studies and research.

.. pp. 6-11 
ATII 
According to Gautama, Apastamba, Vasiştha, Manu, Yājña valkya - principal sources were Veda, smrtis and custom - Vedas do not contain positive precepts on dharma, but give information incidentally-examples from Vedic literature suggesting dharmasa stra rules - division of ancient Sanskrit works into three groups, viz. the Vedic Sajjhitās, the Brahmanas and Sätras - Kalpa is one of the six angas of the Veda - Kalpa di ting'!ished by Tantravārtika from Kalpasutras.comprehensive pill thing of Kalpa - Kalpasūtras classi fied into three classes, viz. ? lutistras, Grhyasūras and Dharma sútras - brief review of Dr. Ram Gopal's large work on 'India of Vedic Kalp:sutras - mainly uzals !1 Gșh;a and Dharmasútras, that too, not critically or thoroughly.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Sec. 3 When Dharmaśāsira works were first composed .. pp.12–19 
It is difficult to say when composed - Nirkta (III. 4-5) exhi bits controversies about inheritance and quotes a verse (sloka) from some work on dharma - Bühler's view about such verses - Gau tama and Baudhāyana speak of dharmaśāstra - Baudhāyana and Apastamba mention numerous sages on dharmia - Vārtika of Katya yana and Jaimini speak of dharmaśāstra - Patañjali on dharmaşi trakāras- dharmaśāstra works existed prior to Yaska or at least before 600 B.C. and in 2nd century B. C. dharmasūtras had become authoritative-method of dealing with the whole dharmasastra litera ture followed in this book, first dharmasútras, then early metrical smstis like those of Manu ard Yājñavalkya, later versified smstis, then commentaries and digests, such as the Mităksarā - chronology of early writers very difficult to settle - Max Müller's view that works in continuous śloka metre followed sútra works not acceptable. 
Sec. 4 Dharmasūtras : 
.. pp. 19-22 Many of them formed part of the Kalpa and were studied in distinct sūtra-caranas - dharmasūtras of Āpastamba and Baudhà yana presuppose grhyasútras of thier carana - no dharmasútras ex tant corresponding to the śrauta and gshya sutras of Asvalāyana, Sankhāyana and Mänava-Tantravārtika on what dharmasútra was studied in what particular Vedic Sakhă-all dharmasūtras gradually became authoritative in all schools - close connection between grhyasūtras and dharmasutras on certain topics - scope of dharma sütras - gìhyasotras sometimes refer to dharmasütras - points of distinction between dharmasūtras and the other smstis.

Sec. 6 Baudhayana-dharmasutra : 
.. pp. 38-53 Baudhāyana is a teacher of the Black Yajurveda-arrangement of Baudhayana kalpa according to Dr. Burnell and Dr. Caland - Baudhāyanagrhya presupposes the Baudhāyanadharmasútra - gshya (I11.9.6) speaks of pravacan:kāra Kanva Bodhāyana and sūtrakāra A pastamba - tarpana in Baudhayana dharmasutra (II. 5. 27 ) men tions Kanva Bodhầyana, Apastamba and Hiranyakesin - contents of Baudhāyanadharmasötra - extant sūtra has not come down in tact-fourth praśna probably an interpolation - third praśna also not free from doubt - Baudhāyana III.10 taken from Gautama. Baudhà yana III. 6 agrees closely with Vişnudharmasutra 48 - Dr. Jolly thinks both borrowed from a conimon source - probably Visnu borrows from Baudhāyana - repetitions exist even in the first two praśnas - form and structure of Baudhāyana - quotes numerous verses, even in the first two praśnas - language of Baudhāyana often departs from Paninian standard - literature known to Baudhayana - several authors on dharma together with their views mentioned by Baudhāyana - Asura Kapila said to be originator of asramas-Sabara, Kumărila, Visvarūpa and Medhătithi refer to Baudhāyana dharma sútra - home of Baudhāyana - Baudhāyana is styled pravacanakāra and Apastamba sūtrakára - Bühler holds that Baudhayana was a southern teacher - sets out five peculiar usages of southern part - buotes several views about Āryåvarta - age of Baudhāyana dharma 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
sūtra - later than Gautama - Bühler's reasons for placing Baudha yana a century or two earlier than Apastamba not convincing-diver gences between Baudhāyana and Apastamba - style of Baudhā yana compared with that of Apastamba - Baudhāvana to be placed between 500-200 B. C.- numerous sūtras of Baudhayana identical with those of Apastamba and Vasiştha - Baudhavana mentions several appellations of Ganesa, just as Mänavagļhya does and mentions seven planets, Råhu and Ketu- Govindasvamin commen ted on Baudhayana. 
Sec. 7 Dharmasútra of Ăpastamba: 
.. pp. 53-90 
The Ăpastambakalpasūtra of the Black Yajurveda divided in to 30 prasnas, dharmasútra constituting 28th and 29th prasnas thereof - Ápastamba is one of the five subdivisions of the Khàndi keya school of Taittiriyaśākhả -Apastanibagļhya and dharma-sūtras are compositions of the same author-some sutras of the two are iden tical-Ap. gphya does not treat of some topics as they are dealt with in dharmasútra - though Dr. Ram Gopal points out ten sutras in Ap. Gr. about the choice of a marriageable girl there is only one rule worth something - there are several passages where Ap. Dh. S. presupposes Āp. Gr.-contents of Ap.dharmasútra-form and struc ture of Ap. dharmasūtra-Ap. is more archaic and un- Paninian th any other dharmasūtra-many unfamiliar words in Ap.-several verses quoted in Ap-literature known to Āp.- Ap. mentions six angas of Veda and ten writers on dharma by name-Svetaketu and Ap.-Hārita quoted frequently by Ap. - Ap. controverts several veiws-striking coincidences between Gautama and Ap. - Āp. quotes a verse from Purāna and speaks of the view of Bhavisyatpurāna - Apastamba and Manu - Apastamba presupposes many rules of the Mimāṁsā and agrees closely with Jaimini's sūtras-age of Ap. Dh. S. - quoted by Sabara, Kumärila, Saskarācārya, Viśvarüpa and Medhătithj - home and personal history of Apastamba not known - Dr. Ram Gopal's view about Ápastamba being earlier than Påụini who gives Apastamba's name in Bidădiga na, refuted - reply to Dr. Ram Gopal's puerile arg'iments about the home of Apastamba etc.-Áp. is later than Gautama and probably Baudhayana - Ap. Dh. S. may be assigned to the period of 450-350 B. C, not 600-300 B. C. ( as in the first edition)- Áp. condemns niyoga, rejects secondary sons, does not admit paišāca and Prājupatya forms of marriage - divergence 
Synopsis of Contents 
between the views of Ap. and Gautama and other sūtrakāras - Haradatta's is the only commentary extant on Ap.- Apastamba smrti in verse. 
Sec. 8 Hiranyakesidharmasutra : 
.. 91-94 
Hiranyakesidharmasūtra forms 26th and 27th praśnas of the Hiranyakešikalpa - Hiraṇyakesin's can be hardly called an indepen dent work, as it borrows hundreds of sūtras word for word from 
Ap.- a few additions made to Ap. in Hiranyakesi Dh.S. - Hiranya kesin's readings are smoother and more classical than Āpastamba's - arrangement of sūtras also is somewhat different in the two -com. of Mahadeva called Ujjvalā on Hyraṇyakešin is almost the same as Haradatta's on Āp. - Bühler thinks Mahadeva borrows from Haradatta - Mahadeva's com. in a few places contains more matter than Haradatta's and Mahadeva differs from Haradatta. 
FU 
Sec. 9 Vasistha-dharmasutra : 
.. pp. 94-112 Different editions of Vasistha contain different numbers of chapters - Kumārila says it was specially studied by Rgvedins - ex planation of this statement - nothing special in the Vasisthadharma sútra to connect it with Rgveda - contents of the Vasişthadharma sūtra - style of Vas. Dh. S. resembles Gautama's - many sütras of Vas, identical with Gautama and Baudhāyana - form of Vasistha dharmasūtra resembles Baudhāyaradharmasūtra - Medhătithi and Mitakşarà quote from almost all chapters of extant Vasistha and so does Viśvarūpa - literature known to Vasiştha-Vasiştha prohibits learning language of Mlecchas - authors on dharmaśātsra named by Vasiştha - Vasistha's references to the views of Manu are made with reference to a work of Manu almost identical with the present Manu smộti and do not compel us to forniluate the existence of a Māna vadharmasutra - Bühler wrong in taking Vas. Dh. S. 4.8 as a quo tation from Mänavadharmasútra-only Vas. Dh. S. 12.16 and 19.37 where Manu is quoted have no corresponding verses in the present Manusmrti - over forty verses are entirely common to Vas. and present Manusmīti - conclusion that Vas. contains borrowings from the present Manusmộti or its prototype in verse - Vas. Dh. S. 22 is the same as Gautama 19 - Dr. Jolly's view that Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 are borrowed from Vişnudharmasútra chap. 56 and 87 or its original the Kathakadharmasutra is wrong - home of Vas, to 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
the north of Narmadā, according to Bühler - this is mere specula tion - earliest reference to Vasiştha as a writer on dharma is in Manu (8.140 ) - age of Vasiştha - Vasiştha's views are ancient, praticularly about secondary sons, about Dattaka son, about niyoga and remarriage - he mentions only six forms of marriage - but in other matters differs from Gaut. or Baudh. viz, on adoption, on documents - Vas. Dh. S. between 303–100 B. C.- whether Vas. 18.4 ( Rāmaka v. 1. Romaka ) contains a reference to the Romans - the author of the extant Vas. Dh. S. appears to be eclectic and the extant Vas. Dh. S. is only a re-hash of the Ap. Dh. S., Baud. Dh. S. and Manu - passages from the Samhitas and Brahmanas quoted in or referred to by Vas. Dlı. S. outnumber the Rgvedic passages - this shows that Vas. Dh. S. did not at first attach itself to the Rgveda - Dr. Ram Gopal's remarks on the passages of Vas, and the three Gț. sútras attached to Rgveda are misleading - Viddha-Vasi ștha, an early compilation - there is a Bệhad Vasiştha and a Jyotir Vasistha - Yajñasvāmin commented upon Vas. Dh. S. 
Sec. 10 Visnudharmasutra : 
... 112-127 
Visņu Dh. S. contains 100 chapters and yet sutra not extensive - several chap. (40, 42, 76 ) contain only one sutra and one verse - first chap. and the last two are entirely in verse, the rest in mixed prose and verse - Vişnu Dh. S. closely connectej with Kathasākha - Dr. Jolly says chap. 21, 67, 73 and 86 of Vișnu closely correspond with Kathaka gshya - but Vişnu Dh. S. is not the work of the author of Kathaka grhya - contents of Visnu Dh. S. - Vişnu resembles Vas. Dh. S. - its peculiar feature that it professes to be re vealed by God Vişnu - its style, easy and diffuse - work contains old and new material - hundreds of sůtras are prose renderings of hund reds of verses occurring in our Manu - hypothesis of a common origin or borrowing by both from a floating mass of verses unten able - extant Vişnudharmasutra borrows from Manu-Vispu contains verses identical with the Bhagavadgită and Yājñavalkya smrti - Dr. Jolly's view that Yäjñavalkya borrows his anatomical section from Vişnu not correct - Vispu Dh. S. contains long list of tirthas, the word Jaiva for Jupiter - those wanting in Yājñavalkya - extant Vişnu Dh. S. later than Manusmịti and Yajñavalkyasmsti - Viśva rūpa does not quote a single sutra of Visņu by name, though he refers to Vişnu (ch. 97) for orders of samnyasins - Mitàksarā 
Synopsis of Contents 
quotes hardly any verse from Visnu - Aparárka and Smsticandrika quote Vişnu profusely - verses were added at a late date to original sūtra - literature known to Vişnu Dh.S. -Vişnu mentions the seven days of the week, recommends the practice of saii, speaks of pus takas, of many good and evil omens among which the sight of yellow-robed Buddhist ascetics is included - it prohibits speech with Mlecchas and journeys to Mlcccha countries, it dilates on worship of Vasudeva - though Vişnu agrees in some respects with Kathaka grhya, on some points it differs from it- date of older kernel of Vişnu may be 300 to 10j B.C. - additions made after 3rd century A. D. and before 7th century - some sūtras agree closely with Nārada - Bșhad Vişnu and Vrddha Vişnu and Laghu Vişnu - Nanda pandita's com. on the Vişnu Dh. S. - probably Bhāruci also com mented on it. 
Sec. 11 The Dharmasūtra of Harita : 
... pp. 127-136 
Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vasistha quote Hārīta as an authority - Mr. Islampurkar secured a ms. of Harītadharmasútra at Nasik in 30 chapters - contents of that ms. - its relation to Maitra yaniyasashitā - it mentions the Kaśmirian word “Kaphella" - two-fold classification of śruti and its explanation - quotations in commentaries and digests show that Harita dealt exhaustively with the same topics that are found in other dharmasútras - Kumärila mentions Hårita as dharmaśāstrakāra but does not assign him to any particular caraña as he does Āpastamba and others - notable doctrines of Harita - mentions worship of Ganesa - Harita's verses on vyavahåra quoted in nibandhas are later than the sūtra - quoted by Aprārka, Kalpataru, Brahmacarikanda, Sm. C. - Laghu Hårita and Viddha Hårita - latter in verse is later than Yajñavalkya, Nārada and Katyayana. 
Sec. 12 The Dharmasútra of Sunkha-Likhita : 
... pp. 136-142 
From Tantravārtika it appears that dharmasútra of Sankha Likhita was studied by Vājasaneyins - Mahabharata (Śànti 23 contains story of brothers Sankha and Likhita - Pali story in Dighanikāya seems to be based on the story in the Mahabharata - various compilations ascribed to Sankha alone or Likhita alone or to both - restoration of Dharmasútra in the Annals of Bhandarkar

Institute (vols. VII, VIH ) - Verse Sarkhasmsti stricter than prose Sankha-Likhita - com. on dharmasútra mentioned in Kalpataru and Vivādaratnākara - doctrines of dharmasūtra similar to those of other dharmasútras - speaks of twelve secondary sons - allows niyoga - speaks of several ordcals - defines Aryavarta as between Sindhu-Sauvira and Kampilya - literature known to Sankha - Likhita - probable age between 300 B.C. - 100 A.

Sec. 13 Mänavadharmasútra : Did it exist ? 
... pp. 143-149 
Max Müller and Weber responsible for the theory that the extant Manusmệti was a recast of an ancient Mānavadharmasútra now lost - hardly any data for the sweeping generalisation of Max Müller that all genuine dharmaśāstras are nothing but more modern texts of earlier sūtra works on kuladharma - one main plank of this theory that the continuous en ployment of the sloka metre was un known in the sutra period is now exploded - Bühler supports Max Müller's theory by some additional arguments - Vasiştha IV. 5-8 on which Bühler relies not properly understood by him - Vasistha ( 19-37) quotes a Mänava sloka which is not in the Anuştubh metre and not found in extant Manu and Bühler thinks it is taken from Mänavadharmasútra · Bühler's reliance on a fragment of Ušanas which is corrupt is not worth consideration - Bühler relies on Kamandakiyanitisára ( II. 3 and XI. 67) where Mānavas are said to hold that there are three vidyās for a king and that Manu said that king's council should consist of 12 ministers - These views not the same in extant Manu - Bühler's conclusion not correct - Kamandaka is only paraphrasing Kautiliya-Bühler's generalisation about Mānava or Manavāh without foundation - Kumarila, Sankara and Visvarūpa all employ · Mänava 'for Manusmộti - Bühler relies on analogy of the complete set of Apastamba and Raudhayana sūtras for holding that a Månavadharmasūtra existed - Proper explanation of Vas. Dh. S. IV. 5-8 - Bühler not right in saying that Vas. Dh. S. 11. 23, 12, 16, 23.43 either contradict Manu or find no counterpart therein - analogy of Apastamba sūtras of no use. excepting the three caranas of the Black Yajurveda, no carana of any Veda has a dharmasūtra attributed to the founder of that carapa - an explanation suggested - existing materials not sufficient to establish theory that a Münavadharmasūtra once existed.

The three words used in the same sense viz. Arthasāstra, Dandaniti and Rajasāstra or Rajaniti or Rajanitiśāstra or Nitiśāstra meaning and scope of arthasastra and relation to dharmaśātra - arthaśāstra, an upaveda of Atharvaveda - Mr. Kavi wrongly holds that Kautilya borrows from the Cakşusiya Arthaśāstra - the Artha śāstra of Kautilya, first translated by Dr. Shama Šāstri and text published in 1909 - Other editions - numerous works and articles inspired by the publication of Kautiliya Arthaśāstra - Kauţiliya is the oldest extant work on Arthasāstra - purpose of this sāstra. rule in case of conflict between Dharmaśāstra and Arthasāstra - thinking on politics, economics, law etc. prevailed in India several centuries before Christ as is clear from the Mbh., and early Dharma sütras of Gautama, Baudhayana and Apastamba - Arthaśāstra of Brhaspati - principles, and phraseology of Arthaśāstra in the Mbh. and the Rāmāyaṇa - Canakya and Vişnugupta are names of the same person - glowing tribute paid to Canakya or Visnugupta by Kamandakiyanitisăra, Tantrākhyāyika, Dandin - Bana and Pañca tantra on Kautilya as author of Arthasastra - Bịhatkathă of Gunādhya contained his story - Mudrárákşasa connects his name with Kutila - these works along with the Kathasaritsàgara, Kávyàdarsa etc, naming Visņugupta, Cànakya and Kautilya singly or collectively, dealt with - Puranas mentioning Cadragupta and his minister Kautilya - Candragupta and Seleucus - Bàņa refers to Kautilya's work as a cruel work and so also does the Matsya Purana - the extant Arthaśāstra itself claims that it is a work of Kautilya - Candragupta and the epithet Vršala used for him - Vişnugupta, an astrologer mentioned by Varàhamihira must be entirely different from the author of the Arthaśāstra - controversy as to whether Kauțiliya can be the work of a busy minister of Candragupta Maurya - Jolly, Winternitz and Keith hold that extant work is not by the minister of Candragupta - Megasthenes. silence about Cāņakya explained - whether the Kautiliya is the product of a school or of an individual author - Kautilya's views cited about 70 times in the work in the third person - explanation of this - Dr. Jolly wrong in his explanation of apadeša ( in XV. 1). - Keith thinks that an author would not parade an uncompliment ary epithet like Kautilya ( derived from kutila) - Is the name Kautilya or Kautalya - works on gotra and pravara give various

forms such as Kautali, Kautilya and Kauțili - form, style and con tents of the Kauţiliya - a few verses interspersed in the work, generally at the end - in all 375 verses excluding mantras - some verses are certainly quotations - work abounds in numerous techni cal and rare words - deviations from Påņini – summary of contents - section on judicial administration interesting - greatest correspon dence between Kautiliya and Yájñavalkya - some striking examples - it is Yajñavalkya that borrows - reasons - Yājñavalkya represents a far too advanced stage o juristic priniciples than Kautilya - close agreement between Manusmrti and Kautilya also - but they differ on niyoga, as to nomenclature of vyavahārapadas, about heirship of mother and paternal grandmother, on remarriage of widows, divorce, gambling - Kautiliya long anterior to the extant Manu smộti - Kautilya's five references to Mànavas explained - references to Svayambhuva and Prācetasa Manu contained in the Maha bhārata suggest that there were two works in verse on dharma and politics attributed to these or perhaps one work containing both, subsequently recast as the extant Manusmộti - only two views ascribed to Månavas in Kauţiliya not found in extant Manusmộti - in the dharmasthiya section the only other authors or schools cited are Bărhaspatyas and Aušanasas - none of the dharmasútras of Gautama and others are anywhere quoted by name - views cited on the question as to whom a child belongs (to the begetter or to him on whose wife it is begotten ) can be traced to Baudhāyana, Gautama and Vasistha - views of Acāryas cited in the Kautiliya - Kauțiliya later than Gautama and Apastamba but earlier than extant Manusmộti - date of Kauţiliya - it is certainly not later than 2nd century A. D. and not earlier than 325 B.C. - schools named by Kautilya and also individual authors - views of Acāryas are quoted over fifty times and Kautilya differs in each case - meaning of 'ācāryas' - literature known to Kautilya - Sanskrit official lang. uage and the work mentions gunas of composition - Kautiliya agrees with Kamasutra in several respects - Dr. Jolly and Prof. Keith opine that both works composed about same time-points of difference between the two works - countries and peoples men tioned by Kautilya - silks from Cina and blankets from Nepal - home of Kautilya, southern acc. to Dr. Jolly who concludes so. on two quite worthless grounds - Buddhist and Jain traditions associate Cảnakya with Gándhūra - was resident of the extreme North-west of India - three principal groups of writers on the question of the

C.- age of Manusmrit - external evidence - Medhatithi's is the first extant commentary - Visvarüpa quotcs 200 verses - Sankara. Kumārila and Sabara refer to Manu - Bșhaspati had the present text of Manu before him - Asvaghosa in his Vajrasuci quotes several verses from Mänavadharma' some of which are found in our Manu - Rāmāyana ( Kişkidhà 18. 30-32 ) contains Manu VIII. 318 and 316 - Maou attained present form long before 2nd century A. D.-there are earlier and later strata in Manu -contra dictory statements as to Brahmana marrying a sūdra woman, about appropriate forms of marriage, about niyoga, about flesh eating - Bühler's conclusion is that cosmological and philosophi cal portions in 1st and 12th books, rules about mixed castes and duties of castes in 10th book are later additions - all additions made before 3rd century A. D.-Manusmộti has not suffered several recasts - quotations cited as Viddha Manu and Bệhan-Manu are later than Manusmrti - extant Manu older than Yājñavalkya - Manu mentions Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and Cinas - extant Manusmộti composed between 2nd century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. - relation of Mahābhārata and Manu - conflict of views between Mandlik, Hopkins and Bühler - Hopkins holds that there was a mass of floating verses ascribed to mythical Manu on which both Manusmrti and Mahabharata drew – Bühler says that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to Manu - Manu mentions stories and names that occur in the Mahābhārata but these names go into Vedic antiquities - Manu never names the Mahābhārata, while the latter often refers to'rājadharmas or śästra of Manu' or to what Manu said ' - Jayaswal's remarks on Manu XII. 100 are worthless for settling the date of the Manu smrti – both Hopkins and Bühler hold that the Anušāsanaparva and Säntiparva knew a Manusmrti, but earlier books, when ever they speak of Manu, refer to floating mass of popular verses - this conclusion not correct - final conclusion, viz., long before 4th

C, and 200 A. D.

Sec. 32 The Two Epics 
... pp. 349-408 
The two great Epics contain numerous passages bearing on topics of Dharmasastra - Mbh. itself claims as being composed by Vyāsa as a great Dharmaśāstra, as Arthasāstra etc. - Mbh. consists of one hundred thousand verses – a great deal has been written about the Two Epics - a work for popular education long before the 7th cent. A. D. - Ånuvamsa Slokas in Mbh. - From the references in Papipi and Patañjali it is certain that the story of Mbh. is diffe rent from the story of Rāmāyaṇa - there was considerable scope for adding stories and didactic matter and hence the Mbh. became very much inflated by additions at different times - literature known to Mbh. - criticism against four passages relied upon by Hopkins as referring to Rāmāyaṇa – the core of the Mbh. existed before 500 B. C.-references to Mbh. in some early inscriptions - Nilakantha's commentary on Mbh. -- date of the Mahābhārata war – both the Epics inspired many later writers to compose Sanskrit dramas on the characters and stories contained in them - the Mahābhārata, predominantly a Vaişžavite work. 
Several recensions of the Rāmāyaṇa -- the three well-known being Southern, Bengali and North-Western - relation to the Dasarathajātaka – references to the legends in the Mabābhārata occur in the extant Rāmāyaṇa - Rāmāyaṇa mainly being a Kāvya is less quoted than the Mahābhārata, but is relied upon as a source of dharma - the Rāmāyana exists in Bali in the Kavi language

D. - total number of verses on vyavahăra in the Agnipurāna is 315, out of which the first 31 are not taken from Yājñavalkya - almost all of these 31 taken from Nārada - Garudapurăņa (chap. 93) expressly says that the dharma

65. Dhāreśvara Bhojadeva 
585 
65. Dhāresvara Bhojadeva The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 135) says that Dhāreśvara tries to re concile the conflicting texts about the right of the widow to succeed to her husband's estate by saying that she succeeded if her husband was separate and if she was willing to submit to niyoga. On the same verse the Mit. says that following Mānu IX. 217 Dhāreśvara placed the paternal grand-mother immediately after the mother as an heir and even before the father. On Yāj. III. 24 the Mit says that certain texts of Rsyaśặnga about impurity on death were not accepted as authoritative by Dhāreśvara, Viśvarūpa and Medbātithi. Vide sec. 60 Viśvarūpa about the remarks of the Smộticandrikā on Dhāreśvara and Visvarūpa. The Hāralațā777 (p. 117) remarks (as does the Mit. on Yaj. III. 24 ) that Bhojadeva, Viśvarūpa, Govindarāja, and the Kāmadhepu did not cite certain texts as Jātukarna's and that therefore they were not authoritative. 
That Dhāreśvara is to be identified with Bhojadeva of Dhārā, perhaps the most famous Indian prince as a patron of learned men, follows from several considerations. The Dāya bhāga778 cites Bhojadeva and Dhāreśvara without making any distinction between the two. Some views that are ascribed to Dhāreśvara in one work are ascribed to Bhojadeva in another. The Vivadatāndava of Kamalākara ascribes to Bhoja deva the same views as to the widow's rights as are ascribed to Dhäreśvara by the Mit. Mss. of the Rājamārtanda (com mentary on the Yogasutras ) have colophons saying that the work was composed by Dhāreśvara Bhojarāja. Dhāreśvara is styled ācārya by the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 24 ) and sūri by the Smộticandrikā ( II p. 257 ).' Works on numerous branches of knowledge were composed by (or in the name of or under ) Bhoja of Dhārā. On Poetics we have two extensive works of his, viz. the Sarasvatikanthabharana and the Sțngāraprakāśa.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
A verse at the779 beginning of the Rājamārtanda tells us that Bhoja composed a work on grammar, a commentary on the Yogasūtra and a work on medicine called Rājamsgānka just as Patañjali wrote on these three subjects ( vide Mitra's Notices of Mss, vol. I, p. 115 for the medical work of Bhoja called Rājamārtanda (alias Yoga sāra ). He composed a work on astronomy called Rājamrgānka. A work of his on the Saiva āgama called Tattvaprakāśa has been published in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. There are several other works ascribed to him, which need not be set out here. That he composed an extensive work on the principal subjects of Dharmaśāstra follows from the numerous references to him contained in the Mit., the Dāyabhāga, the Hāralaţā and other works. The Suddhi-kaumudī780 (B. I. edition) of Govindānanda frequently speaks of a work called Rāja mărtanda of Bhoja on Srāddha. The Jayasimha-kalpadruma (p. 26 ) quotes Rājamārtanda and Bhojarājiya on the same page. Whether Bhoja composed on Dharmaśāstra one work or two (as he composed two on Poetics ), and whether his work was a commentary or an independent digest it is difficult to say. M.M. Haraprasādaśāstri in one of his reports threw out the suggestion that the Kāmadbenu was the work of Bhoja, but this is entirely worng, as the words of Sridatta in his Pitsbhakti781 will show. 
Besides the two points noted above ( about widow's 
ts and about the grandmother, there are others on which the Mit. and Dhåreśvara disagreed : viz. Dhāreśvara held

ownership to be known only from śāstra, while the Mit, held it to be laukika (vide Viramitrodaya pp. 528, 536 ). Dhāreśvara held that the word 'dubitaraḥ' in Yāj. stands for putrikā in the order of succession (Smrticandrika II. pp. 295-96). On other points the views of Dhāreśvara coincide with those of the Mit., viz, on the usage of giving a special share to the eldest son having fallen into desuetude, on the daughter's son's right to succession, on the father's inability to give a greater or smaller share to his sons in ancestral property on & partition during his life-time. Vide my article on Bhojadeva in JBBRAS for 1925, pp. 223-224 for details of these and other views ascribed to Bhojadeva. A few other references may be noted here. The Nirnayamrtars (p. 68) quotes a Bhojarajiya text. In the Kālaviveka of Jimūta vāhana two verses about taking food at the time of eclipses are cited from Bhojadeva (p. 539 ). In several works certain views are stated to be those of a Bhūpāla paduhati or of Bhūpāla or of Rāja. The reference seems to be to a work of king Bhoja. For example, in the Dānaratnākara, a Bhūpāla-paddhati and Bhūpāla are frequently quoted.83 The Samayapradipa784 and Acārādarsa of Sridatta speak of both Bhūpāla and Rāja. In other works also the views of Bhoja are often referred to as those of Rāja (the king par excellence ). For example, the Ekāvali785 ( a

work on Poetics ) says that in the Sșngāra--prakāśa, the king accepted only one rasa. Dr. Raghavan has recently published (in 1963 ) a complete and learned exposition of the Syngāra prakāśa of Bhoja ( 1009 pages ). The Varsakaumudi ( p. 107 ) says that a certain verse is cited by the Gangāvākyāvalī without naming the author, but as it is not cited by the Rājā and the rest, it is unauthoritative. 
The several tattvas of Raghunandana mention two works of Bhojadera or Bhojarāja. For example, the Tithitattva (Jivananda vol. I, p. 17 ) cites a text as quoted in the Bhuja balabhima by Bhojarāja ; similarly, in the Srăddhatattva (Jivananda vol. I, p. 266 ) two texts are cited as quoted by Bhojadeva in Bhujabalabhima. Raghunandana also mentions Rājamārtanda of Bhojarāja ( vide Āhnikatattva, vol. I, p. 451 ) He often cites the Rājamārtanda and the Bhujabalabhima on the same page without the author's name (e.g. vide Udvāha tattva, vol. II, p. 124 ). Raghunandana often speaks of a Brhad-Rājamārtanda along with the Rājamārtanda on the same or the next page ( vide Tithitattva, vol. I. pp. 25-26 and Jyotistattva pp. 605 and 655 ). That the Bhujabalabhima and the Rājamārtanda are two different works appears to be clear. Whether the Bộbad-Rājamārtanda and the Raja mārtanda are distinct works is not quite clear. (Vide Tri. Cat. of Madras Govt. mss. for 1919-22, p. 4562, No. 3079 for Bhujabalanibandha of Bhojarāja in 18 adhyāyas on astrological matters in relation to dharmaśāstra such as strijāta ka, karņādivedha, vrata, vivāhamelakadaśaka, grhakarmapraveśa, samkrāntisnāna, dvadaśamāsakrtya ). The Bhujabalabhima is also mentioned by Sūlapāņi and by Rudradhara in bis Srāddhaviveka. 
Vide the present author's paper on, ‘King Bhoja and his Works on Dharmaśāstra and Astrology in J. O. R. ( Madras ), Vol. XXIII pp. 94-127, where five works of Bhoja are named. Vide also a paper on 'Passages from the Rājamārtanda on "Tithis, Vratas and Utsavas' by the present author in ABORI Vol. XXXVI ( Parts III and IV ) pp. 306-339 ( 286 verses out of 1462 on the basis of three Mss. ), Dr. Derrett, in Bulletin of L. S. O. A. S. Vol. XV ( part 3) pp. 598-602, draws attention to the commentary Durghațārtha-prakāśini of Vimalabodha on Mahābhārata, Santi, and Chap. 121, 14ff, where the commentator mentions Bhojadeva's interpretation

of those verses in the latter's work called Vyavahāra-mañjarī. Vide Dr. Gode's paper in the Silver Jubilee number of B, O. R. I. pp. 146ff. about a ms, of this com. in the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute of Poona. 
For two works of Bhoja on Sanskrit Poetics called 'Sarasvatikanthabharana' and the Srngāraprakāśa', vide the present author's History of Sanskrit Poetics' pp. 257-264 ( ed. of 1961 ) and for the Srngāraprakāśa, Dr. Raghavan's monumental work on it ( containing over a thousand pages) published very recently (1963 ) which contains a full exposi tion of Bhoja's great work, 
Bhoja of Dhārā, according to the Bhojaprabandha, had a long reign of 55 years. Bhoja's was a remarkable career. In spite of the fact that he was constantly waging wars with different kings, he became the most famous Indian King as the patron of learned inen. Considering the fact that he ruled long ( about 50 years or so ) and was generous to learned men the inscriptional references to him are rather few. There are only six records (of which five are copperplates ) contempo rary in time with him. They are: (1) The Ujjain plate in 1. A. vol. VI p. 53 of Samvat 1078, Māgha dark half, 3rd tithi Sunday ( 1021 A. D. ). It gives the pedigree as follows. Sīyakadeva-Vākpatirāja - brother Sindhurāja or Sindhula-son Bhojadeva. The grant was issued from the capital Dhārā; (2) the Banswara plate of Bhoja ( E. I, Vol. XI p. 181-133 ), dated Samvat 1076, Mágha bright half ( 23rd January 1020 A. D. ) issued on the festival for the conquest of Konkaņa (Konkaņa vijayaparvani); (3) the Betma plate ( in E. I. Vol. 18 pp. 320-325 issued in Samvat 1076, Bhādrapada bright half, 15 (September 1020 A. D.) on Konkaņa-grahana = vijayaparvaņi); ( 4 ) the Tilakvādā plate (in Proceedings of the First Oriental Conference, 1919, pp. 319-326 of Samvat 1103, Märgaśīrsa, 1046 A, D. ; ( 5 ) the Kalvan plate ( E. I. XIX p. 69 ) refers to conquest of Konkana by Bhoja and sets out a private person's grant of certain pieces of land to the temple of Munisuvrata on Caitra amāvāsyii ( when there was a solar eclipse ); (6) Inscripation on the pedestal of an image of Sarasvati made in Samvat 1091 i. e. 1035 A. D. ( which found its way to the British Museum ) and it records that Bhoja caused the image of Vāgdevī to be prepared by a sculptor. In 'Rūpam' (edited by 0. C. Gangoly ) for January 1924 the image of

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Sarasvati is reproduced as the frontispiece and pp. 1-2 give some details and a slightly mutilated verse (in Sārdūla vikridita metre ) is set out with translation by Mr. Dikshit and the date samvat 1091 also is inscribed on the pedestal. In E. I. Vol. VIII p. 96 there is an inscription of Arjuna varmadeva, a descendant of Bhoja where it is stated that the drama Pārijāta mañjarī was first performed in the hall of Săradādevī built by Bhoja. Dr. Raghavan's latest work on Bhoja's Śộngāraprakāśa, 1963, has a fine reproduction of this image as a frontispiece. 
In the Navagībasănkacarita of Padmagupta alias Pari mala, Vāk patirāja is mentioned in XI. 81, Sindhurăja in XI. 101 and in XI. 102 it is said that in the assemblies of warriors he is mentioned as Navasāhasāňka ( Viragosthīşu giyate) and in XVIII. 62 his coming to Dhårå is mentioned. But all this does not state how many years he ruled. He must, however, have ruled for some years in order to be called Navasāhasänka for his valour. Vākpatirăja was also called Muñja, wbo was slain by Câlukya king Tailapа between 994-997 A. D. There fore, Bhoja, son of Sindhurāja, may be held to have begun to rule about 1005 A. D. The Māndhātā plate of Jayasimha, successor of Bhoja ( issued from Dhårā ), is dated in sorvat 1112 ( Asādha, dark balf i. e. 1055 A. D. ); Vide E. I. Vol. III pp. 46-50 ( gives the names as Vākpatirāja-Sindhurāja Bhojadeva-Jayasimha ). Therefore, Bhoja must have ruled from about 1005 A. D. to about 1054 A. D.786 
The stories ( in Prabandhacintāmaņi ) about Muõja's trying to do away with Bhoja must be treated as legendary trash. Tawney's translation of Prabandhacintamani (p. 32 ) refers to a prophecy made on the horoscope of Bhoja that he would rule for fiftyfive years, seven months and three days. 
There is further definite data. The Rājamrgānka of Bboja ( an astronomical work ) takes saka 964 (1042-43 A. D.) as its initial date. 787

It is strange that the Madanaratnapradípa (on Vyava hāra p. 324 ) refers to Bhoja as Dhāreśvarabhatta. 
There is a work oamed Dharma-pradipa by Bhoja (Govt. Mss. Lib. at the B. O. R. I. Poona, No. 26 of 1874-75). It is a work by another Bhoja later than 1400 A. D., as it quotes Vijñāneśvara and the Madanapārijāta. It was composed by an assembly of pandits at the bidding of king Bhoja of Āsāpura, son of Bhāramalla. The ms. was copied in sanvat 1695 (i. e. 1638-39 A. D.). 
66. Devasyamin The Smộticandrikā tells us that Devasvā min composed like Srīkara and Sambhu a work in the nature of a digest of smrtis (smrtisamuccaya ). Vide note 748 above. The com mentary of Nārāyana of the Naidhruva gotra, son of Divākara, on the Asvalāyanagrhyasūtra788 says that it relies upon the bhāsya of Devasvāmin on the same work Gárgya Nārāyana, son of Narasimha, in bis commentary on the Asvalāyana srautasūtra, tells us that he follows the bhāsya of Devasvāmin thereon. It is hardly likely that two writers of the same name flourished about the same time. Hence it may be assumed that Devasvāmin wrote bhāsyas on the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gșhya sūtras and a digest of smộtis, where he discussed all topics of dharma, such as ācāra, vyavahăra, āśauca &c. The commentary of Bhattoji789 on the Caturviņsati mata refers to the view of Devasvāmin on sraddha and āśauca. Hemādri780 ( vol. III, part 2, p. 324 ) and Madhava (on Parāśara, vol. I, part 2, p. 328 ) also quote Devasyāmin. The Smộticandrikā quotes the views of Devasvāmin on vyavahāra

and aśauca several times. For example, Devasvāmin791 ex plained the woru Yautaka differently from the Nigbantu ( which explained it as the wealth that was given to a woman when she was seated on the same seat with her husband at the time of marriage ). Devasvāmin explained that the word of the Samgraha792 that, when a son was born to one of several full brothers, he stood as a son to all and that the same rule applied to several co-wives when one of them had a son, meant that in both cases another son should not be adopted. Devasvāmin held the view ( like Bhojadeva ) that the word 'duhitr'in Yājñavalkya's verses on succession meant putrika.793 Devasvāmin explained Manu794 9. 141 ag saying that the adopted son ( in the particular case mentioned by Manu ) took all the wealth and the gotra of his adoptive father. Vide Smrticandrika ( Mysore ed.) on asauca p. 22. The Vaijayantī of Nandapandita (on Visņu 22. 32 ) quotes the view of Devasvāmin that on the death of unmarried daughters mourning was to be observed for ten days.195 The

( II, p. 289 ) says 'तस्य पूर्वोक्तेन सहाविरोधाय देवखामिना तात्पर्यार्थ उक्तः उभयत्र नान्यः प्रतिनिधिः कार्य इति ग्रन्थेन'. The same words occur in the स. वि.

Smrticandrikā quotes a verse from Devasvămin796 on śrăddha also. 
In the Prapancahrdaya ( Tri. S. series, p. 39 ) we are told that Devasvāmin composed a brief gloss on the 12 adhyāyas of the Pūrvamīmāṁsāsūtra and the four adhyāyas of the Samkarsakānda, seeing that the bhāsyas of Bodhāyana and Upavarsa were vast. The Govt. collection of Mss. at Madras has Devasvāmin's bhâsya on the Samkarsakānda ( vide Tri. Cat. vol. III, part I, Sanskrit C, p. 3841). There are not sufficient data available to establish the identity of this writer with Devasvāmin, the writer on dharmaśāstra. 
As the Smsticandrikā quotes Devas vāmin so profusely, he cannot be later than 1150 A. D. His earlier limit can be determined in several ways. Gārgya Nārāyana's comment on Āśvalāyanaśrauta (II. 1. 14 ) is quoted by Trikāndamandapa, who is himself (quoted by Hemādri. Therefore Gárgya Nārāyana could not have flourished later than 1100 A.D. ( vide Bhandarkar’s Report on search for mss., 1883-84, pp. 30-31 ). Therefore Devasvāmin probably flourished about 1000-1050 A. D., if not earlier. The fact that Devasvamin held certain views similar to Bhojadeva's also corroborates the chronological position thus assigned to him. 
67. Jitendriya Jitendriya is one of those writers who at one time held an eminent position but in course of time sank into unmerited oblivion. The works of Jimūtavāhana bear abundant testi mony to the fact that Jitendriya wrote an extensive work on dharmaśāstra. In his Kālaviveka (p. 380 ) Jimūta vāhana says that Jitendriya797 wrote on the topic of kāla (i. e. on determining doubtful points about the months, the tithis, samkrāntis, &c, and the religious rites to be performed on them ). In several passages of the Kālaviveka the very words of Jitendriya are quoted. Jitendriya said that a rite that occupies in performance only a short time must be per

formed at the principal time indicated for it798 ( and not at a gauna time ). From another quotation it appears that Jitendriya controverted the views of a predecessor Sambhra mabhatta.799 Jitendriya is said to have enumerated the names of the fifteen muhūrtus of the day from the Matsyapurăņa ; 800 vide pp. 257, 367 of the Kalaviveka for other places where the views of Jitendriya on kāla occur. In the Dāyabhāga of Jimūtavāhana also Jitendriya is frequently mentioned. The Dāyabhāga says that, if a man takes another's gold believing it to be iron or takes what is another's believing ( in good faith) that it is his own, Jitendriya held in his remarks on the section of prayascitta that he is not guilty of theft. 801 The peculiar doctrine of the Dāyabhāga that the widow of a person, whether he was separate or a member of a joint family, succeeded to her deceased husband's estate had been already expounded by Jitendriya.802 The view of Jitendriya was that whatever is acquired by a person without using means or materials jointly owned by all members of a family is his exclusive property and that maitra ( gifts of a friend ) and audvähika are only cited ( by Yāj. ) as examples of this proposition.803 Jitendriya

held the daughter's son entitled to succeed after the daughter, just as Visvarūpa, Bhoja and Govindarāja did. In the Vyava hāramātņkā of Jimātavāhana also Jitendriya's views are cited (on pp. 302, 334 ). This shows that he wrote also on pro cedure in law courts. Jitendriya is also referred to in the Dāyatattva of Raghunandana.804 But no other early writer quotes Jitendriya. Therefore it appears that Jitendriya was probably a Bengal writer and flourished about 1000-1050 A. D. and that he was completely eclipsed by the brilliant Jimutavāhana. 
68. Balaka Balaka like Jitendriya is no more than a name to us. Jimūta văhana's works make frequent reference to him. He held the view that the daughter's son, not being expressly mentioned as an heir by Yāj., came in after those expressly mentioned from the widow to the brother.305 The Dāyabhāga notices that Balaka read a text of Apastamba in a wrong way.s06 Balaka said that the words of Sankha 'svaryatasya aputrasya bhrātrgāmi dravyam...jyesthā vā patnī' apply either to a widow belonging to a caste other than her husband's or to a very young widow or in case her husband was undivided or re-united.807 Balaka says that when some

property is acquired by one brother by means of learning, other brothers are not entitled to that wealth.808 The Daya bhāga refers to a passage from Bālaka in which the latter re lies on the Pūrvamīmāmsă example of mudga and māsa.809 In the Vyavahāramātrkā of Jimūtavāhana (p. 346 ) it is stated that Bāla held the same views as those of Srikara-miśra on a certain point. In the Prayascitta-nirupana of Bhavadeva a writer named Vāloka is mentioned ( vide JASB 1912 at p. 336). This seems to be a Bengali scribe's way of pronounc ing the name Bālaka. Bālaka is mentioned in Raghunanda na's Vyavahāratattva p. 47 also as holding the view with Srikara and others that adverse possession for twenty years conferred ownership in the case of immovable property. Sūlapāņi in his Durgotsavaviveka twice quotes the views of Bălaka and once refutes the latter. $10 Hence it appears that Bālaka was an eastern or Bengal writer, composed a work on several branches of dharmaśāstra ( such as vyavahāra and prāyaścitta) and flourished before 1100 A. D.

rūpa ( Bălarūpamata ) that the words of Yāj. (II. 117 tābhya ste’nvayaḥ ) mean the offspring of tbe mother and on the succession to re-united coparceners are cited. In the Vivāda cintāmani of Vacaspati$12 the views of Bălarüpa are frequently cited. Relying on the words of Parāśara Bālarūpa held that an unmarried daughter was entitled to preference over a married one as an heir to a sonless man. As regards the verse of Hārīta that if a young widow was karkasā ( quarrel some, suspected of unchastity' according to others ), then she was to be given maintenance alone (out of her husband's estate ), Bălarūpa's view was that it refers to the widow of a re-united coparcener. 813 Balarūpa was of opinion that ātma bandhus, pitsbandhus and matsbandhus succeeded in the order stated.:14 The Kālādarśa of Adityabhatta names Bāla rūpa among the authorities on which it relies. This shows that Bālarūpa wrote not only on vyuvahāra but also on kāla. 
As Harinātha and the Vivādacandra mention Bălarūpa he is certainly earlier than about 1250 A. D. The important question is whether Bālaka and Bāla rūpa are identical. I think, though with some hesitation, that they are identical. The difficulty is caused by the fact that Harinătha speaks of 
• the author of Balarūpa,' which implies that Bālarūpa is a work and not an author, while the others speak of Bālarūpa as an author. The Dāyabhāga always speaks of Bālaka and never of Bälarūpa, while the Mithilā writers, Misaru-miśra, Vācaspati and Harinātha, speak of Bālarūpa and not of Bālaka. Bălaka is not mentioned by any writer belonging to a pro vince other than Bengal. It is not likely that there were two early authors belonging to the same locality on vyuvahāra bearing two names so nearly the same as Bālaka (or Bāla ) and Bālarūpa. Moreover, if we read one quotation from the Dāyabhāga between the lines ( vide note 621 ) where Jimūta - vāhana makes fun of Bālaka by charging him with having exposed his Bālarūpatva (being Bālarūpa, being childish ) it appears that the Dāyabhāga looked upon Bālaka and Bāla rūpa as identical.

ancient writer, who flourished certainly before 1100 A. D. As he held the same views as Śrīkara's and an antiquated view about the rights of the daughter's son he must not be later than 1050 A. D. 
70. Yogloka Yogloka like Jitendriya and Balaka is a writer about whom we know only from the works of Jimītavāhana and Raghunandana. He is the last of the series of writers enume rated in one place by the Kalaviveka as having dealt with the subject of kālu (vide note 611 above). The Vyavahāra mātřkā of Jimütavāhana very frequently $15 cites the views of Yogloka and generally twits him with thinking himself as being a logician or a new-fangled (navu-tärkikai-manya) logician. Both in the Kālaviveka and the Vyavaharamātrkā Yogloka is generally cited for being refuted (e. g. pr. 457-58, 465, 483 of the Kālaviveka). It is only very rarely that Jimnātavāhana agrees with Yogloka ( as on p. 369 of the Kāla viveka). From certain passages of the Kālaviveka it follows that Yogloka composed two works, one called Brhad-Yogloka (larger work ) and the other styled Svalpa-Yogloka (a sma ller-work).816 It appears that Yogloka was later than Sri kara and accepted certain illustrations given by the latter, 817 The Vyavaháratattva of Raghunandana informs us that like Srikara and Bālaka, Yogloka held the view that twenty years' adverse possession of immovables conferred ownership ( vide note 624 above ). The same work tells us that the Maithilas followed the view of Yogloka that the verse of Kātyāyana (yadyekadeśavyāptā pi....niņām ) was intended to apply to a case where a litigant threw down the challenge that if even

one out of several items of property charged were brought home to him as having been stolen by him, he would restore all the items claimed, 313 
The foregoing establishes that Yogloka wrote at least on kā!a and vyavaharu and composed two treatises on kūla. 
Jimītavāhanas10 says that is predecessor of his styled Diksita criticized a certain reading of Yogloka's, i. e. Yogloka preceded Dīksita, who was a predecessor of Jimutavāhana. Jimūtavāhana further refers to ancient (purātana ) mss. of Yogloka's work. Hence Yogloka must have preceded Jimūta vāhana by at least a hundred years. He is later than Srikara (note 632 above ). Therefore he must have flourished between 950-1050 A. D. 
71. Vijñanesvara The Mitāksarā of Vijñáneśvara occupies a unique place in the Dharmaśāstra literature. Its position is analogous to that of the Mahabhāsya of Patanjali in grammar or to that of the Kávyaprakāśa of Mammața in Poetics. It represents the essence of dharmaśāstra speculation that preceded it for about two thousand years and it became the fountain head from which flowed fresh streams of exegesis and developments. Under the decisions of the Courts in British India, the Mitā ksară is of paramount authority in several matters of Hindu Law (such as adoption, inheritance, partition etc.) through out India except where, as in Bengal, the Dāyabhāya prevails. 
The Mit. professes to be a commentary on the Yājñava Ikyasmrti. In the colophops of several mss., it is described as Rjumităksarā, Pramităksarā or simply Mitākṣarā. These names are probably due to some of the verses appended at the end of the commentary $20 The Mit. is not only a commen tary explaining the verses of Yājňavalkya, but it is in the

nature of a digest of smrti material. It brings together numerous smrti passages, explains away contradictions among them by following the rules of interpretation laid down in the Pūrvamīmāṁsā system, brings about order by assigning to various dicta their proper scope and province (vişayavyavasthū ) and effects a synthesis of apparently unconnected smrti injunctions. 
The Mit. quotes a host of smrti writers and six pre decessors, who were commentators and authors of digests on dharmaśāstra.821 Besides, it quotes Vedic works (like the Kāthaka ), the Brhadāranyakopanisad, the Garbhopanisad the Jábālopanisad and other works like the Nirukta, Bharata ( author of Nātyaśāstra ), Yogasūtra, Pāṇini, Susruta, the Skandapurana, the Visnupurana, Amara, Guru (i. e. Prabhākara ). 
A noticeable feature of the Mit, may be mentioned here. Though it quotes from more than 80 Smirtis and Smrtikāras it is very chary of quoting from the Purāṇas. Only five Purățas are mentioned by name in the Mitāksarā viz. the Brahmāndas22 ( one verse on Yaj. III. 30), the Bhavisyat (on 
ame are:

Yāj. III. 6), Matsya ( Mit. on Yāj. I. 297-298 quotes eleven verses from the Matsya, chap. 94. 1-9 verses and verses 11-12 of Chap. 93 of the same ), Visnupurāna ( 15 verses are quoted on Yāj. III from the Visqupurāna about Nārāyaṇabali for one who committed suicide ). Skandapurāna on Yāj. II. 290 (Smaryate hi Skandapurāne Pañcacūdā nāma kāścanāpsara saḥ tatsantatir--veśyākhyā pañcainījātih). 
This sparing use of Puränas in the Mit. is in consonance with Yāj. I. 3 which states that fourteen are the sources of Vidya and of Dharma, viz. Purāna, Nyāya ( Tarka or logic), Mī. māṁsā, Dharmaśāstra, the Angas ( six auxiliary lores of the Veda ) and the (four) Vedas. It should be noticed that the fourteen classes of works are enumerated in a rising scale of importance and authoritativeness i, e. the Verlas are the highest authority on matters of Dharma and the Purānas are the lowest. Dharmaśāstra is given a high place after the Vedas and Angas. All early writers hold that the Veda is the başis of Dharma and so are the Smiştis (vide Gaut. Dh. 1-2, Vas. 1.4, Manu II.6 ) and Manu states (11.10 ) that Smộti means Dharmaśāstra. 
The Mitākṣarā is, in the matter of citing Purāṇas as authorities, in great contrast to the Kalpataru and the com mentary of Aparārka. In the very first Kānda ( Brahmacāri ) of the Kalpataru eleven Purānas are quoted as authorities viz. Aditya, Kālikā, Devī, Narasimha, Brahma, Brahmānda, Matsya, Mārkandeya, Vāyu and Visnu and of these the Brahma is quoted 11 times, Bhavisya 28 times and Visņu 11 times. Taking the last Kānda (on Moksa), among the works cited as authorities seven Purānas figure viz. Narasimha, Brahma, Brahmānda, Matsya, Märkandeya, Vāyu and Visnu, of which, the Visnupuräna is quoted oftener than any other work ( except the Mahābhārata, the Bhagavadgitã and the Manusmrti ). 
Vide below under 'Aparārka' for the large number of Purānas and Upapurānas ( 22 in all ) mentioned by A parārka. 
Another noticeable feature of the Mit, is that it mentions the views of many Smộti writers with the prefix' bịhat' or 
vrddha'. For example, it quotes verses of Vğddha-Manu on Yāj. II. 135-36, 270, 272, 111.5, 20, 260 and Bșhan-Manu on Yāj. II. 135-136 (on Sapiņda and Samānodaka ); it quotes

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Vrddha-Yāj. on Yāj. III. 1-2 ( one verse ), III. 6, III. 19 (two verses ), III. 289; it quotes Brhad-Yājëvalkya on Yāj. III, 253; it quotes Vrddha-Vasistha on Yãj. III. 20 ( prose ), Yāj. III. 21 ( verse ), III. 24 (four verses on 'āśauca' in one of which the view of Yama is mentioned ), on Yāj. III. 311 (prose); it quotes Brhad-Vasistha on Yāj. III. 287 ( 244 verses ). Mit quotes Vụddha-Visnu on Yāj. II. 135-36 (prose), on Yāj. III. 266-67 ( verse ); Mit. quotes Brhad-Vişnu on Yāj. III. 20 ( prose ), on Yāj. III. 234-242 (long prose passage on various kinds of pātakas ) and on III. 253 (1} verses ), III. 263-4 ( one verse ); the Mit mentions Vrddha-Sātātapa on Yăj. I. 231 (verse ); Mit. mentions Vrddha-Hārīta ( 24 verses of Vrddha Hárīta on Yāj. III. 266-67 and prose on Yāj. III. 325, on Yāj. III. 254 ( prose ), 259 ( prose), 261 (prose); Mit. on Yäj. III. 261 quotes Vrddha-Brhaspati (1} verses on nine kinds of sankara; Mit. quotes Vrddba Pracetas ( verses ) on Yáj. III. 265 and Brhat--Pracetas ( verses ) on Yāj. III. 20 (one), III. 263-64 ( 14 verses ); III. 265 (2} verses ); Mit, quotes Bịhad-Yama ( 4 verses) on Yāj. III. 254, 255 and 260; Mit. quotes Brhad-Saṁvarta on Yāj. III. 265. 
Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. p. 10 quotes verses of Vrddha-Yāj. enumerating the names of ten expounders of Dharma ( other than those mentioned by Yāj. ). Viśvarūpa on p. 136 (on Yāj. I. 195, MM. Ganapati Shastri's ed. of 1922) quotes a prose passage of Vțddha-Gārgya. 
It would be noticed from the above statements of the Mit. about authors mentioned with the prefixes vrddha and 'brhat', that many of the passages quoted from them are concerned with matters relating to āśauca and prāyaścitta. It is probable that during the centuries of foreign invasions such as those of Hūras and the ascendancy of Buddhism and other schisms, more attention was paid to idealogical matters of purity, penances and the like and additions were made to the already existing Smrtis by means of works to which Mit. words like bịhat, vrddha or 'laghu' were prefixed. 
It may be stated here that Aparārka who is not far re moved in time from the Mit. cites quotations from authors with the prefix Věddha, viz. Gārgya, Gautama, Parāśara, Pracetas, Bșhaspati, Manu, Yājñavalkya, Vasistha, Vyása, Sātāta pa, Hārīta and the word bhat' to Pracetas, Yama, 
F

Manu, Visnu and Hārīta. It is noteworthy that Aparārka (on Yāj. III. 23-24 ) first quotes Manu II. 67 (for the proposi tion that in the case of women marriage has the place of Upa nayana ) and immediately afterwards quotes Vrddha-Manu's verse about the impurity ( āśauca ) to be observed by maidens not grown up, by grown-up but unmarried girls and by those that are married. It is beyond doubt that Apararka regarded the Manusmrti and VỊduha- Janu's work as distinct. The Kalpataru on Vyavahāra quotes Vrddha-Manu eight times, but the first half of one verse quoted as Vrddha-Manu's on p. 402 of ( Vyavahāra-Kānda ) occurs in the Manusmrti VIII. 157. 
The author styles himself Vijñānayogin in the concluding verses of his commentary and later writers frequently refer to him in that way. He belonged to the Bhāradvāja yotra and was son of Padmanābhabhatta. He was a paramahamsu (i, e. an ascetic ) and was the pupil of Uttama. He tells us that when he wrote the Mitāksarā, king Vikramärka or Vikramā dityadeva was ruling in the city called Kalyana 823 ( now in the Nizam's dominion ). The verses at the end containing the personal history appear to be genuine. They occur in the oldest Mss. of the Mit. such as the Government of Bombay Ms. dated śckusamvat 1389. 
The author of the Mit was a profound student of the Pūrvamīmāṁsā system. Throughout the Mit. discussion of Pūrvamīmāṁsā nyāyrts and their application to dlarmaśāstra are sown broadcast. For example, the Mit. on Yāj. I. 81 ( whether it is a niyam'ı or pariseinkh ya ), I. 86, II. 114, II. 126, II. 265 &c., may he cousulted. The Mit., as the very name implies, is generally concise and to the point. But in his desire to make his work a repository and synthesis of varied smộti dicta the author does not mind if he has occagi onally to expand his commentary to enormous lengths. For example, the Mit. on Yáj. III. 265 and 290 occupies several pages of closely printed text. 
A remarkable merit of the Mitāksarā is that it relies on the Mimāṁsā sūtras and maxims for solving difficult and doubtful points in the Dharmaśīstras. A few examples may

be briefly noticed here. On Yāj, I. 4-5 ( where 20 Dharma śāstrakäras are named ), Mit. remarks that these verses are not to be held as parisankhyā ( these verses do not exclude others being recognised as Dharmaśāstrakāras ) but are only illustrative. Parisarikhyā, Niyama and Vidhi are explained at great length on Yāj. I. 79 and 81. On Yāj. I. 249, the Mit. remarks that the verse is a niyama and not parisarkhyā. On Yāj. I. 253-54 the lit. quotes on the question of the Sapindi. karana of one's deceased mother texts of Paithinasi, Yama and Ušanas and brings out order (i. e. makes a vyavasthā ). The Kalpataru on Srāddha quotes Yāj. I. 253-54 ( on p. 257 ), does not quote the varying views of several writers but only one view and makes no vyavasthu on the point. Another example of Vyavasthā on varying dicta of over a dozen writers occurs on Yāj. I. 256, where difference of views of the Dāksinātyas and Udicyas are set out and PMS III. 6.9 is also discussed. Kalpao on Srāddha has no such discussion. On Yāj. II. 114, the Mit. refers to the Lipsāsūtra ( Jaimini IV. 1. 2, in which the word lipsí occurs ) and quotes a passage of Prabhākara (called Guru ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. p. 550 and n. 1027 for this. Vidhis are of two kinds, 'Kratvartha' and Purusārtha' and the Mit. on Yāj. I, 103 holds a discussion on this. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1232-35 for explanations of these two. The particle nañ ('na' meaning 'not') may indicate a prohi bition (pratised ha ) or a provision or exception ( paryudāsa ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 129 remarks that not only in that verse but everywhere in that prekariņu ( Yāj. I. 129-166 ) the particle. naň' conveys 'paryudāsa'. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V 20. 1248-49 for explanation, On Yäj. I. 86 where an objector raises the question that a woman is prohibited from becoming a suti after her husband's death, the Mit. refers to the Syena pága and points out that the Syenayāga passage is entirely different in purport from passages about the practice of Sati. Vide on this H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 1183 and 1245 
The Mit, refers to the division of Vikulpus ( options ) into Vyavasthita and Avyavasthita on Yāj. 1. 96; vide ( for exposi tion about Vikalpa H, of Dh. Vol. V pp. 1250-1252. The Mit. is fond of citiny Nyāyas. For example, on Yāj. I. 81 it cites the nvāra nimittāvrttau naimittakam-apyāvartate', which is based on Jaimini VI. 2. 27-29. The same nyaya is mention ed by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 263-264 and on III. 288. On Yāj. II. 126 the Mit. refers to the Daņdāpūpikanyāya, which is very

frequently employed in Dharmaśāstra works. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1344 for other places where it is employed. On Yāj. II. 265, the Mit. refers to the rule of equal division ( samam syāt-asrutivãt) PMS XV. 3. 53, which is referred to by several works ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. p. 1350 for other references. Some Jaiminisūtras are mentioned as Nyāyas e. g. 'ekārthās--tu vikalperan’iti nyāyenaikārthānāmeva vikalpo na dandata pa sor-ekārthatvam' on Yāj. III. 257, the sutra being P. M. S. XIII, 3. 10. Vide also śāstroktam phalam prayoktari iti nyāyenādhikārikartrgata phalajanakā devakūpa-tadāga nir māndayah' ( Mit. on Yāj. III. 227 ). This refers to Jaimini III. 7. 18-20, the first sūtra which begins with Sāstra phalam prayoktari’. On Yāj. III. 220 Mit. refers to the Jātestinyāya (explained in H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1343). On Yāj. III. 226 the lit. applies the Rātrisattranyāya for which vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1227. On Yāj. III, 298 the Mit. follows Sabara's bhusyu saying 'kim-ivät vacanam na kuryāt? This is frequently mentioned by Sabara and Dharmaśāstra works ( in slightly different forms ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V p. 1345 for references. The Masa-mudyanyāya based on Jai. VI. 3. 20 is relied upon by the Mit. on Yäj. II, 126 for an explanation of which vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1347. 
One of the well-known maxims of the Pūrvamīmāṁsā is called Sarvasākhā-pratyayanyāya' or sākhăntarādhika. raņa-nyāya (Pūrvamīmāṁsā-sūtra II. 4. 8-33). This means that all the sākhās ( branches ) of the Veda and the Brāhmana works attached to the Vedic recensions form one corpus, that such rites as Agnihotra or Jyotistoma are one and the same, though the details may vary here and there in the Vedic works. The Vedāntasutra (III. 3. 1-4 ) accepts the same position about the Upanisads as regards Upā sanās. This maxim was extended to Smrtis also by such writers as Visva rūpa, Medhätithi, Vijñāneśvara and Aparārka. The result was that an option was given where Smrti passages were in conflict, otherwise all details in the several works were to be added up. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 32582+ states this, as also on other occasions (e. g. on Yaj. I. 4-5). Vide pp. 1272-74 of Vol. V of H. of Dh. for explanation and references.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Mit. quotes hundreds of verses simply as 'vacanam' or 'vacanāt' or as 'smarana' or smrtyantaram' and some times verses so referred to are well-known and are found in Smộtis like those of Manu aud Nārada. For example, on Yāj. 1. 80, it quotes the verse · Pumān pum'sosdhike'as a vacana; it is Manu III. 49. On Yāj. I. 87 the Mit. quotes Prāgupa nayanāt... bhaksāh' as smarara though it is a well-known sūtra of Gaut. II. 1. ). On Yāj. II 305 the Mit. quotes Pado gacchati ... rājānam-rcchati' as a vaçana, which is a well known verse of Manu 8. 18 and Nārada (3. 12). On Yāj. II. 49 Mit. quotes as a vacana Bhāryā putraśca dăsaśca &c' which is Manu IX. 416. On Yaj. I, 90 Mit. quotes as 'smarana' a half verse which is Manu X. 41. Some verses quoted as Manu's are not found in the Manusmrti. For example, on Yāj. I. 179, a verse 'Yathăvidhi niyuktastu... vimśatim'is cited as Janu's but it is not found in the present Manusmrti. In introducing Yāj. I. 217-218, Mit. quotes as Manu's the verse 'Dadyād--a harahah śrāddham' &c. which is not found in the Manusmrti. On Yāj. III. 18 the printed Mit. ascribes the verse "asvargyam...caren-na tu' to Manu. but it is really Yāj. I. 156. On Yāj. I. 8 Mit. quotes · Yatrai kāgratā tatrăvisesát' as from Patañjali's sūtra work. It is really a sítra of the Vedāntasūtra ( IV. 1.11 ). 
Ou Yāj. 1. 224 the Mit. quotes 'Vrddhau ca mātā pitarau... Manura bravīt' as 'Samānadarśana' (meaning probably Manusmrti ). That verse is printed ( within brackets) in several editions of the Manusmrti after XI. 10 ( as in Mandlik's and Nir. ed. with Kullūka's com.). It is possible that some of the mistakes pointed out above are due to scribes. Yāj. II. 165 provides a fine of 'ardhatrayodaśapaņa’ for a cowherd through whose fault a cow or other domestic animal dies. The Mit. explains this as 134 panas, but the explanation of the Mit. is against the rules of grammarians (as laid down by tbe Vārtika un Pān. II. 2. 24 and the Mahābhāsya thereon (Kielhorn vol. I p. 426 ), and vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. pp. 140, 499 and notes thereon. 
A striking feature of the Mit. may be noted here. 
The whole of the Mit. printed at the Nir. Press (of 1926 ) with the text of Yāj. comes to 492 closely printed pages; the ācāradhyay with 368 verses covers only 112 pages, the 2nd on V yavahāra with 307 verses occupies 181 pages, while the third adhyāya of 334 verses covers 199 pages. That shows 
11. Vijñānesvara 
. 
607 
that the Mit. spends nearly twice as many pages on the third adhyāya ( that has a lesser number of verses ) as on the 1st adhyāya. That also conveys that Prāyaścittas and cognate matters had come to hold a far greater grip on Hindus at the end of the 11th century than in the days of Visvarūpa, who devotes 201 pages to first adhyāya of 363 verses, 98 pages only to Vyavahāra (310 verses ), and 180 pages to 3rd adhyāya of 330 verses. 
As the Mitāksară names Viśvarapa, Medhatithi and Dhåreśvara, it must have been composed after 1050 A. D. The Smộticandrikā 825 of Devanna bhatta (which as will be seen later on was composed about 1200 A, D ) several times criti cizes the views of the Mit., viz. the latter's remarks that the giving of an additional share to the eldest son is disapproved of by the people, the reasons given for preferring the mother to the father and the definition of dāya. 
King Vikramaditya VI of the Cālukya dynasty with his capital at Kalyāna ( or - ņi) ruled for about fifty years, from about 1076 A. D. to 1126 A. D.826 Fleet pointed out on. p. 446 of Bombay Gazetteer ( vol. I, part 2 ) that the Vadageri In scription proves that the coronation of Vikramaditya VI took place sometime before the 5th of the bright half of Phālguna in the year Yala, suka, 998 i. e. before the end of Saka 999 (current 1076-77 A. D. ), and that the Cālukya Vikrama era started very probably from Caitra-śuddha 1 of

the year Nala, saka 998 ( expired ), corresponding to 8th March 1076 A. D. As regards the date of his death it may be observed tbat the Chikkavadavatti Inscription (South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. XI part 2 No. 178 pp. 236-239 ) belongs to his reign and cites Cālukya Vikrama year 51, Pară bhava, Māgha, “ukla 5, Wednesday, corresponding to 19th January 1127 A. D. Since his son and successor Someśvara III is known to have counted Parābhava as his first regnal year (Bom. Gaz, Vol. I part II p. 455 ) the death of the father Vikramālitya VI and the accession of the son seem to have taken place between 19th January and March 14 (end of Phálguna ) in 1127 A. D. This indicates that Vikramaditya passed away sometime between 20th January and Ist March of 1127. Therefore, it would be accurate enough to hold that Vikramāditya VI ruled from 1076 A. D. to 1126 A. D. The 4th verse827 at the end of the Mitāksarā may be translated thus: 
On the earth, there never was, nor is, nor will hereafter exist a capital similar to Kalyāņa ; a king like Vikramárka was not seen or even heard, and moreover another matter is that the Pandit ( called ) Vijñāneśvara has no one else for comparison with him ; may this triail that is like Kalpalatiká (the fabu lous desire-yielding plant ) firmly endure till the end of the worlu '. In verse 6 at the end Vijñāneśvara prays. May king Vikramāditya, whose feet are refulgent with the brilliance of the dialems on the heads of kings bowing down from the eastern ocean, protect as long as the moon and stars last the whole world from the Setu of Rāma (in the South ), from the

Himalaya (in the North ), from the Western ocean with its waves rising high on account of the movements of shoals of fishes. The prayer in verse 4 is expressly limited. Verse 6 ( at end ) expresses only a pious hope. No single Indian king can be said to have ruled during historical times over the country from the Himālayas down to Rāmeśvara. 
The lowest limit for Vijñānęśvara is provided by the fact that at the end of his work he refers to Vikramaditya Cālukya who had become a great king and prays that the monarch may live long. As seen above the Cālukya king passed away sometime in the first two months of 1127 A. D. Therefore, the completion of the work cannot be placed in any case beyond 1125–26 A. D. But such an erudite and exhaus tive work cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore it would have to be held that the work was spread over some ġears and the period that can be properly assigned to its being undertaken and finished by a Pandita single-handed must be placed between 1100 to 1120 A. D. The present author holds that Dr. Derrett is wrong in following the late Professor R. Aiyangar in placing the Mitākṣarā between 1121-25 ( as he does in J. I. H. vol. 30. pp. 35-55 at p. 36 ). 
No one has put forward any positive and reliable evidence for being so cocksure about the exact date of the Mitaksarā. It is impossible to assign the completion of the Mităksarā to a date later than 1126 A. D. How much earlier it was com pleted it is difficult to say. It mentions Dhāreśvara (Bhojadeva ) who ruled between about 1005-1054-55 A. D. Therefore the Mit. was composed some decades after 1055. That is all. There is no positive evidence to put it between 1121-25 A. D. That is purely conjectural and arbitrary. There is no evidence to establish the exact time when the work was undertaken. 
The period of the writing of the 14 kāņdas of Kalpataru has to be placed at the earliest between 1125-1145 A. D. ( as argued below under the heading 'Kalpataru') i. e. some years later than the completion of the Mitāksarā. In the colophons Vijñāneśvara is described as Paramahamsa and Parivrājaka ( a sannyăsin ). Acc. to the Anuśå sana parva ( 141. 89 ), the Vaikhānasasūtra VIII. 9 and several other authorities asce tics were of four grades, the last being called Paramahamsa ; vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 938–940. But, in medieval times and later all parivrājakas ( ascetics ) were spoken of or 
1. D.—77 
610 
History of Dharmasastra 
TY 
addressed as 'paraihahamsa'. In verse 4 at the end he des cribes himself as Pandita. That tends to suggest that the work was undertaken when he was not an ascetic and became an ascetic about the time of the completion or after the comple tion of the work, 
Dr. Derrett, in his paper on 'New light on the Mităksarā as legal authority'( in J. I. H. Vol. 30 pp. 35-55 ) holds that the comment in the Mit. on Yáj. II. 4 proves that Vijnāneśvara was a judge (note 6 p. 37). I regret that I cannot accept such a facile assumption. Yāj. II. 4. states that the sabhyas (members of the court of justice ) that give a decision opposed to the dicta of smộtis owing to partiality, greed or intimida tion should each be ordered by the king to pay double the amount of fine that would be imposed on a defeated party and Yāj. II. 305 prescribes that the king should review à decision given through partiality &c. The Mit, adds the comment that this provision in II. 4 does not apply if the sabhas delivered a wrong decision through ignorance or folly. 
The Mit. expressly refers to the Mimāṁsā rules ( about vidhi and niyama). It says that as only three grounds are mentioned ( in Yāj. II. 4 ) the provision is to be restricted to these three and is not to he extended to cases of ajñāna, moha and others. Manu IX. 231 deals with cases decided by sabhyas taking bribes and prescribes confiscation of all wealth and Manu IX. 234 provides that if a king's minister or judge renders an improper decision the kiny should himself decide the matter correctly and impose on him a fine of one thousand panas ( this contemplates cases other than those where bribes were accepted ). Nārada ( SBE Vol. 33 p. 22 ) has similar provisions. For laying dowu such a provision and such distinctions ( on Yāj. II. 4 and 305 ) a very learned commenta tor of the first quarter of the 12th century need not have been à judge at all. 
As to the question about Vijñānesvara's original home and later habitation, if any, notbing definite can be asserted beyond this that he lived somewhere in Vikramaditya's realm, probably not far from the capital Kalyāna (in the Bidar District) in what was a few years ago the Nizam's dominion.71. Vijñāneśvara 
611 
In the Preface to his edition of Vyavahārakānda (publish ed in 1933 ) Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar makes the astound ing assertion ( on p. VII ) 'In its ( Mitāksara's ) concluding verses there is a reference to the Kalpavrksa ( the wish-yield ing tree of Heaven ). which has given the title to Laksmi dhara's work’, Having undertaken to edit the big work of Laksmidhara, he was blind to the shortcomings of the work and looked on every other work with a jaundiced eye. Verse four refers only to three, the capital, the king and the work of Vijñāneśvara (the words are'etattrayam') and the prayer is that all the three should ( like the desire-yielding heavenly plant ) last for ever, yielding the desires of those who might resort to them. Simply because the word 'Kalpalatikā kalpam'occurs, he jumps to the conclusion that the Kalpa taru is referred to. It is childish like Sakuntala's young son in Kalidasa's play (Act VII ) who on being asked to mark the beauty of the figure of a bird í sakuntalāvanuam ) asks where is my mother' (Sakuntalā ). Whether the Mitāksarā is earlier or later than the Kalpataru cannot be determined by such ridiculous somersaults. It passes one's understanding how a matter ( a work from the North ) completely alien to all three ( Kalyāna, king Vikramārka and the Mitāksarā of Vijñānešvara ) was all of a sudden thrust in a pious prayer in verse 4 by Vijñāneśvara himself, losing all sense of context, relevance and propriety and admitting (if Prof. Aiyangar's suggestion be accepted ) that his own work was inferior to it (as 'Kalpalatikā-kalpam’ would mean, if Kalpalatikā is taken as standing for the work Kolputuru ). 
The editor ( Prof. R. Aiyangar ) was hasty in his remarks in several places. One striking example may be briefly mentioned here. In the Introduction to Rājadharma-kānda p. 19 he quotes Raghuramsa IV. 12 'rājā prakrtiranjanāt'. In this Kālidasa follows what is stated in the Mahābhārata. Sāntiparva ( in 59. 125 ) states ranjitāscu prajāḥ sarvās tena rájeti śabilyate' and in 57. 11, 'lokarajana m-evātra rājuam dharmaḥ sanātanah'). In the footnote 2 on that page Prof. Aiyangar says that this etymology is found in Yāska. One does not know whence he got this. The Nirukta II. 3 ( of Yiiska) derives' Rajan' from the root írāj?. 
Further, Prof. Aiyangar himself shows (in Intro. to Dāna käuda p. 37 )' that by 1118 A. D. Vikramāditya had recon quered almost the whole of lengi and his territory had then 
612 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
really extended from the Western to the Eastern Deccan as prayed for in the panegyric of Vijňáneśvara. This statement of the editor strongly supports the present author's view that the Mit. was completed before 1120 A. D. and the period during which it was begun and completed must be 1100-1120 A. D. 
Two inscriptions have been relied upon by some writers in connection with Vijñāneśvara. The Jutgi Inscription cited in E. I. volume 15 pp. 26-32 is in two parts and contains two dates. The first date is Calukya Vikrama year 4 ( i. e. 1079 A. D.) in which a gift was made to the temple of Råmeśvara, the trustee being Yogeśvara-pandita, the Sisyaparamparā being as follows: Bhujangadattaśisya Tri locanadeva, Sisya Balasuryārya, his pupil Kāśmīra pandita deva, his ģisya Bhairarapanditadeva, sisya Yogeśvara-Pandita deva ( to whom the gift was entrusted ). The second date is Călukya Vikrama year 35 (i. e. 1110 A. D. ), where another gift to the same temple was made and the trustee was Acale śvara-Panditadeva, who was the disciple of Yogeśvara Pandita deva. In this there is hardly anything positive to show that Yogesvara-pandita is the same as Vijñāneśvara, author of the Mitáksară. The Martur828 inscription of Calukya Vikrama year 48 (i. e. 1124 A. D. ) mentioned by Mr. P. B, Desai in the Karnataka Historical Review (Vol. II No. I p. 48 ) has not yet been published. I learn on inquiry that in this record it is stated that Rama, Soma, Morsing and Biraja were the sons of Kambha and Ketikabbe, that Kamcha himself was the son of Somarāja of Maseyainadu in Attali-nādu and his wife Bhāgyavanite and that he belonged to the Kausikagotra. In the later part the record states that Bibiraja ( who was said a few lines before to have been one of the sons of Kamcha ) was the son (Maya) of Vijñāneśvara Bhattārakadeva ; so it follows that Kamcha and Vijnanesvara-bhattáraka were one and the same person. It may be mentioned that the Inscription states that Vijñāneśvara was the paramarādhya (i. e. most revered one ) of the ruling king Vikramăditya. It is quite likely that this Vijnaneśvara =Bhattāraka was the same as the Vijñāneśvara of the Mitākvarā. But there is no convincing

71. Vijñānesvara 
613 
ground for the identity of the two. There is also one difficulty. The colophons of the Mit. describe the author to have been Vijñāneśvara Bhattāraka ( an ascetic ), son of Pucmancibla bhattis of the Bbāradvājagotra, while in the Martur Inscript tion Kamcha is said to be the son of Somaräja of the Kausika gotra. So one cannot convince a doubter that the two are identical. It is possible that Somarāja might have borne another name ( such as Padmanābha ) and that there might have been an adoption ( so that the gotra was changed ). But these are guesses and there is no strong evidence. 
Out of the numerous commentaries on the lit. those of Viśveśvara, Nandapanlita and Balambhatta are the inost famous. Viele sections 93, 105, 111. Considerations of space preclude any detailed statement of the doctrines peculiarly associated with the name of Vijñāneśvara. There are, however, some which must be mentioned. He laid down ( on Váj. 1. 52 ) that wherever the word sapinda occurred, it denoted either directly or inediately connection with particles of one body (i. e. blood-relationship with an ancestor ). He also strictly adheres to the principle that propinquity is the guidiny principle in matters of inheritance and succession. He divides daya into prctibrnuha and suprutibandhu ani affirmed that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons acquired by birth owner ship in ancestral property. On all these matters hie is diaine trically opposed to Jimūtavāhana. 
Aufrecht in his great catalogue makes conflicting state ments about a work called Aśaucadaśaka. On I. ]». 55 he notes that Āśaucadaśaka is a work of Harihara with a com mentary by Vijñāneśvara and again on I. 1. 571 he ascribes Āśaucadaśaka-ţikā to Vijňáneśvara. On I. p. 762 he ascribes the Āśaucadaśaka and Daśaślokivivarana to Harihara and appears to distinguish him from that Harihara who composed a bhāsya on Pāraskaragrhyasītra. On I. P. 795 he corrects himself by saying that Harihara wrote only the commentary on the Āśaucadaśaka and that the latter is identical with the Daśaślokivivarana. On Ill. p. 121 he is doubtful whether the Aśaucadaśaka is a work of Vijñānesvara. In the Govt. Mss. library at the B.V. R. I., Poona, there is an ancient Ms. (No. 196 of 1884–1887 ) of the Āśaucadaśaka.

History of Dharmaśāstra 1578 Margasirsa (i. e. December 1522 A. D.). It distinctly says that Vijñāneśvarayogin composed in ten Sārdūlavikridita stanzas a work ou īśccucro and that Harihara composed a commentary on it. In the Bhadkamkar collection there is an old Ms. of the Asaucadaśaka, the colophon of which ascribes the work to Vijnanesvara. Vide I. O. cat. p. 565, No. 1749 for a ms. of Āśaucadaśaka with Harihara's commentary dated Secitatit. 158:) ( 1532-33 A. D. ). That the Asaucadasaka was a very popular work follows from the several commentaries thereon that are available even now. Raghunātha, 30 son of Madhava and nephew of the famous Nārāyaṇabhatta, compos ed a commentary on the Dasasloki in Sulee 1500 (No. 82 of A. 1882-83 in the Govt. Iss. lib. at the B. O. R. I. Poona ). There is another commentary on the same work by Bhattoji ( No. 99 of 1882-83 at the B.O. R. I. Poona ). Harihara quotes in his bhāsya besides several well-known smrtikāras, a work called Viśvādarśa ( folio 4b ).831 Harihara, the commentator of the Pāraskarasgrhyaútra, is described as the pupil of Vijñāneśvara in several mss. Harihara in his bhäsya on Páraskaragrhya quotes Vijñāneśvara and Kalpataru. The Visvadarsa praises Vijiluuesvara very highly.s32 Therefore, it appears that Vijñāneśvara composed the Aśaucadaśaka ulias Daśaśloki and that Harihara, who was either Vijñāueśvara's

pupil or not very far removed from him (as he is quoted by Hemādri ) composed a commentary thereon. The first verse of the Daśaslokí is cited below as a specimen of the concise style attempted by the author.833 The text of the Daśaślokī is given on pp 832-833 of volume 4 of the H. of Dh. 
Aufrecht (II. p. 50 and I. p. 236 ) credits Vijñāneśvara with a bhāsya on Trimsat-ślokī, a work in thirty Sragdhară stanzas on ağırara. This work together with the commentary was printed in pothz size at Benares in saivat 1918 (1861-62 A. D.). The printed text contains834 the same colophon at the end and date as the D. C. ms. No. 217 of 1879-80, which was copied in sumvut 1711 Citru (i. e. April 1655 A, D.). It is extremely doubtful, however, whether Vijñāneśvara wrote a bhāsya on the Trimsat-śloki. In the bhāsya Vijñāneśvara and the Mitākşară are cited by name. 835 The manner of referring to them rather suggests that the commentary on the Trimsat-śloki was composed by some person other than Vijaanešvara, who, however, drew largely on the Mit. There is a ms. of the Trimsat-slokī with a com mentary in the Bhau Daji collection which is ascribed to Hemādri on the cover ( vide BBRAŞ. cat. vol. II. p. 209, No. 667). 
In the Madras Govt. mss. library there is a ms. of the Vyavahārasiromani of Nārāyana, who says that he learnt dharmaśāstras under Vijñāneśvara ( adhitya dharmaśāstrāņi Vijñāneśvara-sadguroh ). The work deals with the vyavahūra portion and was composed for the benefit of the un-initiated (bālabodhārtham ). The ms. contains the portion dealing with the king's duty to look into the disputes of people, the

Unfortunately no ms, of it has been recovered so far, but it has been profusely quoted by a large number of writers on the several topics of Dharmaśāstra. Unexpected light has been thrown on it hy the publication of the Bralima cărikāņla of the Kalpataru, composed by Laksmidhara, the chief muntriin of the Gāhadvāla king Govindachandra of Kanyakuhja ( Kanoj ) and Banaras. In verse 10 of the Intro duction to Brahmacārikānda he says 'by him this Kalpa rekja is spread ( trnynte kalpavrkşah )'. In verse 11 he says that a friend of his called Gopåla comprosed a digest based on Smrtis anil adeled his own remarks in prose (Gopālastad Vayasyali avakřti-viracanam vākyarūpena cakre ) and that 
this digest will be composed and it will delight learned men'

(Vibudhajanamanohári hūrisyatesyum...prabandhaḥ' verse 11 ). In verses 12 and 13 he names three works viz. Mabār nava, Kamadhenu and Ratnamālii. 
Some later writers appear to ascribe the Kāmadhenu to Gopāla e. g. the Vyavahāraratnākara 38 quoted below does so. It may be stated that Laksmīdhara makes disparaging remarks about his friend's work (in Introductory verse II ) and that in the Kalpataru which extends over hundreds of printed pages neither Kāmadhenu nor Gopāla is mentioned by name even once, though on his own showing the Kāmadhenu had been completed by the time Lakşmidbara became chief mantrin of Govindacandra, after sanguinary battles in which he boasts that he had killed one hundred thousand (or several hundred thousands ) of his king's enemies and undertook the composition of his huge digest, which must surely have taken about twenty years for being completed. Laksmidhara's patron, the Gāhadvāla kiny Govinilacandra, ruled from 1114 A. D. up to about 1155 A. D. (as will be shown later under Kalpataru ). Therefore, it is proper to hold that the Kāma dhenu must have been composed about 1100 A. D. some years before the Kalpataru was begun ( probably some years after 1114 A. D. when Gorindacandra became king ). 
Sridharācārya, author of Smrtyarthasara ( verses 4 and 5), mentions Kamadhenu among the authors and works on which he relies. $39 The Hāralatā of Aniruddhabhatta, the Guru of king Ballālasena of Bengal, who composed his Dānasăgara in saka 1091 ( 1169 A. D. ), mentions Kāmadhenu among the works he consulted and refers to its views several times.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Virădaratnākara of Canleśrara relies upon the Kāmadhenu several times.840 In the Rājanitiratnākara of Candeśvara ( ed. by Jayaswal, 1924 ) Rājaniti-Kamadhenu is quoted (on p. 2 ) for the definition of rājā ) and on p. 5 the same work is quoted for describing the two kinds of 
adbiśvara' (overlord ). Besides, the same work on p. 81 mentions the idea of Gopāla, Lakşmidhara and Srikara that in the king's wealth all beings, poor, helpless and others have a share and on p. 84 of the same work the view of early Gopāla is again mentioned as to the rites of coronation mentioned in works on Răjanīti being merely illustrative and that a king may be proclaimed to be so according to the special usages of countries and families by being merely seated on a throne.341 
Many Dharmaśāstra works do not expressly state that Kamadhenu was composed by Gopāla. Therefore, the ques tion about the authorship of the Kamadhenu has to be dealt with, 
The reply is that, bearing in mind the paronomastic verse of the Vyavahāraratnākara cited above, and the facts that the Brahmacãrikānda of the Kalpataru expressly meations Gopāla as a friend of Laksmidhara and also mentions the Kamadhenu in rerses 10 and 11 and does not expressly name anyone else as the author of the Kåmadhenu and as no early work ascribes it to any other person the authorship of Kamadhenu, it should be held that Gopāla is the author of the Kamadhenu. 
Aufrecht in his great Catalogue (I. 93 ) ascribed the authorship of the Kāmadhenu to Sambhu. Whence he derived this information is not clear. Sambhu is credited by the Smộticandrikā with the authorship of a Smrti digest ( vide above under Srikara ) and the Smộtyarthasāra dames him as one of its authorities. Therefore, Sambhu is certainly earlier

than 1150 A. D. The Smrtyarthasara mentions both Sambhu and Kāmadhenu as its authorities. If Sambhu were the author of the Kāmadhenu according to the Smrtyarthasāra, he would not have been separately mentioned among its authorities by the Smrtyarthasāra ; so I am inclined to hold that Sambhu was not the author of Kamadhenu, but it was Gopāla who was the author of that work. 
It may be noted that the Krtyaratnākara842 of Candeśvara regards the Kamadhenu as holding the same position (or authority ) as the King (i. e. Bhoja ) 
As the Kāmadhenu had been completed some years at least before the project of the Kalpataru was started and as it is several times quoted in the Hāralatā of Aniruddha it cannot be placed later than about 1100 A. D. It cannot be earlier than that date since it is not mentioned by Medhătithi, the Mitāksarā or hy Apararka. It may, therefore, be assigned to the period 1100-1110 A. D. 
In the edition of the 1st volume of this history, the present author had quoted from a ms. of the Kalpataru ( Benares College transcript ) that the Kalpataru referred to the views of Prakaśa, Halāyudha, Kamadhenu and Părijāta. In his edition of the Kalpataru on Vyavahära, Prof. Aiyangar (pp. 394-398 ) tries to show that the mss of the Kalpataru ( which were only a few ) were in bad shape and he held the ms, of Kalpataru had been tampered with when it mentioned 'Prakāśa, Halayudha-Kāmadhenu-Pärijātaprabhịtayaḥ' ( vide p. 395 of the edition of Kalpataru on Vyava hāra ). About the Kamadhenu and Prakāśa at least, merely saying that the passage about them was later interpolated would not help the editor at all, as both are expressly named in the Introductory verses of the Bralımacărikauda. The Prakāśa is referred to in several ways as Sinti-Mahārnava or simply Mahārnava or as Smrti-Mahārnava-prakāsas+} or as simply Prakāśa. The Mahā

rņava is expressly mentioned in Introductory verses 12-13 to the Brahmacárikānda. The Mahārnava is also mentioned at p. 134 of the Brahmacārikamla. The Mahārnava-prakāśakāra is expressly referred to in the Sraddhakanda ( on p. 262 ) of the Kalpataru. The editor cites no grounds for holding that Pārijāta is a late work. 
It is not necessary for me to establish that the passage is genuine and so I leave it out of account altogether. From the Brahmacărikānda it is clear that the Kamadhenu itself had been composedd some decades before the vast digest called Kalpataru was completed. It follows from what is stated above that at least three out of the four works ind authors mentioned in the passage are certainly uliler than the Kalpa taru and that the 4th riz Halāyudha might have been a junior contemporary of Laksmidhara. Evidence of comparati vely early works is set out below that works composed about 1150-1170 A. D. frequently cite the Kamadhenu but they do not cite the Kalpataru even once. 
The bad state of the mss. of the Kalpataru will be briefly indicated under the section 'Kalpataru'. The Brahmacāri kānda of the Kalpataru is based on a single defective ms. as mentioned in a footnote on p. 279 of the edition. The Kāma dhenu has been quoted or referred to very early after 1100 
A. D. A few instances may be cited. 
Aniruddhabhatta was a qurul of king Ballálasena of Bengal (as stated in verses 6 and 7 of the Dānasagara, 844 which he composed in Sake 1091 ( i. e. 1169 A. D. ) with the assistance of his guru. Aniruddha is the author of two works viz. Hăralată and Pitrdayiti. Therefore, these works$45 must be

assigned to about 1150-1170 A. D. The Haralata on pp. 41, 117, 174 mentions Kamadhenu expressly, as the quotations cited below will show and does not mention the Kalpataru at all. 
___ The Chanddogahmikasis of Sridatta (about 1270-1300 A. D.) mentions the Kamadhenu several times (e. g. on pp. 12, 16, 17, 22, 24, 46, 58 &c ) and the first verses of that work and of Pitrbhakti are interesting because they mention the doctrines of Gopāla and Bhūpala; Bhūpāla is Bhoja and Gopāla is the author of the Kamadhenu. One or two striking references to the Kamadhenu are cited below in the footnote. 
The Ratnākaras of Canleśvara frequently quote the Kamadhenu. The Krtyaratuäkara mentions it on pp. 30 and 299. The Vividaratnakara mentions Kamadhenu very often as on pp. 80, 114, 133, 150, 409, 651. The Dandaviveka of Vardhamāna quotes Kāma henu 25 times and whenever the Kāmadhenu and Kalpataru are inentioned together it puts Kamadhenu first; vide pp. 28, 34, 71, 138, 176, 217. 
But it seems to me that they are identical. Aufrecht in his great catalogue (1. 93 ) ascribes the authorship of the Kāmadhenu to Sambhu. Whence he derived this information is not clear. The authors and works cited by him do not, so far as I know, ascribe the Kanadhenu to Sambhu. It is true that Sambhu is credited by the Smrticaudrikā with a digest on dharmuścīstra ( vide note 563 above) and the Smrtyartha sāra also names him as one of the authorities on which it

relies. Hemādri$47 also tells us that Vambhu was a nibandha kära and refuted the views of Medhātithi on Manu III. 125. The Smrticandriká frequently cites the views of Sambhu on vyavahāra and generally refutes them. For example, on the word 'pitarau' occurring in Yāj. II. 135, Sambhu remarked that no difference should be made between the parent's ( father and mother) as heirs, since whoever out of them took the wealth of their son it would come to both.848 Vide also Smrticandrikā II, pp. 205, 216. Therefore Sambhu also, being mentioned by the Smrticandrikā and the Smộtyarthasāra, is certainly earlier than 1150 A. D. In this state of the autho rities I am doubtful whether Sambhu was the author of the Kāmadhenu. I am inclined to hold that he was not the author of that work and that Gopāla was the author. This conclusion is somewhat strengthened by the fact that the Smrtyrtha sāra mentions both Kāmadhenu and Sambhn as authorities on which it relies. If Sambhu had been, in the opinion of the Smrtyarthasāra the author of the Kamadhenu, the mention of both would have been superfluous. Mr. Jayasval (in JBORS for 1927, vol. XIII, parts 3-4, p. VII ) ascribes the Kāma dhenu to Bboja, but this is wrong ( vide p. 277, note 576 ). 
As the Kamadhenu is named as an authority by the Kalpa taru and the Hăralatā it is certainly not later than 1100 A.D. It cannot be very much earlier since it is not mentioned by Medhâtithi and the Mitāksarā. It may therefore be assigned to the period between 1000 and 1100 A, D. 
73. Halāyudha Several Halāyudhas flourished at different times. Chro nology being rather uncertain those of them that have some bearing on Dharinaśăstra would be dealt with in one place. though an attempt will be made to assign to them approxi mately definite times as far as possible.

73. Halāyudha 
623 
The Vivādaratnākara of Candeśvara mentions Halāyudha dozens of times. In the Smộtisāra of Harinātha 849 Haläyudha nibandha on possession is quoted. The Smrtisāra also says (folio 140 a ) that Halāyudha favoured niyoga by the widow of a son-less deceased person and deprived the widow of su ccession to her deceased husband if she did not submit to niyoga. This was the view of Dhāreśvara also. According to HalāyudhaS50 parents succeeded before brothers to a deceas ed person if the property in the hands of the deceased was ancestral, but that if it was acquired without detriment to ancestral property then brothers succeeded even before parents. Haläyudba is cited in the Vivādacintāmani also e. g. Halāyudhasst held the view that the verse of Yaj. ( II. 126 ) was intended to convey that where joint property was concealed by a member and was discovered after partition, he did not incur the guilt of theft. This same view was held by Jitendriya and others. Raghunandana quotes Halāyudha in his Divyatattra, Dayatattva and Vyavaharatattva. The Vira 
mitrodayas52 also quotes Halāyudha. 
The name Halāyudha (an epithet of Balarāma, the brother of Krsna ) was a common one in India and therefore there are several eminent authors named Halāyudha. Great copfusion is due to this and is increased by unscrupulous writers fawn ing upon patrons. This will be briefly illustrated here.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The first Halayudha is the author of Kavirahasya, edited by Souriudramohan Tagore in 1879 ( with an Introduction in English ) and by Heller in 1900. This contains only 271 verses. It illustrates the several forms of Sanskrit roots in several conjugations and connects all verses with Krsna, a Rāstrakūta king of the Deccan (Daksimāpatha ). This was most probably Rāstra kūța emperor Krsna whose dates range from 940 A. D. to 959 A. D. (vide JBBRAS, Vol. 18 p. 239, I. A. Vol. XI 1. 109 and Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar's Report, 1883-4 pp. 89). In another work called Mitasanjivanī attributed to him (which is a commentary on Pirgala's Chandalısıtra ) there is an illustrative verse praising Muñja alias Vākpatirāja. Muñja was killed between 994-997 A D. by Tailapa. Therefore, this author flourished in the latter half of the 10th century A. D. Vide Cat, of mss. in the Bombay Asi atic Society's library by Prof. H. D. Velankar (1926) Vol. 1 part 2. It begins with the famous verse' *HTKRAFT®'. He has little to do with Dharmaśāstra. 
But the Introduction (pp. I-VI) to the Kavirahasya has some interesting features. It repeats the story of king Ādiśūra of Gauda bringing five learned Brāhmanas of Kanoj for a Vedic sacrifice and of his yrant of five villages to the five brāhmaṇas that enabled them to stay in Gauda. It is further narrated ( in the Intro.) that the foremost among those five brāhmaṇas was Bhatta Nārāyana of the Sandilya-gotra and the rich and famous Tagore's claim descent from that Nārāyana. The Intro. states that his works were Prayogaratna, Gobhila sūtrabhásya, Kāśimaranamuktivicāra and the drama Veni saṁhāra and that Ilalāyula was 16th in descent from that Nārāyaṇa. In a note it is stated that Halāyudha was 12th in descent from Nārāyana, according to another account. In this all chronology is thrown to the winds and entirely false claims to the authorship of famous works like the Prayogaratna, the drama Venīsamhāra and several other well-known works like the Bhāminivilāsa and Rasagangādhara are advanced. Nárāyaṇabhatta, born in 1513 A.D. was the author of Prayogara tna, his father was a Mahārāsýra brāhmana from Pratisthāna (modern Paithan on the Godavari ) and migrated to Benares. That establishes that the work was composed in the 16th century. The author of the Venisamhāra was a Nārāyana, no doubt. He flourished about a thousand years before the author of the Prayogaratna, as passages from the Venīsamhāra

are quoted in the Dhvanyáloka (latter half of 9th century ) and in the Kāvyālar kårasūtravștti of Vāmana (about 8th century). Further, on p. 2 of the Introduction ( to the Kavirahasya ) the Halāyudha of that work is regarded as identical with the author of the Brāhmaṇasarvasva. But the gotra of that Halāyudha was Vätsya, while the gotra of the Tagores is Săndilya. These writings of the matchmakers of Bengal and of the unscrupulous sycophants and panegyrists of rich families are often worthless for chronological purposes. Vide the paper of Jogendracandra Ghosh (in I. C. Vol. I pp. 502-6 ) which tries to show that there were three or four Halāyudhas in the latter part of the 12th century A. D. and the first half the 13th century A. D. 
Another Halāyudha, the author of the famous work called Brāhmanasarvasva, is an important one among the authors named Halāyudha. An excellent edition of that work edited by Dr. Durgamohan Bhattacarya was recently published( 1960) in the Sanskrit Sahitya Parishad Series (Calcutta ) with an exhaustive Introduction (pp. 111-XLV), brief table of con tents, the text (330 pages), an Index of the Vedic Mantras and other verses occurring in the work. The Brāhmaṇasarvasva is referred to several times by Raghunandana e. g. (vol. 1.) in Ahnikatattva pp. 378, 389,423, in Srāddhatattva p. 242. Rarely Ragbunandana finds fault with it as on Srāddha (vol. I. p. 313). Raghunandana mentions the Brāhmanasarvasva also in (Vol. II) Suddhi p. 315, Yajurvedisrāddha p. 492 and the Panditasa rvasva in Vol. I. p. 531 (Prayascittatattva). A Sevasarvasva is mentioned in Mathapratistha (vol. II. p. 618 ), but wbether it is the same as the Saiva-sarvasva mentioned by the Brāhmaṇasarvasva cannot be proved (though probably it is the same). He belonged to the Vatsya gotra and his father Dhananjaya was Dharmādhyaksa (verse 5 of Intro. to Brāhmaṇasarvasva ). 
On him the king bestowed, while he was young, the post of Mahāmahattaka’ and later conferred on him 'Dharmādhi. kāra' (the office of deciding difficult matters of Dharma or the office of a judge ). Vide for the office of Mahāmabattaka' the Bodh Gaya Inscription dated in Laksmanasena year 74 in E. I. vol. III. p. 27 at p. 30. It may be noted that Brbaspati prescribes that the king should build his palace in the middle of the fort and should have the sabha ( hall of justice ) to the

east of the palace and the hall shoule! face the east; and, Kātyāyana states that the sabhā is called 'Dharmādhikarana' where the decision of the truth of the root (of disputes) is carri ed on by considering the rules of sacred law. Halāyudha had two elder brothers.853 Pasupati and īśana, of whom the former composed Srāduha-krtya--parldhati and Päkayajna-paddhati and the latter the Dvijāhnika-paddhati. He tells us in the Brāhmaṇasarvasva that he composed Jimāṁsāsarvasva, Vaisnavasarvasva, Saivasarvasva, Panditasarvasva.Si+ None of these four works has been printed so far and even Mss. of them are rare ( vide Dr. Bhattacharya's Preface to Br. Sarvasva ). 
For the genealogy of Halāyndha, vide J.A.S.B. (New Series ) Vol. XI. p. 332 where a long terligree is given by M. M. Chakravarti, which is based on the chart drawn up, by Bharatacandraširomani for his patron, Prasannakumara Tagore and printed at the beginning of his edition of the Daya bhắga (in 1863 ). It has been shown above how such genea logies are often unreliable. Halāyudha's father was Dhanāñ jaya who had three sons.... Pasupati, Iśāna and Halayudha. Halāyudha mentions Pasupati as 'agraja' (eldest or elder) in verse 24 of BỊ. SAR. and refers to his work called 'puddhati on srāddha. Pasupati's puddhati is mentioned in ( vol. I) Srăddhatattva p. 213 and Pasupati is named in vol. II ) in Udvāhatattva p. 147 and Yajurvediśrāddhatattva pp. 490 494. Pasupati also composeil · Pāka-yajña' paddhati ( vide) Intro, verse 13 to Br.

The chief object 855 of the Brāhmaṇasarvasva is to explain the meaning of the mantras used by Brāhmaṇas in daily ob servances from the brushing of the teeth to going to sleep and in the saintkūrus on birth, marriage, death etc. He wrote for the Vājasaneya Kanva Sākhā and acknowledges856 his debt to Uvata who wrote a bhasia, on the Vajasaneya Samhità in Avanti while Bhoja ruled the earth ( mahīm Bhoje praśāsati ). In some introductory verses and the several colophons of the sections of the Brālmana-sarvasva Halāyudha styles himself āvusathiku, mahadharmadhyaksti or simply durmadhya ksa, dharmadhikarin and his brother Pasupati also is styled āvilsithiku. It is rery difficult to say what the exact meaning of this last word is. It probably means one who regularly performs all the grhyc rites.$57 Āva satha' means'a shed or hall' and a married man has to establish a fire called grhya, aupāsana, kvasathya, or vaivāhika (Manu III. 67 ), aupasada or vairāhana.

The work relies principally on the Tantravārtika and Slokavārtika of Kumārila and on the Sāstradīpikā and deals with the first three udhyāyas of Pūrvamīmāṁsāsūtra and is a good handbook for beginners. It mentions Upavarsa (vol. 17 p. 233 ); Bhārata (vol. 17 p. 301 ); Mandana (vol. 17 p. 289); and Nyayaratnākara (in vol. 17 p. 231 ). For Pandita-sar vasva, vide Triennial Cat, of Govt. Or. Mss.

The time when Halāyudha flourished depends to some ex tent on the time of Laksmanasena, king of Bengal. About king Laksmanasena and the era in his name great controver sies have raged for many years and it cannot be said that the question has been settled heyond cavil. Some facts gathered from the Br. Sarvasva are clear viz. that Halāyudha was the son of Dhananjaya of the Vātsyagotra who was Dharmā. dbyaksa, was opulent and yet fond of performing solemn sacrifices (Intro, verses 5 and 6 ), that Laksmanasena best owed on him patronage beyond his desire. Then the Br. Sar vasva states that Halāyudha was by Laksmanasena made 
rāja pandita' when still in his teens, that king Laksmana sena conferred the distinction of Mahāmahattaka' on Hală yudha when he was a young man and that in his mature years he (Halāyudha ) was given the post of Dharmādhikā. rin '658 (i. e, of the Parişut or Dharmadhyaksa, a high func tionary, possibly a Judge (Intro. verse 12 ). 
Verse 14 of the Intro. to Br. Sarvasva contains the clear words - Dharmadhyaksa-Halāyudhasya sadršo nāsyāḥ priyaḥ kopyabhūt'. On p. 132 of the Br. Sarvasva he describes himself as the officer entrusted with the moneys set apart by

the Gauda king for religious and charitable purposes. The Matsyapurāna 859 states the qualifications of a Dbarmādhikārin. Halāyudha's career runs to some extent along that of Laks manasena, though it is likely that Halāyudha might have been some years younger than king Laksmanasena. 
From the data furnished in the Brāhmaṇasarvasva 360 and from certain facts stated in the Adbhutasāgara and the Dānasāgara the time when Halāyudha flourished can be ascertained as falling within limits acceptable to most scholars. From the Br. Sarvasva we learn that Halāyudha was patro nized by king Laksmanasena when H. was quite a young man. We have some evidence not depending on La. Sam. to 
establish the time when this should have happened. 
King Ballálasena of Bengal began the composition of the Adbhutasāgara in the year 1090 of the Saka era (i. e. 1168-9 A. D. ), but before the work was finished Ballālasena died after requesting his son to complete it and king Laksmanagena made efforts to complete it. We do not know how much time had been spent on the proposed work, Adbhutasāgara, when Ballālasena passed away, nor how much time was taken by Laksmanasena to complete it. We may guess that it was completed before or about 1170-1 A. D. at the earliest. That these verses about the dates in the Adbhutasāgara are not later additions is testified by a reference in the Todarānanda samhitā-saukhya about the position of the constellation of the Great Bear according to the Adbhutasāgara in the saka year 
1082 (1160-1 A. D.) when Ballālasena was ruling. 
The passages quoted in the note establish that the Ad bhuta sāgara was begun in 1168 A. D. by Ballālasena, who passed away before it was completed and that it was complet ed by Laksmanasena, son of Ballālasena (i. e. some time later than 1168-9 A.D.).861 This shows that Laksmanasena began to

rule about 1169 A. D. The Saduktikarņāmetas42 of Sridhara dāsa tells us that he completed the work in the Saka year 1127 (1205-6 A. D.) in the 27th year of Laksmanasena's reign i. e. Laksmanasena began to reign about 1178-79 A. D. and ruled till 1205-6 (probably only in Bihar as he lost Bengal in 1200 A. D.). Thus there are two authenticated dates for the acce ssion of Laksmanasena viz. 1168-69 A. D. and 1178-9 A. D. At the end of the Dānasāgara ( edited by Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya and published B. I. Series in 1953)a verse says the Dānasāgara was composed at the end of Saka year 1091 (1169-70 A. D. ).863 Therefore, the literary activity of Halā yudha would have to be assigned to the period 1160-1200 A, D. The Br. Sarvasva and the Pandita-sarvasva are quoted by Raghunandana in the Smrtitattva as stated above.

From Moslem historians it is learnt that Laksmana sena was defeated by Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1200 A. D. and lost Bengal. 
A few words may be said here about the La. Sam. A large volume of literature has gathered on this subject. I do not propose to enter into great details or to examine the several theories that have been advanced. 
S 
A few salient points alone would be mentioned. Some undisputed facts may be first stated. 
The La. Sam. is still popular in north Bihar and its first year is now regarded as 1119-20 A. D. How and when the La. Saṁ. came to be used in Mithilā is still a matter of conjectur es. It is also clear that Laksmanasena and his sons do not employ the La. Sam. in their Inscriptions. 
Kielhorn concluded that the Sena era began in Sake 1041 i. e. 1119 A. D. ( vide I. A. 19 p. 1-7). The era as employed to-day in Mithilā is usually associated with the birth of Laksmanasena. Kielhorn relied upon Abul Fazl's account that the era started in 1041 śke and on his own examination of six dates. Dr. Rajendralal Mitra (in J. A. S. B. vol. 47 pp. 398 ff) held that the era was started about 1106 A. D. Subhadra Jha (JBORS. Vol. XX pp. 20 ff) places the starting point of La. Sam. between 1108-1120 A. D. on the basis of different calculations. The spurious Bisa pi grant of Sivasim hadeva to Vidyāpati mentious years in four eras prevalent in Mithila (vide I. A. vol. 14 pp. 190–91 ), but hardly any reli ance can be placed on it. Great differences of opinion exist as to the origin of the La. Sam., l'articularly whether it starts from the year of Laksmanasena's birth or from his accession to the throne or whether, after the destruction of the last Hindu dynasty in Bengal, people started the era to preserve the memory of the Hindu rule. K. P. Jayaswal (in JBORS vol. XX pp. 20 ff) discussed this topic with some elaboration. He set out eighteen dates in La. Sam. occurring along with Saka or Samvat dates or both and held that Kielhorn's date was correct. Dr. R. C. Majuindar (in “History of Bengal' vol. I. pp. 233 ff') tried to refute Jayaswal's views and arrived at the conclusion that the initial year of the La. Sam. varied between 1108 and 1120 A. D. Some scholars have been influe. nced by the hingraphy of Dharmasvămin ( a Tibetan pilgrim

who visited Bodh Gaya in 1235 A. D. ), Dr. Roerich published an English translation of the Tibetan mouk's life with the Tibetan text and an Introduction (in 1959). Dr. Roerich states (p. XIV of Intro.) that among the kings the pilgrim visited is Buddhasena, described as king of Magadha residing at Vajrásana or Bodh Gaya. He met the king in 1234 A. D. There are some inscriptions of the ruler of Bodh Gaya that use the La. Sam. There is an inscription of Jayasena, son of Buddhasena. The Janibigha inscription of Jayasena is dated in Laksmanasena's 'Atītarájye La. Saṁ. 83'. Vide JBORS vol. IV pp. 266-272 and JBORS vol. V pp. 273-280 ( Panday). If we take 1118-9 A. D. as the initial year of La. Sam. then the meeting with Jayasena should have taken place about 1201-2 A. D. That is impossible on the evidence of the Tibe tan hermit who met the father Buddha sena in 1234 A. D. So this makes 1118-9 A. D. as the initial date of La. Sam. un tenable. Vide Dr. Roerich's Introduction pp. 13-18 for further details. Dr. D. C. Sircar (in I. H. Q. vol. 34 pp. 21 28 ) also refers to the Tibetan pilgrim's life and holds (on the whole evidence) that the La. Sam was originally counted from the date of the accession of king Laksmanasena of Bengal and Bihar about 1179 A, D., although its starting point was later supposed to be some date between 1106-1119 A., D. through confusion. Dr. B. P. Sinha (in JBRS Vol. 42 pp. 76 81 ) points out that La. Sam. is found in Mithilā Mss. only one hundred years after Laksmanasena's death. Reference may be made to two recent papers submitted to the Indian History Congress at Poona in 1963 ( vide Proceedings, pub. in Calcutta 1964 ) viz by Prof. Radhakrishna Choudhary pp. 93-99 and by Prof. Sukhamaya Upadhyaya pp. 196-202, which latter holds that the initial year of the La. Sam varied between 1080 and 1129 A. D. 
Sourindra Mohan Tagore (introduction to Kavirahasya p. I-II) says that Ādiśūra brought to Bengal five Brāhmaṇas from Kanoj of whom Bhatta Nārāyaṇa was the most famous and was the author of the Prayogaratna and also of the Veni samhāra and that Halāyudha was 16th in descent from that Náráyana. These traditions of the matchmakers of Bengal and panegyrists of big families are entirely worthless for lite rary and chronological purposes, particularly for events of comparatively early times. In their zeal to extol their 
73. Halāyudha 
633 
patron's families to the skies they were most unscrupulous and threw to the winds all chronology. The Prayogaratna was composed at Benares by Bhatta Nārāyana whose family migrated from Paithan in the 16th century, while the Veni samhăra was composed about a thousand years earlier. Yet both works are fathered upon Nārāyana, the ancestor of the rich and influential Tagore family. 
Halāyudha, the author of the Brāhmaṇasarvasva, is, it appears, different from another Halāyudha who was a jurist. In the first place, Halāyudha, author of the Br. sarvasva, states that he composed four other works, all ending in the word. sarvasva' but makes no mention of any work compos ed by him on substantive or adjective law or on both. 
The Vivādaratnākara mentions Halāyudha 53 times and Halāyudba-nibandha three times. The Grhastharatnākara quotes it eight times and the Krtyaratnākara quotes it on pp. 319, 327, 332. 
From Raghunandana's Dāyatattva it appears that Halā yudha had composed a work on law. For example, Hală yudha appears to have held that, if some joint family property was not divided among the coparceners at a partition through ignorance and remained in the possession of one member of the family, it may be partitioned again, but the ignorant possessor should not be charged with theft ( vide Vol. II Dāyatattva p. 182 ).864 Agaio, the Dāyatattva (vol. II p. 195 ) mentions the wrong reading of Yāj II. 139 in the Mitāksarā, Pārijāta and Halāyudha due to the errors of scribes quoted above. 
In this connection it is necessary to say a few words on the two words 'Vyavahāra' and 'Vivāda'. 
In the Br. Up. V. 14. 4 we have the famous remark *caksur-vai satyam' and it is added 'therefore when two persons come disputing about a matter, one saying 'I saw' it' and another saying 'I heard it', we believe him alone who says “I saw it'.” Here the word 'vivāda' is used in the

meaning dispute' and it is also emphasised that seeing a matter is superior to hearing evidence about it. In the same Upanisad (VI. 1. 7) it is said that these prānas ( speech and others having a dispute as to who among them was superior approached-Brahman &c. Therefore the word 'vivāda is ancient enough. The word 'vyavahāra’ was certainly known before Pāṇini ( 11. 3. 57 ) in the sense of 'transactions of sale and purchase and the like'. Ap. Dh, S. II. 11. 28, Manu VIII. 8, Yāj. II. 12 and 81 employ the word Vivāda. Gaut. Dh. S. XI. 19. employs the word Vyvavahāra in the sense of ineans of settling or deciding disputes'. Vas. Dh, S. 16. 1-3 (Atha vyavahārāh i Rājā Mantrī vā sadaḥ-kāryāni kuryāt dvayor vivadamānayoḥ pakşāntaram na gacchet 1 ). Manu VIII. I, Yāj. I. 327, 360 and II. I employ the word (in the plural ) and the sense appears to be the complaints or suits brought by the subjects before the king or the court of justice and Manu VIII. 2, 8-9 indicate that the word 'kāryāni' is used by it in the same sense as Vyavabārān. There are 18 titles (called vyavahārajiadas or vivāda padas ) under which all legal proceedings before the king or the court of justice are classified in Manu VIII. 4. 7 and Yāj. It appears to the present writer that the words .vivāda' and 'vyavahāra' were often regarded even by early writers as synonymous. For example, in Yāj. II. 18 ( sapanaś-ced-vivādah syāt ) it is provided that, if a dispute is brought ( before the king or court ) with a bet, then the losing party should be made to pay a fine and also the amount of the bet to the king and the successful party should be awarded the property (or amount in dispute ). The Mit. on Yāj. II, 18 ( Sapayas-ced vivādaḥ gyát ) paraphrases the word 'vivádah' as 'vyavahārah'. It should be noted that Yāj. II. 4 and 305, contain the same clause viz. 'vivādād-dvigunam damam'. Yāj. II. 4 prescribes that where the members of the court ( sabbyah) render a deci Bion opposed to the dicta of Smộtis, each of them should be made to pay a fine double of what would have been payable by the party defeated in the litigation. Yāj. II. 305 refers to cases, where, after a matter is decided by a court, a review of judgment is sought and the decision is set aside on the ground of miscarriage of justice due to the sabhyas having given a decision opposed to the rules of the smrtis or owing to their being influenced partiality or by bribery and the like. It should be noted that as early as the Amarakośa ( not later

than the 5th century A. D. as shown in H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 840 n. 1367 ) Vivāda and Vyavahāra are said to be synonyms ( vivādo vyavahāraḥ syāt). It is further provided by Manu (8. 43 ) that the King or the man appointed by him as Judge should not himself start a court proceeding against a person. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 3 expressly states that the latter half (astādaśasu mārgesu) has in view the vivădapadas. They are also spoken of as vyavahārapadas, because, in bringing a suit one has to specify the cause of action from among the eighteen. Manu also ( in VIII. 8 ) employs the words 'sthāna' instead of 'pada' and 'kārya 'in the sense of vya vahāra (suit or proceeding). Br. quoted by the Vivāda ratnākara ( P. 4 ) says 'vivādakāraṇānyatra padāni śrṇutā dhunā' on which the Vivādaratnākara remarks 'padáni adhi karaņādi rņādīni'. Aparārka (on Yāj. 11.5) after quoting Manu 8. 43 ) remarks' kāryam vyavahāro vivāda iti yāvat'. Early Smrti works deal with both adjective law and substantive law. For example, the Manusmrti (in chap. VIII. 57-130 ) deals at great length with the law relating to witnesses, oaths, oral evidence, punishments for false depositions and claims. In the same chapter it deals with ādhi, upanidhi, niksepa, possession and ownership, money-lending, and rates ofinterest, topics of Dattāpradāpika and Vetanasyānaprakriya, krītānuśaya, svāmipālavivāda, boundary disputes, abuse and defamation, partition, succession and inheritance, marriage and mixed unions, their children and their rights, the four varnas and their duties and a vocations, offences and puni shments and so on. Yāj. also in the second section first deals with the four stages of a law- suit, viz. plaint, reply, proof of one's claim ( by documents, witnesses &c.) and success or failure of the suit and then proceeds to lay down rules about recovery of debts, pledges and other matters in which dis putes ( vivādas ) arise. Even in comparatively early times the Nārada-smrti dealt only with the procedural law and the substantive law. The Vyavahāra-mayūkha of Nilakantha not only deals with the procedural law, but also with substantive law. On the other hand, the Vivādatāndara of Kamalakara bhatta (first cousin of Nilakantha ) not only deals with sub stantive law (of partition and the rest) but also with the four stages of a suit. There are authors, who wrote separate treatises on vyavahāra and vivādu; for example, Candeśvara composed Vivādaratnākara and also Vyavahāraratnākara and

History of Dhurmaśāstra 
there are two works by Vācaspati called Vivādacintamani and Vyavahāracintamani. Vide Dr. Rocher's paper in J. 0. I. (Baroda ) vol. V, pages 249–265 for Vivādaratnākara and Vyavahāra-ratnākara of Candeśvara 
In this connection it would be proper to refer briefly to the careful and scholarly work done by Dr. Ludo Rocher, a Belgian scholar, on Halāyudha. In J. O. I. ( Baroda, Vol. III, 1953–54 pp. 328–344 ) he brought together a collection of fragments of vivācupadas quoted as Halāyudha's or from Halāyudhanibandha ( he lealt with 34 extracts only in Vol. III ). Then in J. O. I. ( Baroda ) Vol. IV pp. 13-32 he added extracts Nos. 35-102. In J. (). I. ( Baroda ) Vol. V, pp. 325-329 he contributed a paper Halāyudhanibandha on Legal procedure i. e. on Vyavahāra' (only seven fragments ). 
From the fragments it is possible to infer that Halāyudha wrote a pibandha comprising not only substantive law (debts and other topics ) but also procedural law. Halāyudha is quoted dozens of times in the Dandaviveka of Vardhamāna but his work is once mentioned as Halāyudha-nibandha on p. 150 of that work and twice as 'Halāyudha on pp. 119 and 152'. This work deals with six kinds of offences and punish ments for them. Thus it is a work on vyavahāra'. 
Then Dr. Rocher published in 1956 at Ghent the text of the Vyayaháracintāmaņi ( of Vāca spati-miśra ) with English translation and notes and several Appendices including an alphabetical index of quotations in V. C. from Dharmaśāstra works. 
There is yet another Haläyudha. On the Srāddhakalpa sūtra of Kātyāyana a commentary called Prakāśa was compos ed by Halāyudha, son of Sankarsana ( vide BBRAS cat. No. 518, p. 170 ). In this cominentary he refers to Karka, Kāma. dhenu, Kalpataru, Govindarāja, Laksmanopādhyāya, Mitā ksarā, Sankhardhara and Pasupati. He is therefore later than 1150 A. D. He cannot be identified with the author of the Kavirahasya, as the latter flourished much earlier under the Rästrakútas. The special merit of Halāyadha concerning the Br. Sarvasva is that he is much earlier than the great brothers Sāyana-Mädhava who composed Bhūsyus on the Vedas. He explains several hundred mantras which occur in the Rgveda as well as in the Yajurveda. He mentions among his predecessors on the same task Uvața (Br. Sarvasva 
73. Halāyudha 
637 
pp. 233, 256 ) and Gunavisnu (p. 256 Br. Sarvasva ). Halā. yudha's task was, as compared with Sāyana's, very limited, but he brings yreat learning to the task. There is ample material for comparison between the two. Numerous mantras have been explained by both e. g. the mantra at bathing one self 'Imam me Gange' (Br. S. pp. 22-23 and Rg. X. 75. 5). Marjana-mantra 'Apo hi sthă' (Rg. X. 9. 1, Vāj. S. XI. 50 ); the Gāyatri-mantra ( Rg. 111. 62. 10, Vāj. S. III. 35, Br. Sar. pp. 37-38 ),865 San-no devir Rg. X. 9.4, Vāj. S. 36. 12, Br. Sar. pp. 92-93 ); the Aghamarsana mantras (Rg. X. 190. 1-3, Br. Sar, pp. 99 ). 
There is another work called Samvatsarapradipa profu sely quoted by Raghunandana (as in Vol. I Tithitattva pp. 3, 34, 43, 46, 49, 106, Srāddhatattva p. 254). In Ekādasi-tattva (vol. II. p. 51 ) Raghunandana ascribes it to Halāyudha and in Suddhitattra Vol. II. p. 327 also. Some scholars hold that this is Halāyudha's work ( vide Dr. R. C. Hazra in I. H. Q. Vol. 21, p. 54 ), while Dr. Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya (1. H. Q. Vol. 21 p. 147 ) holds that the author of this work is different from the author of the Brāhmaṇasarvasva. The editor of the Br. Sarvasva ( Intro. pp. XL-XLI ) bolds that they are the same and I agree with him. 
For reasons of space it is impossible to illustrate Halā yudha's principles and methods of the exposition of vedic Mantras in the Brāhmaṇa sarvasva and the results arrived at by him. One principle he advocates viz. the meaning of single words in the mantras may have to be controlled by the sense of the sentence or sentences gathered as a whole. For example, the one Mantra San-nu devīr-abhistaye' (Rg. X. 9. 4) is employed as 'snāna mantra ', as also in the worship of planets Saturn ( e. g. vide Yāj. I. 301 ) and in the Brahma yajña (Br. S. p. 110 ). In pp. 37 ff, he well explains the Gāyatri-mantra and he gives it striking explanation of the Aghamarsana mantrase6 of which there is no pudapātha even.

He explains the Gayatrimantra on pp. 37-40 of tbe Br. sarvasva and it is a remarkablo testimony to the Yogiyajanvalkyasmrti published by the Kaivalyadhūma, Lonavala (in 19.31 ), that 21 verses from it are cited by Hallyuciba in explaining Gayatrimantrit.

Ancient Vedic texts insist that one engaged in the perfor mance of a sacrifice or the like must know in the case of a wary mantra the sage, metre, the deity and the purpose ( viniyoga ) for which it is employed and state what undesirable conse quences employing mantras without knowing these details will follow.

Halayudha's remarks on the Aghamarsana mantra are interesting : अस्याघमर्षणस्य व्याख्यानमाचरितुं 'हृदि प्रकम्पो जायते यतः सर्ववेदसारभूतोऽ त्यन्तगुप्तश्चायं मन्त्रः । अस्य पदपाठमात्रं च नास्ति ब्राह्मणनिरुक्तादिकमप्यस्य नास्ति । इत्थमेतदीयव्याख्यानानुगुणं कमप्युपायमप्राप्य यदेतदस्य स्वकपोलमात्रेण व्याख्यानमाचरणीयं तदतिसाहसम् । ब्राह्मणसर्वख pp. 99-100. Still he makes an effort to give a meaning of the Aghamarşanamantra viz, Rg. X. 190. 1-3 as follows : ( on pp. 99-101 ).

The dharmādhyaksa of Laksmanasena was a son of Dhanañjaya, while the author of the Prakāśa was à son of Sankarşana. The Srāddhakāśikā of Krsna (Gujarati Press ed. p. 430) on the Navakandikā or Srāddhakalpasūtra of Kātyāyana says that first Karka 867 explained the sūtra in pregnant words and then Halāyudha explained it and yet it remained as difficult as before. Krsha is mentioned in the Nirnayasindhu and the Srāddhamayukha of Nilakaytha. Therefore Halāyudba, the author of the Prakāśa on Kātyā. yana, must have flourished before 1509 A. D. and later than 1150 A. D. 
There is a work called Karmopadesini ( a manual on the daily religious rites ) ascribed to Halāyudha; vide JASB vol. XI ( new series ) p. 335. This work has been mentioned several times by Raghunandana in his Tattvas e. g. ( Vol. I ) on tithi p. 149, Srāddha p. 195, Prāyaścitta 492, Samskāra 863; (vol. II) Suddhi pp. 323, 334, 358. But in all these places the name of the author is not mentioned by Raghunandana M. M. Chakravarti points out that it quotes the Kalpataru and Sūlapāni on Srāddba. In that case it cannot be placed earlier than the 15th century A. D. and its author would be entirely different from the author of the Brāhmaṇasarvasva. 
Vide J. A. S. B. 1915 pp. 327-336 where M. M, Chakra varti brought together interesting information about Halāyudha. 
74. Bhavadevabhatta 
The Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana and the Vira mitroda ya tell us that Bhavadevabhatta composed a work call ed Vyavahāratilaka on judicial procedure. The Vyavahāra tattva 868 tells us that Bhavadeva read 'astavyasta padavyāpi' instead of 'yadvyastapadamavyāpi' in Kātyāyana's verses

enumerating the blemishes of uttura (defendant's reply). The Vyavahāratattva 869 mentions Bhavadevabhatta's discussion and illustration of a reply ( uttara ) with a weak plea (kārana ). The same work informs us that Bhavadeva held the same views on adverse possession as Srikara, Bālaka and others did ( vide note 624 above), The Vividacandra of Misarumisra87o several times refers to the views of Bhavadeva. The Viramitrodaya371 gives in great detail the remarks of Bhavadeva on the well-known text of Sumantu about killing an ātatāyin. The Sarasvativilăsa 672 and the Vaijayanti of Nandapandita quote the very same views of Bhavadevabhatta on Sumantu's text. 
The foregoing brief discussion shows that Bhavadeva's Vyavahāratilaka must have been a valuable work on judicial procedure. Unfortunately that work has not yet come to light.. 
Bhavadeva also wrote several other works. 
He appears to bave composed a work called Sambandha viveka. In the Saṁskāratattva (Jivananda, Vol. I, p. 890 ) Raghunandana states that Bhavadeva was the author of a work called Sambandhaviveka. The Udvāhatattva also says

the same (Vol. II pp. 111 and 143 Bhavadevabhattīya sambandhaviveka ). Vide an informing paper on 'Bhattabha vadeva of Bengal' by Manmohan Chakravarti in J. A. S. B, for 1912 pp. 333-348 and New Indian Antiquary Vol. VI (1943– 4 ) pp. 252-260 for text of the Sambandhaviveka (based on Manu III. 5 asapindā ca yā' & ) and English Translation, by Prof S. C. Banerji of Dacca. 
In the Govt. Mss. library at the B. O. R. Institute Poona, there are two Mss. (No. 9 of 1895-98 and No. 263 of 1887-91 ) of a work of Bhavadeva variously named Karmānusthāna paddhati or Daśakarma-paddhati or Daśakarmadīpikā. M. M. Chakravarti in his informing article on Bhavadeva (J. A. S. B. 1912, pp. 333-348 ) says that the work has often been printed. I was not able to secure a copy. That work873 deals with the ten principal rites and ceremonies to be performed by Brāhmaṇas who study the Sāmaveda. The principal subjects are :- The Homa to the nine planets ( Navagraha-homa ), mátrpājā, pānigrahaņa and other essential rites of marriage, homa on the fourth day after marriage, garbhādhāna, puṁsa vana, sīmantonnayana, sosyantihoma (homa when a woman is on the point of delivery), jātakarma, niskramana, nāmakarana, annaprāśana, cudākarana, upanayana, samăvartana (the student's returning from the teacher's house after finishing his studies ), Sālākarma (first entrance in a new house ). 
Another work of Bhavadeva bhatta ( who is called Bāla valabhībhujanga therein ) is styled Prāyaścitta-Prakarana (or Nirūpana ). That was published by the Varendra Research Society (Rajshahi, Bengal in 1927), edited by Nani Gopal Majumdar. In this work he deals with the five grave sins mentioned by Manu (XI. 54 ) viz. killing a brāhmaṇa, drinking surā, theft (of gold ), adultery with the wife of a guru and contact with these ( for a year or more ) and also with lesser sins or misconduct such as killing a woman, killing a cow, breaking another's bones, killing beings other than human, eating food from the vessel of a sūdra, touching a washerman or one who deals in hides, taking food without wearing Yajñopavita, penances for condemned

marriages, purification of waters, foodgrains, cooked food &c. Another work composed by him appears to have been called 
Nirnayāmộta'( Ābnikatattva, vol. I p. 326, ‘Bhavadeviya-, Nirņayāmộte Sumantuḥ'). This work was held in high esteem, as the Smộtiratnākara of Vedācārya places Bhava deva after Manu among the authorities on prāyaścitta that he follows.874 The Varsa-kriyā-kaumudi of Govindānanda (B. I. series ) quotes a text from Bhavadevabhatta on the praya scitta for eating in a solar or lunar eclipse ( p. 106 ). 
There is yet another work of Bhavadevabhatta called Tautātitamatatilaka, a ms. of which exists in the India Office (Cat. Part IV p. 190, No. 2166). That work is concerned with elucidating the doctrines of the Purvamīmāṁsā system from the standpoint of Kumārilabhatta (who is also called 
Tautātita ). 
The Tautātitamatatilaka deals with the adhikaranas and not with every sutra in the Mimāṁsāśāstra in the first three adhyāyas of the Pūrvamīmāṁsāsūtra of Jaimini. It has been published in the Princess of Wales Sarasvatibhavana Series (Benares ) in two volumes, the first in 1939 ( pp. 482 ) ed. by Pandits A. Chinnaswami Sastri and Pattabhiram Sastri and the sccond volume ( pp. 483-870 and Index of Quotations pp. 871-907 ( 1944 ) edited by the same scholars. The Sanskrit Introduction sets out all the verses of the prasasti of Bhavadeva inscribed on the wall round the temple building 
The first few verses are quoted below.875 
Besides the Vedas, the Brāhmanas, and Jaimini's sūtras, the Srautasūtra of Āpastamba ( frequently ) and those of Drābyāyana and Satyāsādha ( rarely ), the bhāsya of Sabara, Pāṇini, Manusmrti, Gautama-dharmasūtra are cited.

Hundreds of verses are quoted from Kumārild's Tantra vārtika and Sloka vārtika. Tautātita appears to have been given as a sobriquet to Kumārila. In the drama Prabodhacandrodaya (II. 3 ) we have a verse about the names of some of the works and authors on Pūrvamimāṁsā put in the mouth of a chara 
cter 'Abankāra', the first pāda of which is 'naivāśrāvi guror-matam na viditam Tautātitam darśanam' Some edi tions read 'Kaumārilam darśanam' for Tautātitam darśa nam'. But the com. called Prakāśa' had the word 'Tautā titam'; being unfamiliar to most people it was probably changed to 'Kaumárilam ’ by some later scribes. 
It mentions the bhâsyakāra (Sabara ), Vārtika (folio 12 a ), Gurumata ( 17b), Prabhākara ( 21b), Vārtikakāra pāda ( 22 b, in the plural). It frequently quotes kārikās from the Tantravārtika with the words 'taduktam'. Hemādri976 quotes Bhavadeva's explanation of the words of Kumārila allowing an option between jūghunya and ājya and disapproves of it. Vide Tri. Cat. of Madrs Govt. Mss. for 1919-1922, p. 5527 for the same work, 
Raghunandana in his vast Smrtitattva mentions Bhava devabbatta's views dozens of times, several times for criticizing him or discarding his views (heyam' is the word often used ) Vide, for example, Tithitattva 877 (vol. I pp. 95, 99, Samskāra tattva p. 887,889-90, Udváhatattva, vol. II p. 130 ). But it should be noted that Raghunandana also accepts his views several times, e. g. in Vyavahāratattva, vol. II p. 213, 216, Suddhitattva pp. 240, 312. In modern times also Sâmavedins in Bengal follow Bhavadevabhatta as regards religious rites, while other Brāhmaṇas rely on Ragbunandana's works.

History of Dharmasastra 
Unexpected light is thrown on the personal history of Bhavadevabhatta by an inscription found in the temple of Ananta Vasudeva at Bhuvanesvara in the Puri District of Orissa edited by Kielhorn in E. I. vol. VI, p. 203, which eulo. gises Bhavadevabhatta, the identity of the author Bhavadeva with the person eulogised being established by the unique epithet, Bālavalabhībhujanga applied to the latter.878 The eulogy is composed by a person called Vācaspatikavi. Bhava. deva belonged to the Sāvarṇa gotra of the Kauthumi school of the Sāmaveda. The family belonged to Siddhalagrāma in Radha ( west of the Hugli and south of the Ganges ). The pedigree given in the inscription is : Bhavadeva ( who received from the Gauda king in gift the agrahira of Hastinibhitta ) son Rathānga-son Atyanga-son Budha-son Sri Adideva ( wife Sarasvati), who was Prime Minister of Vahaya king )-son Govardhana ( wife Sāngokā, daughter of a Vandyaghatiya brāhmana- ) son Bhavadeva Bāla valabhibhujanga, Minister of Harivarmadeva and his son. In the Inscription he is declared to be a second Varāha (i. e. Varāhamihira ). Vide pp. 478 480 ( of H. of Dh. Vol. V ) for the three branches of Jyotişa. The Brhatsambitā of Varāhamihira states that Jyotiḥ-śāstra has three branches ( skandhas ) and a work dealing with all three branches is called 'Samhita' (Bỉ. S. I. 9). The three branches are called Ganita or Tantra, ( mathematical calcula tions of the motions of planets &c ), Horā ( or Jātaka ) that dealt with horoscopes and astrology and the third was called Sākhả. The inscription further claims that Bhavadeva was an expert in the Pūrvamīmāṁsā as propounded by Kumārila

bhatta, was also an expert in Ayurveda. ( medicine) and abstravidya ( the science of arms ). With the advice of Bhava deva, king Harivarmadeva is said to have reigned long in prosperity. Bhavadeva is stated in the above-mentioned inscription to have composed works on horā ( astrology ), smrti and mimaisā. Bhavadeva is eulogised as a great builder. He constructed a reservoir of water in Rādhā, he set up a stone image of Nārāyana and founded a temple in which he placed images of Nārāyana, Ananta, and Nộsimha. Vide M. M. Chakravarti's remarks on the temple in JASB for 1912 (vol. 87 at pp. 338-39 for a description of the temple which is in good condition even after eight centuries ). He also gave to Harimedhas female attendants, dug a tank and laid out a garden. Neither Kielhorn nor Chakravarti has attempted any explanation of the epithet Bāla valabhībhujanga. I hazard an explanation. Bhavadeva probably made some innovation in the structure of the roofs or balconies of the temples he built and he was therefore styled a lover ( a gallant or para mour ) of little bálu-small-sized or girlish ) valabhīs. From the nature of the character Kielhorn conjectured that the inscription belonged to the 12th century A. D. 
The epithet. Bāla valabhi-bhujanga 'has mystified several writers. In 'Modern Review' for March 1931, at p. 288 Mr. Ray suggests that it means 'destroyer of the kingdom of Bālavalabhi in Rādha'. In I. H. Q. vol. 27 p. 80 Dr. D. C. Sircar quotes verse 23 of the Tautātitamatatilaka879 (quoted below ) and holds that the appellation was given to Bhava deva in his student days. Another possible explanation is as

Dr. Sircar quotes from a fragmentary ms. of Tautālita-matatiluka. verso 23, as follows : मामध्ययनदशायामुवाच वाचं दर्शि स्वप्नं (1)। बालवलभीभुजङ्गापरनामा त्वमसि भवदेव । तेनायमुद्यमो मे विद्यादान्न जातु सञ्जातः । तस्मादिहावधानं विधातुमाधकुर्वते सुधियः ॥ 
Vide I. H. Q. Vol. 27 pp. 80-82. Dr. Dasharatha Sharma yives a reply to this in the same rolume on p. 339, which does not appear to me to be at all sitisfactory. Vido also I, H, Q. vol. 29 p. 294 where Dr Sircar repoats what he says TI1Q, Vol. 27. No reason is assigned why a student should be dubbed bhuians of valabbi' by buy teacher. The words in boll type are more or lesg inexplicable. It is not know who spoke ' uvāca'), unless ve

follows:- The word 'bhujanga' according to a kośa quoted by Ksirasvámin on Amarasimha means 'vesyắpati’ ( one who visits prostitutes ) and therefore in an extended sense * gallant' or a lewd person. We have a classical and comparatively early use of that word in the Harsacarita of Bāna ( in 2nd Ucchvāsa in the paragraph just before the last ). When Bana was presented to the Einperor Harşa, the latter turned to the Mālava prince sitting behind him ( Harsa ) and remarked this is a great bhujanga' ( mabān-ayam bhujangah). Bāna protests "what bave I done to be dubbed a bhujanga” (Kā me bhujangatā; it may also mean there is lewdness in Kāma i. e. Cupid and not in me). He further protests that he was a brāhmana born in the family of Vātsyāyanas that performed Soma sacrifices, that he had by heart the Veda with the six subsidiary lores, that he studied the Sastras, he admits that he was guilty of some trifling follies in his youth but they were not such as to be censured in this world and as would prevent his attaining heaven; he repents of those follies; common people spread strange rumours, but great men should see things as they really are. Harsa probably did not mean more than this that he ( Bāna ) had sowa his wild oats. Therefore, Bālavalabhībhujanga would mean one who had sown wild oats in Bālavalabhi, a village or town in Rādhā (not identifiable now). Valabhi was a famous town in Kathiawad in the 5th and 6th centuries A. D. In Indian Culture' vol. for 1939 pp. 467 ff it is pointed out that over 85 Inscriptions of the Maitrakas of Valabhi bad been published till then. The Bhattikāvya was composed in

take 'Sarasvati' ( occurring in the first verse ) as the subject. We mar then understand that the author professes ( or brags ) that Saragrati spoke to him in a dream. But how is darśi'to be con strued? Is it a verbal form or a poun? Another difficulty is : what in the metre of the verse ? The first half has 17 letters, while the latter half has 19 letters. If it is a muitra metro, what is the metro? If we could read it fr the metre would be right ag an 'Arya'. Unless one can secure several mss, it is not possible to argue that somebody gurprised by the peculiar appellation might have invented some story and inserted a verse or verses in the fragment. A ms, of the Tautitita-matitilaka way described in the Catalogue of the Sanskrit ings, in the India Office Library prepared by Dr. Windisch and Dr. Epuoling, part IV p. 690, No. 2166. It deals only with pūdu l of chapter II of the Pūrvamimanıgāsūtra.

Valabbi ruled over by Dharasena. Dr. S. K. De in History of Sanskrit Literature' Vol. I ( Calcutta University 1947) p. 717 shows that there was an ancient village called Vĩddha Valabhi and Bhavadeva's residential village was called Bāla valabhī to distinguish it from the other village'. And as the word Bälavalabhī-bhujanga occurs in an official document (in E. I. Vol. VI pp. 203-207) and is applied to Bhavadeva who had become a minister of king Harivarma of Bengal that flourished about the last quarter of the 11th or the first quarter of the 12th century A. D., we would have to take it in a secondary sense. It may be pointed out that Visvanā tha-kavirāja, author of the Sahityadarpana on Sanskrit Poetics (14th century A. D.) quotes ( in 2nd Pariccheda a verse 'Durgālanghitavigrahah... rājatyumāvallabhaḥ' composed by his father, a great poet and a minister for peace and war and describes him as 'mama tātapādānām Mahapatra Caturdašu-bhāṣā-vilásinī-bhujangama-mahākavīśvara-sri Candrasekhara-sāndhivigrahikānām'. 
Besides the ancient and well-known Dharmasūtras and smộtis (such as those of Gautama, Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Vasistha, Visuu, Manu, Yājñavalkya, Devala, Nārada, Bșha spati, Kätyāyana and others, he quotes in the Prāyaścitta prakarana the following authors, and works : Caturvimśati mata p. 53; Jikana (or Jikana p. 102, Viśvarūpa, Dhāreśvara and Srīkara ( all three on p. 82 ) Bălaka (pp. 42, 44, 74, 81, 83, 109), Yogiyājña valkya (p. 38 quotes Yogiyājňavalkya 8. 2.), Srikara ( pp. 9, 82, 105 Șat-trimālāšan 9 times ). 
Recently Bhavadevabhatta's Sava-sūtikāśauca-prakarana' has been edited by Dr. R. C. Hazra and published in the Govt. Sanskrit College Research Series of Calcutta. Some informa tion about it was given in I. H. Q. vol. 32 pp. 1-14 by Dr. Hazra bimself, which has been embodied in the exhaustive Intro. to it. His edition is based on three mss. recently found in Assam written in old Assamese script. One of them is dated śuke 1705 (1783 A. D.). The other two have the same appearance and present the same condition (Intro. V). The concluding verse speaks of the author as Bhatta Sribha Vadeva and the editor gives up the reading of the second half of the verse in the three mss. and substitutes what he thinks to be the proper reading. This reverses the usual procedure

History of Dharmaśāstra 
followed in scholarly editions based on mss. He should bave kept the reading supported by all his m88. as the text and added a footnote stating what he thought should be the reading. On p. XXIII of the Intro. he himself admits "we have given ( the title ) as 'Savasūta kāśauca-prakarana', altho ugh all the three mss, hare it as 'savasūtika-visuddhi-pra karan' in the concluding verse and as 'Savasūtikāśauca-pra karana' in the colophons. Further comment is unnecessary. He has given up here his role as editor. The reading present ed by the mss. is quite good. It would mean literally' a trea tise on the purification in cases of an impurity of a dead body (i. € on death ) and of a sütikī. Sütikā means a woman that has had a recent delivery (may be prematurely or after the full period of gestation ). The Amarakośa says : Aristam Sütikā gặham. The word Sūtaka is used in three senses viz. (1) In Manu V. 58 and Yāj. III. 18-19 the word 'sūtaka' is used in the sense of impurity on birth'; (2) impurity on both birth and death as in Gobhilasmrti III. 60 and 63 ;(3) Impurity on death alone as in Dakşasmrti VI. 1 and Gobhilasmrti III. 48. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 268-269 on Āśauca, Jananāsauca or sūtaka and sāvāśauca and the notes below. In Ait. B. 32.8 the word 'Sutakānna’ is probably used in both senses of sūtaka. Prof. Hazra unnecessarily and without any authority changes the name of the work and creates unnecessary con fusion. In the note on p. XXIII of the Introduction he remarks. I have not been able to find out a single instance of the use of the word 'Sütikā'in the sense of Sūtakā' (meaning birth ). Nobody asks him to take 'sūtikă' in the sense of birth. He has on his own authority put down the name as' savasūta kāśauca -prakarana' which may be split up in two parts viz. 'Sava-āśauca-prakarana' and 'sūtaka-āśa ucaprakarana'. The dead body has to observe no āśauca; 
Savāśaucaprakarana' therefore has to be taken to mean ( by laksana' impurity ( for living persons ) in relation to a dead body (in the house or family ) i. e. ăśauca arising on deatb. Similarly, 'sūtakāśauca-jirakarana' would have to be taken to mean treatise concerning the observance of impurity in relation to a sūtaka', which as shown above, has different meanings. Therefore, the reading 'Sava-sutikā-visuddhi prakarana ' must be accepted as the proper reading. It is a far 
14. Bhavadevabhatta, 
649 
better reading since it prominently and expressly mentions purification on two occasions, while, if we read 'āśauca' only, the impurity is emphasized, the purification being left to be understood. And further there is the support for this read ing in all available mss. 
Prof. Hazra, in his Intro. to the work 'sava-prakarana' on p. XVIII (last two lines ) first construes · Bālavalabhi bhujanga as meaning 'a serpent (i. e. i dangerous and invin cible scholar ) of Bälavalabhi (a place). This is overdrawn. We can accept' dangerous scholar) as the suggested meaning but 'invincible’ is entirely different. A serpent is not at all invincible. Eagles and kites swoop down on it and kill it. In the woodel parts of the Konkan the present author has seen large serpents 'silled with the single stroke of a thick bamboo stick. Prof. Hazra (probably not being satisfied with his first explanation ) suggests another fantastic explanation (on p. XX of the Introiluction ) of the epithet. He breaks it up into four component parts viz. bāla ( young learners ), bala i for ' vala') meaning 'hosts', 'bhi' (fear ) anil 'bhujanga' ( serpent), all taken together as meaning' who is a serpent to the fear of hosts of young learners 'as reparıls the works and subjects which are difficult to understanel'. Those who like this may accept it. The present author holds that this is a far-fetched, unacceptable and worthless explanation from several points of view.

No cremation of the body of a child less than two years of age ; āśauca ( period of) when a chill dies after Upa nayana ; Āścucu for Ksatriyas, Vaiśyas and Sülras on the death of a Supindu whose upandyanu hail been performed de pends on his gunas ; āšruck in the case of dāsas and disis ; days of āśauca on the death of a brāhmaṇa who was an Agni hotrin or not so: discussion about the time for purification of a śūdra ; the proper time of collecting the ashes of a pierson cre mated depending for its length on possessing good qualities or not so possessing ; āśauca on the death of daughters not agreed or agreed to be given in marriage or married or un married; three days cśrcucc for married women on the death of their parents or for ten days before they are married; āśauca on the death of a son born to a brāhmana from a wile of a lower varna; āśauce on the death of a samanodakı ; cases of aśauca for a puksiņi (i. e. period of two days having a night between the two); āśauca (period of) on the death of one's ācārya (as defined by Manu II. 140 ) or of his sons or wife or of the king (being a ksatriya ) in whose realm one dwells ; cases of sadyaḥśauca (purification immediately after taking a bath ) as laid down in Yājňavalkya III. 28-29, Gautama Dh. S. 14, 41-42, Parāśara 3. 202 ); purification on carrying the dead body of one who was not a spindu or following the funeral procession of one dead, whether a relative or not (Manu V. 101, 103); dead body to be taken through the eastern, nor thern, western or southern gates of the city according to the varna of the deceased ( Manu V. 92); rules about Schuh gamand of a wife and anugamna ; rules about impurity on birth for sapindas follows the same principles as on death (Manu V. 61 ), the impurity on death affects all sa pindas but the impurity on birth affects the parents alone and the impurity on birth affects seriously only the mother, while the father becomes pure after a bath ( Manu V. 62 ). If, while one period of impurity (on death or birth ) is running as regards a person, another āśauca of the same kind supervenes, he becomes pure after the end of the prior āśauca (Manu V. 79). If one kind of āśauca becomes mixed up with another kind of āśauca that sets in, the rules are rather complicated.74. Bhavadevabhattu

Many ancient sayes are quoted. Manu, Yājñavalkyar Gautama and Parāśara are profusely quoted for such a smal! work. Another striking feature is that nine sages are quotete Hes with the word brlost prefixed to their names (viz. Angiras Bphaspati, Manu, Yama, Yājīja valkya, Visnu, Vyāsa, Sankha and Hārita ). It may be noted that only two purāņas are cited viz. Matsya (2 verses on p. +1 ) and Vişnn (one verse on p. 31). 
The date of Bhavadeva can be approximately settled to be about 1100 A. D. as he is quoted by Hemădri, the Vivādacan dra of Misaru and the Smrtísāra of Harinātha. He is certain ly earlier than 1200 A, D. A period of at least half a century must have elapsed before a Bengal writer like Bhavadevil came to be looked upon as an authority on mimāmsā by Hemādri who wrote in distant Berar. It appears that he was quoted in the Karmopadesini of Aniruddha (1. O. cat. No. 1853. P. 47+). But that Ms. is bound up with another work by id later author and the reference in the cat, is not quite clear. If we rely on the Vira mitrodaya, a work called Pradīsia criticised the views of Bhavadeva on the verse of Yäj. II. 24 ( about adverse possession for 20 and 10 years ). Bhava deva helt that twenty years' enjoyment of immovable pro perty by a stranger implied that the real owner meant to abandon it for the benefit of the stranger enjoying it, that such abandonment for the enjoyment of another leads to the inference of the extinction of previous ownership and that the property being abandoned by the owner in favour of the stranger who takes hold of it, ownership also (of the stranger) arises. The Pradija i points out that it does not invariably

follow that, because a stranger is allowed to enjoy land, the owner intends to abandon the land for the stranger, nor is it an invariable rule that what is abandoned for another becomes the property of that other. It will be showu later on that the Pradīpa must have been composed before 1150 A. D. Hence it follows that Bhavadeva flourished about 1100 A. D. He cannot be very much earlier than that, as he is not mentioned by any writer of the 19th century and as he not only mentions Kumă rila and Prabhākara, but also Viśvarújia and Dhāreśvara. 
There were several other later persons named Bhavadeva who wrote on topics of Dharmaśāstra such as Bhavadeva author of Dānadharmaprakrivi (middle of 17th century), and Bhavadeva, the author of Smộticaudrika, who flourished in the first half of the 18th century. 
On Bhavadeva's Karmānusthana-paddhati there is a com mentary called Samsārapaudhatirahasya.

75. Prakasa The Vivādaratnākara of Candleśvara cites the views of Prakāśa scores of times ( e. g. pp. 131, 145, 456, 460,462, 474, 485, 504 etc.). Frequently Prakása is coupled with Pārijāta (vide Vivādaratnākara Pp. 145, 2+1, 260, 286, 456 ). On p. 602 of the V. R. the two ( Prakása and Pārijāta ) are cited as differing from each other. On pp. 286 and 465 of the V. R., Prakāśa, Pārijāta and Haláyulla are cited together as hold ing the same view. It would be shown under Kalpataru' that a work called Maharnava' is mentioned in verses 12 and 13 of the Introiluction to the Brahmacãrikända and that the same work is cited in citierent ways as Smrtimahārnava or Mahárnava-prakāśa' or simply as Mahârnava' or as 'Prakāśa' (e. g. p. 497 ). Onfraye 518 of the livadaratnākara a remark of Prakāśa wherein both Asahiya and Hedhātithi are named

These quotations establish that Prakāśa was a work that not only dealt with vyavahāra, but also with such topics as diints, sriddle etc. 
Whether the Prakāśa was an independent work or a com mentary is somewhat doubtful. But from a passage of the Vivādaratnākara it seems to follow that it was a commentary on the Yajia valkyasmrti. There we are told that the Kalpa taru$85 read abhijanatä' for 'a vijanatä' iu Yaj. II. 258, but that since that reading is opposed to Yūjnavalkya-prakāśa, Halāyudha and Pārijata it must be recarded as a wrong read ing. As it is a realiny of Yaj. himself that was being dis cussed, it would be somewhat stranye if it were said that it was opposed to Yiij. and Prakirýil anil therefore it is necessary to suppose that Yajia valkyaprakieśa is one work. 
The Vivādacintāmani in several places gives the explana tion of Prakāśa.886 The Smrtisara 87 yives at great length the

explanation of Prakāśa on the controversial verses of Yāj. (II. 138-139). The Viramitrodaya*** quotes at length Prakāśa's explanation of Manu ( 9. 207 ) and disapproves of it on the ground ( among others ) that the verse can more clearly be explained so as to convey a meaning similar to that of Yāj. II. 116. The Prakāśa is mentioned in the Dayatattva ( vol. II, 1. 173) and in the Suddhitattva ( Vol. II, p. 288)and p. 385 and the Mahārnava-prakāśa is mentioned in the Kaljataru on Srāddha p. 262. 
As the Prakāśa is quoted in the Kalpataru it is certainly earlier than 1125. A. D. It mentions Medhatithi. Besides the Mit. does not refer to it. There is room for thinking that it follows the Mit. Yaj. II. 116 is, according to the livida ratnākära, '59 explained by the Prakāśa in almost the same words as the Mit. It is possible that both borrow from the same original. At all events the Prakāģa must have been composed between 1000 and 1100 A. D. 
Hemālri frequently cites a work called Mahārnava prakāśa.890 According to the latter the sandal unguents, flowers, incense, lamp presented in śräddha are to be offered to the Brälunanas invited and not to the intr's.

Hemādri refers to a work called Smrtimahārnava or simply Mahārnava.892 It appears to me that all these are the names of the same work. The Madanapārijāta (p. 93 ) quotes a verse from the Smrtimahārnava about upåkarmn. 
76. Parijāta 
Several works bear the appellation Pārijāta such as the Vidhānapārijāta ( composed in 1625 A. D. ), the Madanapări. jāta ( about 1375 A. 1).) and the Prayogapārijāta ( between 1400-1500 ). But there was an ancient work called Pārijāta quoted by even some of the earliest nibuni hakāries. The Vivādaratnākara regarded the Kaljataru, Parijata Halā yudha and Prakāśa as its most eminent predecessors.893 The Dānaratnākara 90+ quotes several times the views of Pārijāta on gifts. The Smộtisára of Harinātha sets out at length tbe order of succession to a sonless inan according to the Pārijāta (vide I, O. Ms. No. 301, folio 134 a ). One of the striking opinions of the Pārijāta was that the widow of a sonless man should raise offspring by niyoga and give the wealth of the deceased to the son so born. 
From the above it appears that the Pārijāta was an in dependent work on 16'hora, dūnu and other topics, as it held vieirs similar to those of Bhojadeva and Halāyudba on the widow's rights and as it is not quoted by the Mit, or other earlier works it must be assigned to a date between 1000-1125 A. D. In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 348 at p. 356 the learneri judges hold that the Părijāta frequently citel as an authority by the Vivādaratnākara is the Madanapărijāta. But this is entirely wrong. The latter work, it will be shown ( viile sec.

The Krtyaratnākara meutions the Pārijāta pine times ( on pp. 31. 54, 58, 59, 61, 66, 74, 92, 606 ) and Vivādaratnākara quotes it six times. The Pārijāta was liberal enough to state that the Pāñcarătra, Pāśupata and similar doctrines, where not opposed to the Veda, are authoritative as to those parts (Krtyaratnākara p. 31 ).

Sastri in the Cat. of Mss. of the Govt. in the custody of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (vol. III, p'p. 51-54 No. 1924 ) gives a description of the Ms. of the Smrtimanjarī on Acāra and Prāyaścitta. 
Manu IV. 212 requires a brāhmana to desist from parta king of food of various categories, one of which is food offered by an ugra. Both Janu ( X. 9 ) and Yāj. (I. 92) provide that the son of a Ksatriya from a wife of the Sūdra class is called Ugra. The Kalpataru (on Niyata-kāla-kõnda p. 261 ) quotes the author of the Manjarī, paraphrasing 'uyra' as meaning 
rājan'. The Srāddhakalpataru on p. 46 mentions Manjari kāra' and on p. 259 Smrtimanjarīkāra'. The same work is meant in both places. The Srāddhakānda (Kalpataru ) pp. 46-47 ) quotes a long passage from the Vāyupurāna stating that some kind of edible grains, vegetables, and other articles should be offered in Srāddha. One of these is Kāleya, which is explained by Govindarāja. On Manu III. 285, Govinda rāja's gloss is not accepted by Kullūka, while on Manu II]. 178 Kullūka agrees with both Medhătithi and Govindarăja. 
Raghunandana in Dāyatattva (vol. II, p. 191 ) quotes a verse of Visņu cited by Govindarāja. 
The Dāyabhāga of Jimūtavāhana (XI ) quotes Govinda rāja as holding on the strength of a verse of Visuus97a that a daughter's son succeeded to the estate of a deceased person even before the married daughter of the deceased. Iu the printed com. of Govindarāja, there is no comment of his after Manu IX. 72. But it appears that Jimātavāhana had before him the com. of Govindarāja on the verses after IX. 72 (at least on what are Manu IX. 131-136 ). Govindarāja is men tioned in the Kalaviveka (p. 304 ) and Vyavahāramātrkā (p. 342 ) also.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Kullūka differs expressly from Govindarāja on Manu I. 5, I. 82 ( Itaresvāgamat); II. 122, 125, 127; III. 50, 53, 127, 129, 191, 221, 284, 285%; V. 16, 51, 72, 84, 104 ( imam Govinda rājasya răjājñām nādriyāmahe ); VI. 14, 79, 84 &c. In dozens of cases ( besides these ) Govindaraja's views are mentioned but not criticized by Kullūka. 
From these two works a brief account of the personal his tory of Govindarāja can be extracted. The colophons at the end of the Manutikā describe Govindarāja as the son of bhatta Madhava. The first verse:98 of the Smrtimanjari and one at the end ( though somewhat corrupt ) give the information that he was the son of Madhava and grand-son of Nārāyana and appears to have lived on the holy banks of the Ganges.898 Those who like Sarvadhikari identify Govindarāja with Govindacandra, prince of Benares, are therefore entirely wrong since he was a Brāhmaṇa and not a Ksatriya. The first verse900 of his Manuțīkā contains an obeisance to god (or Siva ) and states that he had received the śāstra of Manu in an unbroken tradition of teacher and pupil and that he had examined previous commentaries of Manu. 
The Smrtis mentioned by him in the two works of his are given below.901 Besides, he mentions the Vayupurana (on Manu III. 232 ) and Purāņa in general (on Manu I. 74 and 80). He frequently quotes the Grhyasutras, also the Bahvr. cagrhyaparisista, the Yogasātra. He says ( on Manu 2. 23)

that Mleccha countries like Andhra and others were not fit for performing sacrifices. He appears to have held like Medbā. tithi the view that moksa was to be attained by a combina tion of jñāna and karmaso? As compared with the bhāsya of Medhātithi his commentary is very concise. Kullūka largely drew upon Medbātithi and Govindarāja, mentions them hundreds of times, criticizes'03 both of them and particularly holds up Govindarāja to ridicule often enough.903a Kullūka notes that Govindarāja in opposition to Medhātithi and Bhoja deva arranged Manu 8. 181-184 differently (putting 8. 182 as the last of those four verses ). In the printed edition there is no comment of Govindarāja on the verses of the 9th chapter from verse 72. But it appears that the Dāyabhäga had that part of the commentary, as it quotes the views of Govinda rāja on the rights of the daughter's son which could have appeared only on Manu IX. 130-136. 
A few words may now be said about the Smrtimañjari mss. which are rare. At the end of the India Office Ms. a summary of the contents of the whole work is given ( for which see footnote below ).904. It appears that the Smrtimafi

ari dealt with all principal topics of dharmaśāstra such as the saņskāras, the daily duties viz: bath, samdhyā, brahma yajsia, the duties of the student, householder, the forest hermit, and the swimyosin, the duties of the four varnas; gifts, the purifications of various materials, foods forbidden and allow ed, impurity on birth and death, sapindles and samānodakas, funeral rites, srāddha and its various details, and Präyaścitta. The ms. in the India office deals with the adhikari for priyas citta, the parşat (i. e. the assembly of learned men who are to determine what prāyaścitta is to be prescribed ), the means of atoping for sins and violations of religious duties, the prāyas cittas for the muuhapătukes i viz. the inurder of a Brāhmana, drinking wine, theft of gold, incest. Paul for other lesser and similar sins, meaning of the word prāyaścitta, prāyaścittas for killing men of Ksatriya, Vaisya anl Sudra classes and for killing women, prāyaścittas for the killing of a cow and of various beasts and birds, prāyaścittas for eating forbidden or polluted food and for selling articles forbidden to be sold, secret prayascittas. The India Office Ms. which deals only with priyascittas contains 152 folios. This gives us an idea as to how extensive the whole work must have been embrac ing as it did the entire field of dharmaśāstra.

Kullūka ( vide note 773 above ) expressly says that Medhātithi is much earlier than Govindaraja. Though Medhātithi is nowhere ex pressly named in his commentary by Govindaraja 07 the latter appears to have several times criticised Medhatithi. Another

History of Dharmaśīstra 
important circumstance is that, though the Mit. mentions Medbātithi and Bhojadera as great authorities it is silent about Govindarāja. Hence it follows that Govindarāja could not have flourished earlier than Bhojadeva, i. e. earlier than about 1050 A. D. In the Hāralată of Aniruddha ( which as we shall see later on (must have been composed about 1160 A. D. ), Govindarāja is quoted several times and is looked upon as a great authority like Viśvarūpa, Bhojadeva and Kamadhenu.908 This shows that Govindaraja could not have flourished later than 1125 A. D. The Dayabhāga909 (in Duhiträelhikúra ) disapproves of the view of Govindarāja who placed the daughter's son before married daughter as an heir. In his Kāla virekao10 also Jimūtavāhana refers to Govindarāja in the same breath with Bhojarāja and Visvarūpa. In his Vyavahāramātrkā$11 he refers to Maîjarīkāra as having held the same view as Visvarīpa. Manjarī here must be taken to be the Smrtimanjarī of Govindarāja, since Jimūtavāhana in his other works refers to Govindaraja, since Kullūka also speaks of the Manjarī of Govindarāja ( vide note 706 above ) and since there is no other known ancient work of that name on dharmaśāstra. This shows that the Maŭjari comprised a discussion on vyuvuhūra, also. Hemādri912 tells that the author of the work called Panditaparitosa refuted the views of Govindarāja on the performance of śrāddba on the 13th tithi by a man having a son. This shows that Govindarāja must have preceded Hemādri ( who wrote in the latter half of the 13th century or by at least a century more. The

Smrtyarthasārao13 of Sridhara relies on the views of Govindarāja in its section on samnyāsa. 
When the first edition of H. of Dh. ( Vol. I ) was publish ed in 1930, no portion of the Krtyakalpataru of Laksmīdhara was available in print. Later, eleven kāndas of the Kalpataru have been edited by Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar and published and some part of the Prayascittakānda has been discovered by Dr. S. L. Katre and he has published a paper in 'Bharatiya Vidyā' Vol. 17 (1957) pp. 72-75, in which he points out in all six passages referring to Govindarāja and Smộtimanjarī, once in the Prāyaścittakānda, twice as Mañjarīkāra and Smrtimañjarīkāra in the Niyata kālakānda p. 261 ('Ugro räjeti Maîjarikāral’) ou Manu IV. 212 (ugrannam ) and on p. 280 of the same kanda he quotes from the Smrti-Manjari three hemistichs cited on the word 
parārīka' (as a variety of palandu ) from Ayurveda. Dr. Katre mentions three more passages from the Srāddha--kāụda (pp. 45.46, 46-47 about Bhārunda''Kāleya' from Mañjarī kåra and Govindarāja and from pp. 258–59, where Smrtiman jarikāra is quoted. 
There is no doubt now that the Kalpataru quotes from the Smộtimañjari of Govindarīja and that the latter's literary activity cannot be placed later than about 1110 A. D. and that he should be assigned to the period 1000-1110 A. D. ( since he mentions Dhāreśvara Bhojarāja and is mentioned in the Kalpataru and the Dayabhāga ). 
78 The Kalpataru of Laksmidhara The Krtyakalpataru or Kalpataru of Laksmidliara exer cised great influence over the Dharmaśāstra writers of Mithila, Bevgal and Northern India in general. It was an extensive work divided into fourteen kändas. For the first volume of the H. of Dh. published in 1930 the author could secure mss. of only three kändas viz. Dána, Rājadharma and Vyavahára. On reading the account of the Kalpataru in H. of Dh. Vol. I. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar saw the present author and asked him whether he ( the present author ) would under take to edit the work. The present author stated that his

hands were full owing to the work to be done on the other volumes of the H. of Dh, and that the Professor might under take the bringing out of an edition of the Kalpataru if he liked. Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar undertook the heavy task and edited in the Gaikwall's Oriental Series (Baroda ) eleven Kändas ( out of the fourteen kāndas of the Kalpataru ) and left three parts unedited when he passed away; but the present author learns that one part on Pratisthā may be published soon. Laksmidhara himself refers to the work as Kalpavřkşa and Kalparlruma also ( in verses 10 and 13 of the Introd. of the Br. K.) and later writers anul works also sometimes employ the synonyms (e. g. the Vivādaratnākara at the end refers to Kalpavrksa in a paronomastic verse ). Prof. Aiyangar pub lished the Dänakamili as the first instalment of the whole work in 1941 with a lengthy Introduction of 129 pages. On p. 18 of the Intro. to Dánakānda, Prof. Aiyangar set out what he then (in 1941 ) supposed to be the names of the fourteen kāndas viz. I. Bralımacāri-kana (published in 1948); II.

VI. On Vrata (pub. in 1953 ). This kunda is principally based on Purānas, eleven in number, among which Bhavisya, Matsya and Varāha are the most prominent. On p. 2 it states that in the Krta, Tretī, Drādara and Kali Yugas respectively Sujayi, Randi, Dhananjay, Vikrami ittained the position of supreme rulers (sirrablauna ) by performing vratas and that Vasundhar, the virtuous laughter of Vikrama dwelling in the Daśārna country i lalva) secureil inoksi, by performing vratas.

Mandāra, Sālagrama, Stutasvāmin, Dvărakı Lohārgala, Kedāra, Naimisa, and others. Besides, this kānda speaks of the starting on the Mahāpatha (the great journey ) referred to in Manu VI. 31, the Mahābhārata in its Maháprasthā nikaparva ( declaring that Yudhisthira with his four brothers queen Draupadi and a faithful dog started on the Great Journey towards Himālaya and that they fell down dead one after another, Draupadi being the first and Bhima the last. Volume IV of H. of Dh. Section IV (pp. 552-727 ) contains descriptions of several famous holy places and several hundred tirthas are mentioned together with references to the Epics, Purānas and other works ( in pp. 730-825), where less known tirthas like Lohārgala, Stutas vāmin are mentioned. The Tirthakalpataru bases its treatment on the Mahābhārata ( quoted 15 times ), 12 Purānas Matsya and Varāha being quoted 11 times each ). Vide Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya's paper in N. I. A. Poona Vol. IX. (1947) pp. 100-104 on “Vāca spati-miśra's indebtedness to Lakşmīdharabhatta ”. 
IX. (probably dealt with Prāyaścittas). That Laksmi dhara desired to devote one kända to Prāyaścittas is clear from his own statement in the Grhasthakānda p. 314 (nara kāus-etc. Práyascittakānde vaksyāmaḥ). Besides, the Prāyas. cittatattva of Raghunandana quotes several verses of Yama on the Gomatividyā from Prāyaścitta Kalpataru (p. 522–23 ). Vide A. of Dh. Vol. IV p. 108 where the whole passage from Yama on Gomati-vidyā has been quoted. Dr. S. L. Katre con tributed a paper on the Prāyaścittakānda, missing section of the Kalpataru' to the J. O. I. ( Baroda ) Vol. VIII (part 3 pp. 286-290. On p. 289 he describes a moth-eaten ms. of Prayas cittakānda from Benares, furnishes a summary of the contents from 72 available folios of the ms. containing more than 104 folios and he surinises that Pratisthā is a supplement of Pūjā. Dr. Katre sets out the different ( 32 ) topics dealt with in the ms. he describes (pp. 289-290 ) and names the authors and works relied on (p. 290 ). It is possible to argue that Pūjā ( worship) follows after Pratisthā and that therefore the 7th Kända might have been called Pratisthā and also included dis quisitions ou Pūjā. 
X. Suddhi-kānda (pub. in 1950). This is the smallest of the eleven kändas so far published.

78. The Kalpataru of Lakşmidhura 
667 
The Mitāksarā deals with āśauca on Yáj. III. 1-34. This subject also is dealt with in the Suddhikānda of the Kalpa taru. Many of Yājñavalkya's verses (III. 1-34 ) have been quoted in the Suddhikânda but in many cases without any comment whatever. Verses of this last type are Yāj. III. 1-2 (q. on p. 72 of $.), 3-5 (9. on .85), 7-11 (9. on p. 91 ), 12–13 q. on p. 98 and p. 58 ), 24 (2. on p. 53 ), 25 (q. on p. 54 ), 26 (q. on p. 70), 28-29 (q. on p. 64), 31-34 69. on pp. 115 -- 116 ). On· Yamasúktam' mentioned in Yāj. III. 2; the Mit. points, out that it is the hymn beginning with 'Pareyi vāmśam' (Rg. X. 14. 1-16 ), but the Suddhikānda does not refer to it on p. 72. On some of the verses the comment of the Mit. extends to some pages e. g. on III. 1-2 it is two closely printed pages, on III, 2+ over two pages, on III. 28-29 ( two pages ). On Yāj. III. 15 ( śuddhi-kāuda p. 90 ),916 the only explanation offered is that the word 'kațānnam' means 'āśāucānnam' while the Mit. has five lines of explana tion on the verse and explains the word 'sakatānnam' as kațaśabdenāśaucam laksyate tat sahacaritam-annam sakață pnam (i. e. it takes 'sakatan nain as one compound ), while it seems that L. separated as 'sa kațānnam'. On III. 22 the Mit has a comment of th of a printed page, wbile L. explains only the words 'sūdrasya tadardham nyāyavartinah' as ' pākayajña-dvijaśuśrūsādi-ratasya tadardham syāt'. These very words are used by the Mit. in its long comment. On Yāj. III. 30 quoted by L. (on Suddhikānda p. 126 ) the Mit. has a lengthy discussion of more than two printed pages, while L. in Suudikānda (p. 126 ) sets out only two lines and a half of explanation almost in the same words (though not clear as the quotations below will show ).917 The present

78. The Kulpaturu of Lakşmīdhura 
669 
XI. Rāja«lharmakanda ( pub. in 1943). This is one of the smallest and the weakest sections of the Kalpataru and by its meagre and pedestrian contents offers an anti-climax to the great claims ma'le by Liksmidhara in the Introductory verse of this kinda which says. In this 11th kända Laksmī dhara describes the collection of Rajadharmas, Laksmidhara whose inind is i beint ) on meritorious actions and to whose wonderful greatness in political wisdom are due, all such results is the placing of the world on the path of right, as the fact that elephants are found attached to the houses of those endowed with good qualities and the fact that king, Govinda candra planted his feet on the heads of kings. Even Prof. Rangacharyi, the elitor, who every now and then sings the praises of Liksmihara, Wits constrained to observe in his lengthy Introduction ( 9.5 pages) 'to a modern student of ancient Indian polity it will also appear somewhat barren and theoretical when compared with, for ex: tn {·le, the Kautilīya ( 19 ) and the great expectations raised by these features may not be inet by a stuly of this bouk ( 111 ). The text printed in very large type occupies only 176 payes (exclud ing the Demyttori-uadhi, anl festivals ) and if smaller type had been used (as in the Vir. Edition of the Mită ksară ) it would have probably occupied not inore than 70 pages ( of the Vir.elition type )and at least lesser space than 95 pages devoted to the Introduction. The topics discussed are: praise of the kingly office, kiny's coronation, the qualities requisite in a king, ministers, forts ( incluiling the capital ), construction of palace (and other matters, ilag ic), a mini stration of the State, Royal treasury (and revenue ), Danda i. e. royal furces (described in three verses and two lines ), mitret ( 1. e. illy ) in it little over two pages; Rājaputraraksā i. e. yuariling and education of the prince ( in nine verses from Matsya;jurilita ane two from Malabharata with two lines of explauation), Robitro (consultation with ministers) for settling policies, Şarlyunya ( six lines of policy, namely making peace, decision to go to war, Yina, isuna, Dvaidhībhava and Samśra ya ; ( only verses of Manu VII 160-180 and IX. 298-300 are quotel withont a word of comment by himself or taken from predecessors; Yātril( invasion against an enemy, pp. 115–143); many works quoted without hardly any exulanation by Laksmidhara and the elition alldings mostly passages from Viramitrodaya and a few from Haradatta and others; abhi şiktahrtyáni ( what the crowned king should do from day to 
670 
History of Dharmasüstra 
day); in pp. 178-212 are described festivals to be undertaken and celebrated by the king (such as Devayātrā in all the days of Vaišākba quoting a long passage from Brabma purāņa on pp. 178-181 with only one line of his own comment; Kaumudimahotsava ( pp. 182-3) and the festival of raising the flag in honour of Indra ( pp. 181-190) from Devīpurāsa.918 Each page can contain only 11 or 12 verses, if there be no foot-notes ( as on p. 74 ), but as almost every page has foot notes about variant readings and also contains extracts from the Vīramitrodaya, Kullūka, Maskaribhāsya and other works; in some cases as much as half a page is occupied by notes. Taking the above facts into consideration, the high claims made for his excellent policies and eliminating the extract on festivals, what remains of Rājadharma in this kānda is meagre and does little credit to the learuing and experience of a great adıninistrator, minister and cominander. 
The festivals dealt with are : 
Mahānavamīpūjā on Āśvina bright ball, 9th tithi, (pp. 191-195 from Devipurāna without a word of comment); Ciphavidhi ( in Kārtika ) in honour of Devī from Devipurāna in pp. 196-198; Gavotsarga (in pp. 199–200, from Devipurāņa); Vasor-dhāră ( pp. 201-212 from Bhavisyapurāņa ). 
This Kānda was published at Lahore in 1942 by Mr. Jagadish Lal also. 
All the topics dealt with in this Kāuda except Rājapra śasti, Abhiseka ( pp. 9-17 ), Vāstukarmavidhi (pp. 55-78 ), Rāja putrābhiraksā ( 2 pages ) are specified by Yāj. (in I. 309–78 ) and the Mit. It may be noted that the Mit. avoids quotiny Purana passages on Rājadbarma, while L. quotes Puranas profusely, viz. Matsya ( about 285 verses ), Devi (190 verses ), Brahmapurana (81 verses ). He quotes only

about 84 verses from the Mahābhārata in this Kānda (when the Säntiparva alone devotes over 100 adhyāyas to Raja dharma ), quotes about 76 verses from other Purăņas (in all about 726 verses from the Purānas and Mahābhārata ). 
XII. Vyavahārakānda ( pub. in 1953 ).919 The first verse states " Laksmidhara dilates in the 12th Kānda on the subject of Vyavahāra ( Law and Administration of justice ), Laksmī. dhara, on listening to whose various learned words clarifying the ways of vyavuhāra in such matters as doing justice, esta blished by the force of his intellect clever in considering the dicta of several sāstras, learned men are thrilled at each word". The editor includes no Introduction in this kānda. The book is unnecessarily infiated by adding numerous pages of extracts from earlier and later works. The pages being 834 ( of the text ), one is likely to run away with the idea that it is a very extensive work. It is nothing of that sort. Very large type is employed and only 12 verses can be printed on each page even when there are no footnotes. In the Mit. edition of 1926 (Nir. Press ) the verse quotations in the com. are printed continuously and the footnotes also are printed continuously in very small type and occupy one or two lines and extracts from other works are very rarely cited. The type is much smaller than that in the G. 0. S. Another remarkable feature of the editing of Kalpataru kändas is that variant readings in the text are printed, even if bries, not in continuous lines, but one below the other even if each variant reading contains only a few letters, e. g. pp. 15-20 ), Tirtha kānda and Gr. Kānda pp. 230-34 may be seen; but in the Vyavahārakānda examples of unnecessary waste of space are found by the dozen, vide pp. 699 and 819 on each of which 13 references each occupying nearly half a page could have been compressed in five lines or less, if they had been printed conti nuously. But even this is a small matter in the Vyavabāra section. The learned editor quotes very large extracts from works earlier and later than the Kalpataru. Some glaring examples may be indicated. Visvarīpa, wbose priority to Laksmīdhara by a few centuries is an established matter, is quoted frequently and even long extracts are given ( vide pp. 8, 13, 17, 45, 60, 72, 82, 158 &c. ). Similarly, Asahāya

( com. of Vāraila ) is quoteri duzens of times ( extreme exam ples being on pp. 175 and 320, where more than half the page is occupied by id quotation from Asahāya ): Merlhātithi also is quoted dozens of times ( e. y. on 1'1). 7-8, 20, 24, 27, 29, 37, 58, 80, 89 dc.). Authors and works later than Lakoni Jhara's are also quoted in footnotes e. g. the Smrticamerikā ( on pţ: 211, 56, 66, 438 &c). The Virāılaratnākara is quoteil on almost every page as the editor himself animits on p. 845. What is the object of these extensive anil numerous quotations from anthors later than Laksmidhara! In the Introduction it could have been easily demonstrated how some works borrow extensively from the Kalpataru. The Viramitrulaya ( which belongs to the first half of the 17th century ) is cited about a hundreid times. One does not know whether the elitor had been commissioned to do all this or whether he did all this at his own sweet will. The text as printed is several times conjectural; for example, viile note 4 on p. 376 of Vy. l. 5. Certain other matters must also be pointed out here. Many verses of Yāj. are citel in the Yya vahāra-Kalpataru without a word of explanation or comment, while the Mitāksartă explains them at length. A few striking examples may be cited here. (1) On Yaj. I. 52 53 the Mit. has a long note on the meaning of sapinda' and on limits of sapinda relationship. Kalpataru ( Gr. kārula ) has no discu ssion on this.20 2 ) On Yrj. I. 81 ( and 79 ) the Mit. holds a long discussion whether it is rörlhi, wiyunue or puerisun khyā. Kalpatarn ( on Gr. ) has no such discussion ; (3) On Yaj. II. 24 the Kalpataru ( Vy. p. 186 ) has not a word of explana tion or comment, while the Mit. levotes two printed pages to this verse ; ( 4 ) On Yij. II. 20 the Vy. p. 265 has four lives of explanation while Mit devotes one page; (5) On Yaj. II. 52 the Mit has one pare of exevesis, while kalı ataru ( Vy. }', 303 ) has not a word of comment of its own ; ( 6 ) On Yāj. II. 152 (siimanta vī &c.) the Vy. p. 442 has not a word of comment, while Mit. levotes more than one page of cominent, (7) On Yāj. II. 265 (first half) the comment is almost the same in the lit. anii Kilpia? Vy. p. 361). There are miny passages of

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Many such examples about verses of Yaj. ( commented upon at some length by the Mit. and only quoted without comment or with very brief comments by Laksmidhara ) can be cited from other Kandas, but for reasons of space the pre sent author has to be content with stating some striking exa mples from the Srādbba-kânda. Yāj. I. 256 refers to the times of Ekoddistaśrāddha. The Mit. has two closely printed pages of comment on this. Kalpataru ( on Srāddha ) merely quotes the verse and has no word of comment. Similarly, on Yāj. I. 252 the Mit. devotes one page of comment, while Kalpo. ( on Srāddha ) has no comment ). Yāj. I. 253-254 (deal. ing with Sa pindīkarana ) have three printed pages of comment. ( one page being devoted to evolving order out of varying views of the Sapiņdikaraṇa of one's inother ( acc. to Paithi nasi, Yama, and Uśanas, while the Kalpataru on Srāddha quotes Yāj. I. 253-54 ( on p. 257 ) and sets out only one view; (p. 258 ), but the Mit. bas a vyavasthā on three different views similarly, on Yāj. I. I. 256 ( on the proper times for Ekoddi sta-srāddha the Mit. quotes the verses of about a dozen sages and of Dāksiņātyas, Urddhas and brings order out of the chaos, while Kalpataru od Srāddhao ( pp. 250 and 262 ) quotes Yāj. I. 256 ( badly printing it on p. 250 ) and hardly refers to several sages and views. The Kalpa'. on Sráddha p. 257 quotes the two verses but has only less than two lines of comment. 
The present author finds that, compared with citations from Kātyāyana, Nārada, Bșhaspati and Manu, the Kalpataru (on Vyavabăra ) is sparing in its quotations from Yājña valkya and further has no words of comment in many places at all even when it cites Yāj. 
The present writer bas a suspicion that Lakşmīdhara wanted to avoid comparison of his performance with the lear ned explanatious of the Mit. 
That scholars should not be misled by the bulky nature of the volume on Vyavahāra, some further matters must be brought to their notice. On pp. 394, 395 the text consists of only three lines and on p. 397 of only five lines, the rest being taken up by extracts from other works and arguments. In the following cases half the page or more than half is taken up by quotations from other works or arguments ( in a few cases ) or readings ( rarely ) viz. pp. 320-1, 365, 387-90,

The present author has not shown the waste of space in in other kánlas for reasons of space. The same thing is found in other kvindes. For example, in the Gr. Kānda half a page or more has been taken up by the footnotes, viz pp. 4, 7, 9, 10, 14 18-20, 24, 35-6, 40, 48, 50, 62 (18 footnotes), 70, 73, 96, 181-2, 230, 232, 301, 415 etc. After carefully considering the matters to which attention has been drawn above, the present author asserts without fear of contradiction that the text of kūnla XII. on Vyavahara is smaller in mere extent than the Mitäksarā on Yāj. II. ( dealing with the same subject which has been printed in sinall type and in a com pact manner awl that, as regaris quality, it is far inferior to the Mitāksari. It is unnecessary to cite instances where Mit. refers to the Piramiminsi and its commentators in the sec tion ou Vyavalira alone ( is in the Intro. to Vāj. II. 114, on II, 135-136, 11. 137 c. ), while in the Kalpataru ou Vyava håra discussions on or references to Pūrvamimāṁsā are gene rally conspicuous by their absence. 
XIII. The thirteenth Kända dealt with Santika'(pro pitiatory rites for averting a deity's wrath or effects of evil planetary influences or other misfortunes ) and Paustika rites such as homu, and the like performed for longevity &c.

( Continued from the previous page ) last line and not to dvija varah' as the editor seems to hold, Keeping in mind that the verge purports to be composed by Lakşmi. dhara himself, it would be the heigbt of conceit on his part to suggest thit Sanandana and others ( to whom, according to the Mahābhārata and Purānas, God himself imparted the highest bliss were hankering to learn from Laksmīdhara ( a puny mortal of the 12th century A. D.). The learned Editor sticks to his opinion (originally occurring in the Intro. to Dābakānda p. 56 ) in his Intro. duction (p. 18 n, 1 ) to the Mokşakanda. The Puranas state that Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana and Sanatkumāra are the mind-born sons of Brahm; vide Nāradiya-purāņa ( pūrvabhäga 2. 3 ), Brahma. puräna I. 46-47 ( about Sapat-kumāra ), Kūrmapurāna (1, 7, 19-21, Vāmadapurāba 60,68 and Paramasanhitā 31. 16-19 ( the last a Pāñca. rātra work ). Kārşrājini quotes (id Aparārka p. 138 ) verses that Sapaka, Sananda, Sanátana, Kapila, Asuri, Vodha and Pancasikha these seven are sons of Brahmā. These are ancient names. The Chão. Up. ( VII. 6. 1-2 and VII, 26.2 ) states that Nārurla who had studied the four l'odas and all other lores then known approached Sanatkumára for Atmavidyä, learnt it from him and reached beyond the darkness of ignorance (tasniai...... tamasas--param darśa yati bhagavān Sapatkumāraḥ)'. Sankarācārya flourished at least three centuries before Lakşmidbara. Many scholars differed from him and did uot spare him. If Laksmidhara ditfered from him why does be not expressly say so? The prosent author thinks that Lakşmidhara, an active administrator of a large kingdom for many years and also it yreat commander hall not thoroughly studied the L'panişds, the Vedāntasūtra and the whāşyas thereon and on the Gita and was not gure of himself and purposely avoided making ex plicit statements on the ditfering views of the Bhāsyakiras on the Upanisads, the Vedintasūtra and Giti. He does not employ the Viģistādvaita terminology such as the words Prupatti, sit and acit. yvūhas and does not in his own words dilate upon the Bhāgarata or Påūcarütra system,

78. The Kalpatiru of Lakşmīdhara 
677 
speaks of Moksa as identity ( ekatanatā ) with highest Brah man, the conclusion follows that it breathes the pure Advaita Vedānta. The present author has no desire to argue at length with the editor who did not apparently know his own mind as shown by the notes cited here. In the notes (to Moksa Kānda ) ou p. 327 he remarks `his ( Laksmidhara's) view of Mokşa does not agree with the Advaita or the Viśistādvaita and adds 'Mukti is said to consist in the absorption of the jīva in Brahman (aikya, layo or tunmaya ). This is the view of Bhāskara'. On p. 340 of the Notes on Visņu purāna quoted at great length on pp. 102-108 of Moksa künda the editor remarks in fact the long quotation from the Visnupurāna which is held up as the true view (and so the author's ) contains many indications of a trend towards Visi stādvaita and of opposition to Advaita ' and then specifies four indications. As stated above the Editor was in two minds and probably Laksmilhara and his helpers might have been in the same predicament. On p. 343 the explanation of the word 'Yogayuktah' in Gītă V. 6-7 by Lakşmīdhara as 
advaitadarśane sthitaḥ ' induces the editor to say that Laksmīdhara leans more to Bhāskara. In the notes on p. 341 referring to Visņupurāna ( 3 verses quoted on p. 113 ) the edi tor remarks the leaning of Laksmīdhara to Viśistādvaita in this may be noted'. The present author does not want to say much here. One thing appears to be almost certain viz. that Laksmidhara composed his digest according to the present author at the earliest from 1125 to 1145 A. D. It is difficult to hold that the bhāsya of Rāmānuja who belonged to South India had penetrated to Kanoj and was studied there ten years before 1130 A. D. by Lakşmidhara and the pandits who helped him. 
Besides, Laksmidhara and his helpers do not appear to have been profound students of the Upanişads and the Vedā ntasūtra and the bhâsyas thereon. They appear to have been mere paurāņikas or reciters of the Mahābhārata so far as Mokoa is concerned. Laksmidhara, after quoting Bhagavad gītā Il. 59 (on p. 98 ) explains (on p. 99 ) ' rasa varjam-itya tra raso råga iti Gītābhāsyam'. It should be noted that the word Gītābhāsyam' is in the singular ( nominative ). The natural and proper inference is that he refers to a single bhāsya on the Gītā. If he meaut to refer to more than one blāsya on the Gītā, he would have said Gitabhāsye (nomi 
678 
Ilistory of Dhurmuśāstra 
native dual) or Gītābhāsyāni (plural). The editor jumps to the conclusion that L. was conversant with the bhāsyas of both Saikara and Rāmānuja. This is an unwarranted conclusion. L. meant to refer to a single bhänya that is clear. The learned editor could have said that L. refers to Rāmäuuja's bhäsya alone. He would have then been met by the reply that Sankara's bhavya was about 300 years earlier than Laksmidhara and than Riminuji's bhâsya and Sankara does explain the word 'rasia' as 'riya' (as admitt ed by the editor ) and that there is nothing to prove that Rāmānuja's bhāsya on the Gitit was stu lied in north India as early as the first and second quarters, of the 12th century A. D). 
• 
Rāmánuja is said to have been persecuted by Kulottunya Cola (1070-1120 A. D.). Prof. Nilakanta Sastri in his work on the Colas' ( 2nd, el. 1955 ) appears to hold that the mate rial is shifty, that to refrain from logmatising is as neces sary as it is difficult, but (on 1'. (44) he says the leading instance of religious intolerance in the period of Chola rule is that of the persecution of Ramānuja and his followers by a Cola monarch whose identity is not altogether free from doubt. The traditional dates of Rāmánuja's birth and death are 1017-1137 A. D. (i. e, he is supposed to have lived for 120 years. He composed many works. His blāsya on the Gitā presupposes his bhásya ou the Vedāntasútra and the bhāsya on the latter (called Sribhāsya) presupposes his work Vedārthasaji yraha ( vide Sribhäşya, ed. by V. M. Abhyankar sastri, on I. 1. 1 p. 58 ). He wrote also other works. If we believe that he was persecuted by Kullottunga ( Chola or some other Chola Kiny ) his works could not have spread to the North easily or before his death. Further, the Moksakānda is the last of the 14 Kāudas and so must have been the last to be handled in the series of Kānday. It will he shows a little later on that the kādas were taken up in order one after another and not in pellmell order. The present author thinks that Laksmihara refers in the word Gitäbhiisyam on p. 99 of the Moksakārla to the blisya of Sarkaricārya ( in a colour less way ), probably because he had no definite opinions of his own on the abstruse questions of the branches of Advaita philosophy. In E. I. Vol. XIV PP. 83-96 (on the Srirangam plates of Mummaui Nayaka of Saka-samvat 1280, ed. by T. A. 

78. The Kalpataru of Laksmīdhara 
679 
Gopinatharao ) at p. 86 reference is made to Rāmāpuja's stay for not less than 20 years in Hoysala country and to his return to Srirangam after the death of the persecuting Cola king in A. D. 1118 and that the remaining third part of the Sribhāsya was finished then. This would lead to the conclusion that the Sribhäsya was completed at the earliest about 1120 A. D. or a little later. The Gitābhāsya pre-supposes the Srībhasya and therefore it might have been composed about 1125 or later. Some years must have elapsed before mss. of it reached Northern India and were studied there. If the 
Gītābhāsyam' mentioned in the Moksakında ( p. 99 ) is to be understood as Rāmāpuja's bbāsya it would follow that the Moksa-kānda of the Kalpataru could not have been composed before at least 1140 or 1145 A. D. 
The above views have been advanced on the basis more or less of the traditional dates of Rāmānujācārya's birth and death. 
No epigraphic record directly mentioning Rāmānuja has been found so far. 
The results of modern research differ a great deal from the traditional accounts and among themselves. An impor tant contribution is that of Mr. T. A. Gopinatha Rao who deli vered the Sir Subrahmanya Aiyyar Lectures on the History of Sri-Vaisnavas' in 1917, which were published in 1923. He refers (pp. 14-15 ) to several Guruparamparās and monogra phs on individual acāryas. The earliest extant work ( accord ing to him ) is the Divyasūricarita of Garudavāhana Pandita 923 who claims to be a contemporary of Rămănujícārya and it mentions no yugas and years but only the month, tithi and the nakyatra at the time of the Alvārs and ācāryas. It appears to the present author that most of these traditional

accounts (particularly the later ones) are altogether unreli able. For example, the dates of the birth and death of Srī Rāmānuja are given in them as 1017 and 1137 A. D. But in some accounts about Alvandār, the grandson of Nātha muni and the Guru of Rāmāmja, it is stated that he (i.e., Alvandār ) was born after 1024 A. D. i. e. the traditional accounts lead to this that the teacher was born after the disciple (vide p. 31 of Gopinatha Rao's Lectures ). It is not necessary for the present author to go into the different rates and events. Two-thirds of the Sribhāsya had been finished, according to the traditional sources, when the Cola persecu tion began and it was completed, according to the Rānānuja rya-divyacaritam, in Saku 1077 ( 1155 A. D.) Vide p 34 of Gopinath Rao's Lectures. The Gītābhāsya of Rāmānuja was composed ( as proved by internal evidence ) after the Sri bhāsya. If the word Gitābhāsyam (on p. 99 of the Vy. Kānda ) refers to Rāmānuja's bhâsya as Prof. Aiyanyar argues ( vide above ) then the Vy. Kānda must have been completed long after 1155 A. D. There is no doubt that the Mit. was completed before 1125-26 A. D. at the latest (as shown above ). Therefore, it would follow that L. came several decades after it and borroweil from it. Mr. Gopinath Rao advances certain arguments and concludes (p. 34 ) 'it is extremely likely that the date of the completion of the work (Sri-bhāsya ) was 1047 Saka ( 1135 A. D. ) and Saka 1077 is a mistake for 1047'. On pp. 37–38 Mr. Gopinath Rao holds that the persecutor of Rāmánuja was the Cola king Kūlottunga l. On the other hand, Mr. T. N. Subramaniam in the long Introduction to South Indian temple Inscriptions Vol. III part 2 ( Mariras Govt. Oriental Series No. CLI adds a note on the date of Rāmánuja (pp. 147-160 ), and holds that the Divyasuri-caritam and Yatirājavaibharam are later compositions, that Tamil verses quoted in the Rāmā nujārya-divyacaritai are perbasis the earliest of the available materials and traws the following conclusions ( p. 160 ): 
(1) Kūlottunga II was the Cola monarch who was the contemporary of Rāmānuja and who persecuted him and the followers of the Vaisnava faith ; ( 2 ) the flight of Rāmānuja from the Chola dominion to tha Hoysala country took place in 1138 A. D. (3) he returned to Srirangam after twelve years on hearing of the death of the Chola who persecuted him in 1150 A. D. and (4) the Srībhâsyam was completed only in78. The Kulpataru of Likşmidhura 
681 
Saka 1977 or 1155-56 A. D. after his return from Mysore. If these conclusions were accepted, it would follow that the Gītābhāsya was completed by Rămânuja about or after 1160 A. D. and that, if'Gītābhāsyam ') on 1. 99 of Moksakānda refers to Rāmānuja's bhåsya then that part was composed not earlier than 1165-70 A. D. i. e. about fifty years after the latest date for the Mitāksarā. 
The references to the Upanisads and the Vedāntasūtra in the Moksakānda are very few. On p. 6 there is a reference to Chandogya Up. (VIII. 3. *). On . 62 in explaining Manu VI. 83 ādhyatmikain ca satatam Vedāntābhihitam ca yať, there is a reference to the Br. lp. but the Brahmasūtra passage is not expressly stated. On p. 143 the Chāndogya Up. VIII. 2.1 is mentioned and Vedānta sūtra IV. 4. 1 relating to it is quoted. On p. 262 a short passage from Br. Up. VI. 2.15 ‘arciso ahah, ahna āpīryamūna-paksam' is quoted and very briefly explained. The Upanişads, the Vedāntasūtra and Gītā are lield by all ācāryas to be the three primary and principal sources of Vedāntaśāstra. The first two do not appear to have been much studied or relied on by Laksmi dhara and his helpiers; they have hardly quoted even a dozen Upanisad passages nor even three sūtras out of the 555 of the Vedāntasītra, but have quoteil luun:lreds of verses from the Mahābhārata and Puranas. There is no reference to basic texts like 'tat-tramasi'( Chāndogya VI. 8.7 repeated seve ral times later ) oraham brahmāsmi' (Br. Up. I. 4. 10 ), or 
Satyam jñānam-anantam Brahma 'Tai Up I1, 1). Here and there a verse is quoted (which occurs in an Upanisad as the verse' esa sarvesu' which is Kathopanisad 3 12 but cited after Gītā passages (on p. 133 of 14th Kanda ). On p. 143 one passage from Chāu. Upis quoted and a sutra is quoted. 
On p. 202 the editor cites a few words984 from Br. Up. III. 8.9 and II. 1.20 and from Chūn. Up. I. 5.3, all in a mutilated state without specifying the work from which they are taken.

History of Dhurmaśāstra 
Laksmīdhara quotes about 105 verses from the Manu-smrti in Moksakānda (principally from chapters VI and XII). From the Mahābhārata hundreds of verses are quoted among the Purānas, the Vişnujurāna, the Mārkandeya, Narasimha, Brahma, Brahmānda and Vāyu are largely quoted. Among smrti writers, Yāj., Daksa, Derala, Sankha, Sankhalikhita, Hárīta are largely quoted. Many verses are quoted from the Yogiyájñavalkya, comparatively a late work. This shows that the chief primary sources of Vedānta viz. Upanisads and the Vedāntasūtra were almost totally neglected and secondary and even tertiary sources such as Puranas aud Yogiyājñavalkya are very much in evidence. The topics dis cussed in the Moksakānda are: Introduction to Mokså (from Mārkandeyapurána, chap. 38 ), Moksasvariipa, Vänarasthya (becoming a forest hermit ), the dharmas of a forest hermit (Manu VI. 5-16 and 27-32 and others ), the stage of a Yati (chiefly Manu VI. 33-37 and 41 etc. ), the procedure of sannyāsa, Dharmas of a Yati, viz. Vairagya ( freedom from desires ), giving up Kāma, anger, greed &c., control of senses ; creation of the tuttuus acc. to Sankhya; thoughts on the bodies of gods, on human bodies (as dirty &c.) and of lower animals; Jiva and Brahma; about Jñana and Karma; the matters that lead to ātmajñāna; Yoga with its ramifications, the nature of dhyeya ( what is to be contemplated upon ); sigus when one is successfully pursuing Yoga ; the ten Upasarga (hindrancess )

History of Dharmaśāstra 
A few remarks about the text of this large mibandha would not be out of place. The manuscript meterial was rather meagre and inferior. For eximțile, on p. VIII in the Preface to the Br. Kānia it is stated that the erlition is based on a single ms and on p. IX it is stated that the Urlaipur is ( which belongs to the 16th century A. D. probably ) was full of large elisions and omissions, that such omissions were filled up from citations of the saine passages in later digests and that the inissing parts so suplilieil are shown within rectan gular brackets. On p. 279 in a note the Editor himself says that the ms. is very defective. The editor does not give even a specimen page of that ms. nor does heilescribe who the scribe was or how many folios it containeil. In Vy. Kānda on 1. 376 the editor remarks ( in note 4 ) mss corrut, passages restored conjecturally from the mss. and the following comment and citation in the Vivādaratnakara ( then quotes three lines from V. R. } 130 ). The most remarkable thing is that he does not put his conjectural reading in square brackets as he does in some other cases. On p. 377 lie notes that there is a gap of more than two printed pages up to the top of p. 380 in Udaipur and Bikaner mss. In the case of the Vratakānda (6th in the series of kinds ) the Editor states (on p. VI Pre. face) that the edition 'is based on the Nagpur and Ujjain Mss. Not a word more is said about the scribe, the number of folios, the date of the copying of the mss. or other details. That page also states that the Nagpur Ms. was so brittle that the cura tor woulil not allow a mechanical photographing and that somehow a transcript of such a dilapidated ms. was made on the spot and supplied to the Editor. One would naturally feel great diffidence before drawing chronological and other conclusions based on a text that is constituted from such materials. As regards the Sraddhakānda, there is no descrip tion of the mss. anywhere. As regards some Kāndas the mss. material seems to have been somewhat better. For example, as regards the Dāna-kāņla, on pp. 124-126 of the Introduc tion he gives some information of the mss. relied upon for constituting the text. But the description of the mss. is not what is required in such cases but is vague. In this kiindu the editor expends thirty payes ( lp. 383-412 ) for set ting out the relings of a ms from the Vaypur Bhosle Raja's Library. If only important reailinys had been given (aud not also obvious scribal errors ), a few pages only would have 
78. The Kalpataru of Luksmīdhara 
685 
been enough. In the Grhasthakānda also 25 pages (pp. 430 460 ) are expended on various readings of two mss. In the Vy. Kānda the preface ( pp. VIII-IX ) refers to some mss. and copies, but no detailed descriptions of mss. or copies are given in one place and the footnotes refer merely to mss. J. A. S. B. and S. K. and Ja (i.e. mss from Jammu ) and 'da'( Dar bhanga ms). The state of the mss and this way of dealing with them detracts greatly from the value of conclusions drawn on the basis of the text presented with the help of such mss. 
The Personal History of Laksmīlhar: Our knowlede of the personal history of L. has to be derived from his own works, particularly from the Introductory rerses to the Br. Kānda and the coloļihons at the end of the different Kāndas. Most of the colophons ( as in.licated in the note below ) state L. was the son of Bhatta Hrdavadhara and was himself a Sándhirigrabika or Mahāsāndhiviyrahika i minister or great minister for peace od war), some adding that he was minister to king Govindacarira. lf the father Hrdayadhara had also been a minister for peace and war Laksmīdhara would certain ly have mentioned that fact in the Introductory verses to the Brahmacarikānula. It is somewhat remarkable that the numerous Gahadi wala inscriptions do not disclose the name of any mantrın but mention the dignitaries called Purohita, Mahattaka, Pratīhāra &c. 
There are sisteen verses in the Intro:luction to Br. Kānda. In the first three verses obeisance is offered to Visnu, Hara (Siva) anu Banu ; verses 4-i contain hightown praise of victo. rious king Govindacandra ( which will be dealt with later ); verses 8 and 9 praise Lakomidhara who is said to be the chief mantrin (minister ) of the heroic king ( Govindacandra ), whose ( Laksmithara's ) greatness is inconceivable and who provided, for the sport of two Cakravāka-like feet of the king, a river in the forin of the brilliant lustre of the jewelled crowns of many kings; low many wicked kings have not been sent to their doom by this best of seekers ( after great powers ) who is solely devotel to the vow of fighting and who also seeks Vidyās. who, in securing the earth girt by the ocean for the king of Kāśi, offereil in the fire of valour one lakh of the lotus like heads of enemy kings, and then verse ten contains high praise of his own work called Kalpavrksit that yields the fruits of Dharma, Artha, Kana and immortality ( moksa) and

verses 11 to 13 mention three works that preceded bis; he speaks rather slightingly about two of them and very dispara gingly about the third. These verses may be tanslated as follows: 'Gopāla, his (i.e. Lakşınidhara's ) friend composed his own work in the form of sentences ( that is, in prose?) by embodying Purana passages in some arts and often passa yes from the smrtis. But this digest (of L.) which is not extensive will be caused to be composed, that will delight the minds of learned men by its containing the essence of the Vedas and Smrtis and by the import which is set off by Mi māṁsā ( doctrines ), in which defects cannot be found at all. Will not the delightful growth of Kalpataru ( heavenly desire yielding tree, the work so called) by him (i.e. written by L.) atford pleasure to learned dvijas (or to gods and brāhmanas ). the Kalpataru on whose appearance Srī ( excellence, Laksmi) does not stay in Malvārnava ( a work so called, great oceav ), Kalpataru under which Kāmdhenu ( the work so called and the celestial cow) goes to sleep ( remains unread ) ? Now that this Kalpadruma ( desire-yielding tree, the work called Kalpataru ), owing to the power of the ambrosial sprinkling of the opulent intellect of Laksmīdhara, will, while in this world, tend to the benefit of the three worlds, why think of following after Mahārnava ( a work so called, the great ocean), why hanker after Kāmadhenu ( the celestial cow and the work so called ), to whose mind will occur the worthless Ratna mālā ( the work so called, a jewel necklace) and others? 
From these three verses we learn that Gopāla, a friend of Laksmīdhara, had already composed a work embodying in his own words the gist of Puranas and Smộtis ( that work was called Kāmadhenu, vide section on Kāmdhenu above); tbat there was another work called Mahārņava 985 and a third called Ratnamālā and some other digests had already been composed. What fault L. finds with Kamadhenu it is difficult to under stand. From passages in the Vivăılaratnākara (p. 5-6,-135, 150 ) and works such as Hāralatā it is clear that the Kāma

dhenu contained verses ( of Nárada, Katyāyana and others ) and explained them ; vide also Vyavahārakānda p. 379 note 1. The word Yayasya is important. Acc. to Pāņ. IV. 4. 91 Vuyasya means 'Vayasă tulyaḥ. Gopāla as stated in V. il of Intro. to Br. Kānda had digested single-handed smộtis and Purānas and then wrote the work called Kāmadhenu. That task must have taken several years. Therefore it would not be wrong to hold that he completed the work when he was about forty years old. After Gopāla had reached that stage Laksmīdhara started on the project of a big digest and must have been nearly of the same age at least. The word 'Kāri syate' in verse 11 above is in the future tense of the causal of the root kr (to do ). That shows that long after Gopāla's work was completed, this digest was begun and was composed not by Laksmidhara single-handed but with the help of other learned men. The Introductory verse to the Br. K. is : L. first begins to write on the first áśrama, L. who reduced the ene mies of the king of Kāśi to the stage of brahmacarya, because the enemies harassed by him, had to turn away (like brahma cārins ) from sensual pleasures, had to sleep on the earth as their bed, were reduced to the stage of begging alms, were clad only in loin cloth and were familiar with their skins (i.e. they did not cover their bodies with anything). 
The victorious Govindacandra mentioned in verse 4 (in Introd. to Br. Kānda ) is the Gâhadwāla king of that name who ruled at Kānyakubja ( modern Kanoj) and Kāśī. In verse 4 it is said · Kings were paralysed through fear by hear ing the trumpetings of the elephants of the Gauda king, who was easily (lit. sportively) threatened by Govindacandra ( vijayi Govindacandrosti yaḥ krīdātarjita-Gauda-garjita bhaya-stambhibhavat-pārthivaḥ). In verse 7 of the Intro. Govindacandra is said to have killed in battle the heroic Hammira,956 the acie amony valorous men (sauryabhājām availhir-avadhi yuddhe yena Hammira-vīraḥ). From verse 8-9 of the Intro, it follows that L. rose to be chief minister of

king Govindacandra987 and fought (as commander) many son guinary battles on behalf of his king, in which thousands of soldiers anil kings were killeil ( this statement appears cer tainly highly exaggerated ). This task of an extensive work on Dharmasastra in fourteen parts was undertaken not only after the Kāındhenu of Gopala, a friend of L., was composed but also (1) after Govindacandra fought with an (unnamed ) Gauda king; (2) after G. killel in battle Hammira ; ( 3 ) after numerous fights with other kings in which thou sands were slain; ( ) and after, as stated in Introductory verse of Rājailharma-kānda, men of character had risen to high opulence and after many kinys hail meekly submitted to Govindacanıra owing to the wonderful greatness of Laksmidhara's policies. 
There are numerous inscriptions (mostly copper-filates ) issued by the Gahadwālas. The pedigree begins with Yasovi graha ( as in E. I. IV p. 99-101 ). Candradera is described as having conquered the kingdom of Kanyakubja (in E. I. vol. VII p. 85-93 Paramabhattāraka-mahārājādhi rāja-parameśvara-nijabhujopārjitaśrī - Kanyakubjādhipatya Sri-candradeval ). 
It is necessary for our purpose to refer to a few Inscrip tions only. (1) The Basahi grant of Vikrama year 1161 (1104 A.

(3) The grant of Madanapāladeva on Akşayyatştīyā of Samvat 1164 (i. e. 1107 A. D.) made after a bath in the Ganges ( U. P. H. S. Vol. 14 pp. 69-77 ); ( 4 ) the Rahan grant of Vikrama year 1166 (1109 A. D.) issued by Govindacandra with the consent of Mahattaka Gāngeya (I. A. Vol. XVIII pp. 14–19). Here Madanapāla is described with all the high imperial titles and it is added 'asyavātmajo Mahārājaputro Govindacandradevah' and p. 16 (lines 8-9) states that Govindacandra was terrible in splitting the temples of the array of elephants belonging to the Gauda king and made Hammīra give up his enemity by oft-repeated unparalleled work in battle and this grant was made with the consent of Mahattaka Gārgeya. What had happened to Madanapāla between 1107 ( the date of his inscription cited above as No. 3) and 1109 A. D. is not clear. It is suggested by some scholars that he was captured in some battle and had to be ransomed later by Govindacandra. The Kalpataru says that Hammira was killed in battle by Govindacandra while the above inscrip tion says that Hammīra became friendly with Govindacandra. Among the pumerous inscriptions of the Gāhadwalas none refers to the killing of Hammira by Govindacandra. Probably these two are different Hammiras altogether or it is possible that L. is only reporting the legends he might have heard many years afterwards. In the undated Sārnāth inscription of queen Kumāradevī, in E. I. IX. (pp. 324, 327, verse 16 ) reference is made to Govindacandra as an incarnation of Hari (at the request of Hara ) for guariling Varanasi against the wicked Turuska warrior. In the copper-plate of King Jaya candra in Samvat 1243 (1187 A. D.) both Govindacandra and his son Vijayacandra are extolled 'veritable Bșhaspati in reflecting over various lores' (vividhavidyā-vicāra vāca spati ). 
The Gauda king with whom Govindacandra came in conflict was Rāmapāla of the Pāla dynasty of Bengal, who ruled for at least 42 years from about 1077 to 1120 A. D. (Dr. R. C. Majumdar's History of Bengal 1943, Vol. I. pp. 155 ff.). Rāmapāla kept in check the growing power of the Gāhad wālas and brought about a diplomatic marriage between Kumāradevī, whose mother was the daughter of King Mathana ( better known as Mahana ), famous Rástrakūta king and maternal uncle of Rāmapāla. It would be noticed that the grants No. 1, 2 and 4 (referred to above ) were issued by 
H. D.--87

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Govindacandra only as Rājaputra with the consent of some high diguitaries of the king; among them there is no Hrdaya dhara nor Laksmīdhara. The Sāndhivigrahika is a high functionary and occurs in Gupta Ins. No. 1 (the praśasti of Samudragupta) on pp. 10, 16 and Mabāsandhivigrahika in the Gupta Inscription No. 22 of Hastin in Gupta year 163 pp. 100, 104, in Vinnu-charmottara-purīna II. 24. 24-25 and the mit. on Yāj. I. 320 provides that the lekhaku of a royal grant should be the minister for peace and war, being ordered by the king himself to do so. 
As regards Hammīra, with whom Govindacandra fought but became friendly in 1109 A. D. he is generally identified with Hájib Tughă-tigin, who invaded India between 1099– 1155 A. D. (vide Dr. Viyogi's work 23, 58-59). Any moslem chief or commander was, it appears, spoken of in Sanskrit Inscriptions as Hammíra e. g. another Hammira (other than the one that clashed with Govindacandra ) is mentioned as having come in conflict with Vijayacandra, son of Govinda candra ( vide I. A. Vol. 15 pp. 7-9). Hammira is mentioned as killed by Vijayacandra in another inscription of Saivat 1237 ( 22nd Feb. 1181 A. D.) in Lucknow Museum Plates of Jayacandra ( E. I. vol. I. 24 pp. 291-95 at p. 294 verse 10 ). 
One of the earliest dated Inscriptions of Govindacandra as king is the Kamauli Plate of Samvat 1171 (of 15–10-1114 ) in E. I. IV pr. 101-103, a slightiy earlier one by a few months being the one in J. B. 0. R. S. Vol. XIX pp. 233 ff. and he ruled till 1154 A. D. One of his latest inscriptions is dated 10-8-1154 (in E. I. 1V pp. 116-17). Lakşmidhara nowhere refers to Govindacandra as Mahārāja putra (as done by the Rahan grant, I. A. Vol. XVIII pp. 14-19 set out above ). He appears to have come in contact with Govindacan dra after the latter became king in 1114 A. D. but the exact date when he came to the notice of king Govindacandra is stated nowhere. However learned and clever a man may be it is many years before he becomes chief minister (as Laks mīdhara became and says in verse 8 of the Intro. to Br. Kānda). On his own showing he fought many sanguinary battles with the foes of Govindacandra in which one hundred thousand warriors were killed. This may be an over-drawn picture, yet there may be a substratum of truth in it. Further, by his wonderful handling of political affairs, he forced many78. The Kalpataru of Laksmīdhara 
691 
rulers to acknowledye Govindacandra as suarain ( Intro. ver se to Rājadharmakānda ) and bow at his feet. As all these varied activities of L. and his becoming chief minister are mentioned in the Intro. to Br. K., it clearly follows that he started the plan of the great digest some time after he found peace and leisure. Supposing L. came to the notice of Govin dacandra in 1115 (i. e. immediately after he became king ), his rise to the position of a chief minister, sanguinary battles and conquests should have taken at least ten or fifteen years more i. e. it appears that he could not have started the plan of a large digest before 1125 or 1130 A. D. i. e..some years after the latest date that can be assigned to the Mit. 
Laksmīdhara appears to have been self-centred and boastful. He mentions Gopāla as a friend and as one who composed a work in which he maile use of Smrtis and Purāna passages and names the Kāmadhenu ( which was the work of Gopāla as shown above ) and mentions both slightingly (in verses 11-13 of Intro, to Br. K.). He had not the goodness even to acknowledge some merit in his friend's work and to advance the interest of his less fortunate friend by expressly quoting a few passages from that work. He studiously avoids quoting any passage expressly from the Kāmadhenu. He thus treated his friend most shabbily. 
From what Candeśvara and others say about the Kāma dhenu the latter appears to have been a good work on several branches of Dharmaśāstra not inferior in performance to Bhoja's work and the Kalpataru. For example, the Krtyaratnākara of Candeśvara ( on p. 30 ) speaks of the Kamadhenu as equal in authority to the Rājā (i. e. Bhoja · Rājatulyayogakşema ). In the same work on p. 156 Bhūpăla, Kāmadhenu and Kalpa taru are spoken of in the same breath. On p. 443 of the same work, we have the passage Gopāla-Bhūpāla-Kalpataru-Pāri jātesu tu Sākațānyajávikam iti pāțhal sa tu suga mah'. The present author cannot help suspecting that L. feared com parison of his work with Gopālas and so tried to ignore and disparage it and that he might have quietly made use of Gopāla's work without-acknowlerlgement. L. studiously avoids reference to Dhāreśvara Bhoja, Srikara and Bhāruci, whom the Mit. frequently mentions, as shown in the present author's paper on the predecessors of Vijnanesvara in J. B. B R. A. S. for 1925 pp. 193-221 ). Phoja's greatness and death 
692 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
are referred to in an early Gāladvāla grant, viz. the Basahi grant of 1104 A. D. where we have the verse 'yāte śrī-Bhoja bhūpe vibudhavaravadhū-netrasīmātithitvam' (verse 3 in I. 
A. vol. 14 at p. 103 ). 
Lakşmīdhara might have been a learned man in his own way and had experience as a councillor, administrator and probably as a judge also. But the editor makes certain claims for him which cannot be allowed at all. On p. 10 of the Intro. to Dānakānda, the editor says “his digest which ... shows that he was a Mīnāṁsaka profoundly learned in the Veda. On p. 11 (of Intro. to Dānakānda ) the editor asserts even without his explicit references to Kumārila (as Bhattapāda ) and Sabarasvămin ), proficiency in Pūrvamīmāṁsā necessary for the study, understanding and exposition of Dharmaśāstra is evident throughout the work'. 
In the eleven Kändas so far printed the present author has not been able to find a single discussion on any sūtra of Jaimini or Sabara's extensive bhāsya. The present author would like to be corrected. What he is emphasizing is that Lakşmīdhara's extensive work gives no evidence whatever of a deep study of the sūtras of Jaimini nor of Sabara's very large bhāsya nor do his kāņdas mention even a few well known nycīyas ( vide pp. 1339, 1351 of Vol. V. of H. of Dh. for the mention of about 170 nyāyas, mostly mentioned from Mimāmsā works). Sabarasvāmi is once mentioned on p. 831 of the Vy. Kānda 988 in connection with some words in Sarkha

The Editor has not been able to locate the part of Sabara's bbágya where this occurs. The present author thinks that the above words ale quoted from a commentary on Sankha-likuita by Sabarasvāmin, who may be an entirely different person from the bhūşyakära of Jaitini's sutras.

likhita. So far as I see Kumārila is only twice mentioned as Bhatta-pāda in Br. Kanda on p. 15 and p. 21 (a verse from Tantravārtika ). It is most extravagant praise to say on this slender basis that Lakşmīdhara's proficiency in Pūrva. mīmāmsă is evident throughout the work. 
Certain passages in the Kalpataru on Vy. are more or less identical with passages of the Mit. A few examples are noted below* :

II. 276, the Mit. has भक्तमशनन् । अवकाशो निवासस्थानम् । अग्निः चोरस्य शीतस्यापनोदाद्यर्थः । उदकं तृषितस्य । मन्त्रः चौर्यप्रकारोपदेशः । उपकरणं चौर्यसाधनम् । व्ययः अपहारार्थ देशान्तरं गच्छतः पाथेयम् and then explains the rest of the verse ; कल्प० (व्यव.) p. 548 has these very words and not a word more'; (9) On Yij. II. 174 ( panan – ekasaphe &c. ), the Mit. explains the whole verse in over four lines - एकशफे अश्वादौ प्रनष्टाधिगते तत्स्वामी राज्ञे रक्षणनिमित्तं चतुरः पणान् दद्यात् &c ; कल्प. ( व्यव. p. 554 has only the words एकशके... पणान् दद्यात् and nothing more than that one line. The words — तत्र सांख्यानामेका मूलप्रकृति'......up to त्रीण्यन्तःकरणानि' are the same in Aparārka p. 987 lines 4-7 after eight lines from Devala while in Moksakanda p. 1,006 these four lines begin a new section with the words ' तत्र देवलः । तत्र सांख्यानामेका......' and end 
with the words त्रीण्यन्तःकरणानि दश बहिःकरणानि.

78. The Kalpataru of Laksmīdhara 
695 
composed between 1100-1120 A. D. and the Kalpataru bet ween 1125-1145 A. D. the latter must be presumed to be the borrower. The present author is not much interested in the question whether the Kalpataru borrowed or not. He is in terested only in negativing the astounding statement of Prof. Aiyangar that the Mit. kvew the Kalpataru (as disclosed by verse 4 at the end of the Mit. ). Unless it is proved that the Kalpataru was completed at least some years before 1100 A. D. it is impossible to hold that it was known or relied upon in the South by the Mit. in 1100-1120 A. D. The learned editor of the Kalpataru admits ( on p. 4 of the introduction to Dánakānda) that the influence of L. did not penetrate to South India and that he is not referred to by Varadarāja (a. of Vya nahāranirnaya ) by Devamna bhatta (a. of Smộticandrikā) and by Madhavācārya. In view of the historical sequence of events and the large number of identical explanatory passages in the Kalpataru, the present author thinks that it is unnecessary for him to reply to the arguments of the editor of the Kalpataru in greater detail. 
The late Prof. Aiyangar did not carefully consider the chronological sequence of events and the close agreement of the brief explanations of L. with the lengthy explanations in the Mitākṣarā. In the first edition of the H. of Dh. the present author relied upon a passage occurring in the Saras vatibhavan ms. of the Kalpataru about a quotation from Bphaspati relied upon in the Vădibhayankara (the author of which was according to the Vīramitroda ya, a follower of Vijñāneśvara. The Editor of Kalpataru on Vy. (on p. 248 )

The FT05 makes a half verse of this by omitting some words and citing only tofauti na fatu: 996 11 1703 (p. 102). This might have been purposely done by Lakşmidbara to shorten the matter. On p. 100 let us consider one example. The lines as printed in the portion of Mokşakānda (cf. Kalpataru ) are : TFTTHEHAI THIETTO FESTA I F OTO HOT &c. This should have been prin. ted as 'T ZIT HI &eó' and TEHTAPATA JATO I fela

History of Dharmaśāstra 
refers to this view of the present author and rejects it. It is unnecessary for the present purpose to go into the question where what Vādibhayankara quotes as a verse of Brhaspati is 80 or not. One ms of Kalpataru ( Vy. ) had that passage, two other mss. from Udaipur and Bikaner had not got it. Prof. Aiyangar does not hesitate to pass off as Laksmīdhara's the whole of the Br. Kānda based only on a single very defective ms, (vide above) and to draw conclusions from it. Besides, he himself shows ( on p. 293, note 4 ) how his Udaipur ms. bas a gap of two printed pages beginning on that page. He could and should have said that it is possible that the single ms may represent the correct text while the two others having gaps in some other parts might have omitted that portion. The present author also relied ( in the first edi tion of the H. of Dh.) on a passage of the Benares College ms (on Vy. ) where the view of Prakāśa, Halāyudha, Kāmadhenu and Pārijāta on a verse of Kātyāyans was cited (H. of Dh. p. 293, n. 649 ). With this the Editor deals on pr. 394-5 and 397, (in footnotes ). The present author would have to write several pages against this view of the Editor. For the present author's own view about L. being later than the litaksarã and the borrower, relies mostly on the historical data and inci dents and on the large number of passages in one Kānda alone (cited above ) which fair minded persons would hold to be borrowings from the Mitākṣarā by the Kalpataru. 
In the Intio, to the Dānakānda (p. 17 ) Prof. Aiyangar states in two other respects also the Kalpataru is unique. Firstly, it is distinguished by having been written in accor dance with well-conceived and logical plan. A cursory read ing of even a comprehensive smrti like that of Manu or Yājíma valkya will fail to disclose the background of Hindu life.' Compare this downright assertion with another statement in Intro. to Br. Kānda (p. 3)‘it is built on a careful plan, which largely follows the arrangement of topics in Manu's great work.' The present author does not like to say much against the learned Professor as regards his criticism of Manu that reading it would not disclose the background of Hindu life, because he contradicts himself by saying that L. largely follows Manu's plan and because he really follows Yāj, and the logic, if any, behind the order of the 11 Kāndas is restrict ed to the first tive and the Kāndas eleven, twelve and fourteen. 
78. The Kalpataru of Lakşmidhara 
697 
It must be, however, pointed out that it is the Yājña valkyasmști that lays down a careful and logical plan. The Yāj. Smrti, after the first nine Introductory verses, treats in order of the following topics; Brab macārin (I. 10-50 ), Grhas thāśrama (I. 51-96 ), daily duties of Grhastha ( Āhnika I. 97 181 ), Dāna (I. 198-216 ), Srāddha ( I. 217–268 ), Rājadharma (I. 309-368 ), Vyavabāra (II. 1-307), Āśauca (III. 1-34), Vänaprastha (III. 45-55 ), Yatidharma (III. 56-205 ),Prāyas citta (III, 206-334 ). The order in Yāj. from Brahmacărin to Srāddha is almost the same as Laksmīdhara's but is a little better than that of L. Similarly, Yāj. speaks of rāja dharma before vyavahăra (as L. does ). But the logic in placing vratn, as 6th and tirtha as 8th, pratisthā (or pūjā or both ) as 7th and placing Sāntika as 13th (and not after Pūjā) is not clear to the present author. The fact appears to be that the learned Editor having spent many years over the Kalpataru developed a faculty for over-statements about L. 
The Kalpataru is extensive, but the Viramitrodaya is unique in its size, range and quality. The Kalpataru has size (though it is not as extensive as the Viramitrodaya ), has great range, but in quality it is very much inferior not only to the Mitāksarā, but also to some other digests. Lengthy discussions in the Kalpataru are few and far between. It is more in the nature of a collection from all smrtis. Hence one noteworthy feature of it is that it often states how the same verse occurs in several smrtis. A few striking examples are noted here. In Sraddha-kānda p. 187 he quotes Manu III 236-37 and remarks that they occur in Hārīta, Visņu, Yama, Sätātapa in Uśanas ( the 2nd only ). In Br. kāņda p. 40 he quotes Manu III. 114-15 and adds that these two occur also in Vasistha Yama, Parāśara and Baudbāyana and the 2nd in Paithinasi also and they do occur in the printed Vas. (III. 5-6). In Br. K. p. 181 he quotes the verse 'savyāhạtim... prāņāyāmah sa ucyate' as occurring in Sankha, Vasistha, Angiras, Brhaspati, Paithīnasi and Baudhāyana and it does occur in Vas. VII. 14 ( Anandāśrama collection ). On p. 742 of Vyavahārakānda and p. 432 of Grhastha K. he quotes the verse 'putrena lokān...vistapam'as occurring in Manu, Sankhalikhita, Visuu, Vasistha and Hārīta and it does occur in Visnu, Dh. S. 15. 45, Vas. 17. 5 and also in Manu IX. 137 and Baud. Dh. S. II, 9.6. On pp. 36-37 of Vyavabāra K. he

quotes three verses, the first of which L. states occurs in Manu, Nārada, IIārīta and Baudhayana. All three occur in Manu VIII. 18, 19 and 14 and all three in Nárada III, 8, 12, 13 p. 43 (Dr. Jolly's ed. in B. I. Series ) and the first in Baud Dh. S. I. 10. 30. Such illustrations lead one to con clude that L, had collected a large number of the mss of Smộtis and had directed his pandits to make an exhaustive concordance of smrti verses. 
On pp. 174-175 of his work Aparărka quotes a long extract from Devala in prose and verse on Dosas', which exhibits striking skill in defining several words. On Yāj. III. 109 ( pp. 986-988) Aparārka quotes a very long prose passage from Devala (a small portion of which also occurs in the Moksakānda of Kalpataru pp. 100-101. Aparārka sets out at length ( in prose) the purport of about two dozen verses of the Sānkhyakārikã, while the Moksakānda (pp. 100-101 ) contains less than half of what Aparărka says (practically in the same words as those of Aparārka. It should be further noticed that in the Moksakānda there is another long prose passage begiuning with the words 'Atha mūlaprakstir avyaktam' (p. 100 last six lines and on p. 101 1. 14 ) ending with the words 'ityutpattikramah' which is part of the passage cited in Aparārka pp. 987-88 (which adds some words not found in the Moksa-kānda ) 'yo yasmād-utpadyate....... sa tasmin liyata iti vāpyayakramaḥ'. Another very signi ficant circumstance is that the long passage from Devala extending to about two pages in Aparărka is followed by five verses of Yama on the Sankhya system, which also occur in Moksakāndla (pr. 101-102 ) with one slight change in the last verse. 
From the close agreement between passages of Devala in both Aparārka and Moksakānda with some omissions in the latter, it appears to the present author that the author of the Mokşakānda used a ms. of Aparărka's work (in which there was probably no demarcation of clauses and which was also slightly defective ) and the editor of the Moksakında committed mistakes in separating the clauses. 
One remarkable circumstance bearing on the relative chronological positions of the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru may be noted here.

79. Jimītavāhana 
699 
The Hāralată of Aniruddhabhatta was composed about 1160 to 1170 A. D., as he was the 147 and Dharmādhyaksa of king Ballālasena of Bengal, who composed his Dānasāgara in Saka 1091 (1169–70 A. 1. ). Two works viz. Kāmdhenu and Kalpataru were composed in the realm of the Gáhadwāla King Govindacandra. The Hāralată mentions the Kāmadhenu several times as an authority of the same weight as Visvarūpa, Bhojadeva, and Govindarāja (vide pp. 41, 117, 174 of the Häralatā ); while the vast digest of Kalpataru of Laksmi dhara is not mentioned even once anywhere by the Hāralatā. If the Kāmadhenu, disdainfully spoken of by Laksmīdhara, could penetrate to Bengal before 1160-70 A. D. and be treat ed there as a work of authority, it is very surprising that the Kalpataru backed by the glamorous career of the great Minister Laksmidhara and dealing at length with the same topics as those treated of in the Hāralatā should not have been referred to even once in the Hăralatā. 
This leads to the conclusion that portions of the Kalpa taru were composed decades later than the time when the Kāmadhenu was composed and earlier than 1160 A. D. only by a decade or so. 
79. Jimutavahana 
Jimutavāhana is the first of the triumvirate of Bengal writers on dharmuśwstra, the other two being Sūlapāņi and Raghunandana. Only three works of his are known and they have all been printed viz: the Kālaviveka (B. I. series, 1905), the Vyavahāramātrkā (published in the memoirs of the Bengal Asiatic Society, vol. III., No. 5, pp. 277-353, edited by the late Şir Asutosh Mukerji), the Dāyabhāga (published several times ). It appears that these works were intended to form part of a vast treatise on dharmaśāstra called Dharma ratna, as stated in the Kālaviveka.989 In this work I have used the edition of the Dāyabhāga printed in 1829.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Kālaviveka as its name implies contains discussions as to the appropriate seasons, months and times for the perfor. mance of religious rites and duties, the determination of inter calary months, the question whether the month for certain festivals and rites, was to be solar or luuar, the proper time for the cessasion and starting of Vedic studies ( Utsarjana and Upākarma ), the rise of Agastya, the four months during which Visnu was supposed to sleep on the ocean, the times for various festivals including the kojāguru and the Durgot sava, the eclipses. The work is named Kalaviveka not only in the colophon, but also in the body itself.990 Some of the sections of the work also are styled riveku (e. . Amāvāsyā viveka pp. 351-365, dvirāsādhaviveka pp. 169-174). The object with which the work was composed is stated in the 2nd verse991 as follows :—'kāla' (the topic of proper times for religious duties ) has not been understood by some writers; it has been based upon ancient texts and compressed into narrow compass by others; therefore it is dealt with by me in such a way as to be easily unilerstood even by dull-witted persons. M. M. Chakravarti (JASB 1915 p. 314 ) draws from this the conclusion that 'no previous treatise specially dealing with Kāla alone was known to the author'. This is not a sound conclusion. All that Jimutavāhana claims is that he has made the subject of Kāla extremely easy. As a matter of fact in one verse he brings together seven predecessorg982 who expatiated on Kūla and whose works have become worth little on account of the appearance of the Kāla viveka. As long as the works of all these writers are not recovered it is impo ssible to assert that Jimūta vāhana had before him no previous work dealing specially with Kálıb. Besides the astronomical and astrological works of ancient writers such as those of Varābamibira and Brahmagupta, the ancient smộtis and purāuas, the important works and authors mentioned are ---- - - - - - --

enumerated in the note below.993_Most of these nibandhcs kāras are quoted by him in his two other works also.

But Yogiśvara in the Jit. is probably a misprint or copyist's error for Dhāreśvara as some Mss. read Dhāreśvara. In the Kālaviveka Jimūtavāhana makes frequent and effective use of Purvamīmāṁsā maxims996 and shows that he had made a profound study of that system.

quoted in the Srāddhacintāmani of Vācaspati, in the Srāddha kaumudi (p. 328 ) and Varsakriya-kaumudi of Govindānanda and in several Tattvas of Raghunandana, e. g. (Vol. I) Tithi 141, 144, Ābnika 341, Malao 834, (Vol. II ) Ekādaśī 41, 46, 87 ( ed. of 1895 ). 
The Vyavahāramātrkā as its very name implies deals with the elements of vyavahara (i. e. judicial procedure ). It speaks of the eighteen titles of law, the derivation of the word prādviváka (judge ), the persons fit to be appointed judges, different grades of courts, duties of sabhyas, four stages of vya rahāra, pūrvapaksa (plaint ), pratibhū ( surety ), blemishes in a plaint, uttara (reply of the defendent), four kinds of uttara, blemishes in uttarai, kriyā (proof or burden of proof), divine (duivi) and human : mānusi ) proof ( viz. : ordeals, inference, witnesses, documents, possession), persons incompetent to be witnesses. Ordeals have not been dealt with by the author. The first verse of the work 998 styles it Vyavahára mātrkā. The last verse 099 but one suggests the name Nyayamātņkā which practically is a synonym of Vyavahára-mātrkā and the colophon at the end of a ms. in the Govt. Mss. library at the B.O.R. Institute calls it Nyāya ratnamālikā. 
About twenty smrtikāras 1000 are mentioned in the Vyavaháramātrkā. Kātyāyana, Brhaspati and Nārada are the three smrtikāras most frequently quoted, nearly two-thirds of the quotations in the entire work being derived from them. Among the nibanrlhukūrus the following are named : Jitendriya, Diksita, (p. 302), Bala (p. 346, the same ag

Balaka), Bhojadeva (pp. 284, 305), Mañjarīkāra (i, e. Govindarāja ), Yogloka, Viśvarūpa, Srikara (pp. 292, 334 or Srikaramisra p. 342). About Viśvarūpa he says 1001 "I have put forward this conclusion of the ancient writers, I have refuted the objections of Viśvarūpa and others and dealt with them at length’ Yogloka and Srikara are generally quoted for being refuted and the former is frequently jeered at as 'tārki kaṁmanya' or 'nava-tārkikam-manya’. In this work Jimūta vāhana displays great familiarity with the ancient dialectics. In some cases what the printed text exhibits 1002 as prose really constitutes verses. Sir Asutosb Mukerji is not accurate when he says in the preface that Jimūtavāhana refers to a number of jurists not mentioned by any other author, e.g. Jitendriya, Yogloka, Bălaka, Viśvarūpa, Srikara and Mañjarīkāra'. It has been shown above that both Viśvarūpa and Srīkara have been mentioned by the Mit. which is certainly earlier than Jimūtavāhana and by a host of other writers who were either earlier than or contemporaries of Jimītavāhana. The Vyava hāramātrkā is quoted in the Vyavabăratattva 1003 (pp. 199, 214, 225 vol. II.) and the Dāyatattva p. 179 and Divyatattva pp. 586, 583. 
The Dāyabhāga is the most famous of Jimutavābana's works. In matters of Hindu law such as inheritance, partition strīdhana, re-union, it is of jaramount authority in modern British Indian courts in Bengal, except in those cases where

the Mităksarā is applicable. The names of more than a dozen commentators of it are known and Pandit Bharatacandra Siromani published it with seven commentaries (1863-1866). It was translated into English by Colebrooke. In many editions (such as that of Jivananda) it is divided into sections though there were no divisions in the original work. The contents of the Dáyabhāga are:- Definition of daya ; father's power over ancestral property; partition of father's and grand father's property; division among brothers after their father's death, definition, classification and devolution of stridhann; persons excluded from inheritance and partition on the ground of disabilities; property which is impartible (in its very nature or because it is self-acquired ); order of succession to one dying sonless; re-union, partition of coparcenery property concealed but discovered afterwards, indicia of partition. 
Some of the peculiar doctrines of the Dāyabhāya which are of fundamental importance and which sharply distinguish it from the Mit. are: sons have no interest in ancestral pro perty by birth, sons can claim partition only after extinction of their father's ownership (i, e. after his death or on his becoming patitu or a sinyasin) or partition can take place between father and sons if the father so desires, a widow succeeds to her husband's interest on his death even if he be joint with his brother, the right to take a deceasel person's estate is regulated by the spiritual benefit conferred by the person claiming as heir ( by means of the offering of pindas ) and not by the principal of consanguinity (as in the Mit. ). 100+ 
It should be noted by all Hindus that the Hindu Succession Act (Act No. 30 of 1956 ) passed by the parliament of India has made substantial changes in the law laid down both by Jimūtavāhana and the Mitāksarā as regards parti tion, succession and kindred matters.

The foot-note on this paragraph avers that one called * piravadyavidyoddyota’ (lit. one who possesses the brilliance of spotless vidyās) put forward that the guiding principle in preference among heirs is the spiritual benefit that the heir will confer on the deceased. It is remarkable that in the Harsacarita (first Ucchavāsa, last paragraph ) we have a statement that Bāņa resorted to gurukulas that were radiant with spotless learning (niravadya-vidyāvidyotapāni ca kulāni sevamanah). The word also occurs in the Dayabhāga before the passage quoted from Yājñavalkya II. 122 ( bhūryā pitanahopättà........cobhayoh ) in chap. II section 9 of the Dåyabhāga, where the explanation of this verse by Niravadyavidyota 'is cited (which is in direct conflict with that of the Mitakşară). That expression in the Dayabhāga may be explained in several ways: (1) Udyota is the name of a person whose learning was blameless. Pan. III, 1. 101 tells us that'avadya 'means “garhya'(deserving to be censured ). Śrinātha ( 1470-1540 ) and Mabesvara take it in that sense. Other commentators take it as a title or distinction conferred on the man and hold that Udyota means refulgence. 
Besides the smrtikāras,105 the Mahābhārata and the Markandeyapurāņa the following authors are referred to by Dame in Dàyabhāga :- Udgrahamalla, Govindaraja (an author of Manutikā ), Jitendriya, Dikșita, Balaka, Bhojadeva or Dhåreśvara, Visvarūpa and Srikara. 
The word “Udgrähamalla' is taken by the commentators as not being a proper name, but as a common noun meaning ' a disputant that takes up the position opposed to the one advanced by the author'; e. g. most commentators say that * Udgrāha' means simply "våda' and explain · udgråho vàdaḥ sa eva mallah' and some like Srikrsna Tarkalankara say ' udgràho vādaḥ tatra mallasya samarthasya galahastavan nivārakaḥ ityarthaḥ.' They do not quote any kośa to support their meaning of. udgråha' as 'vāda'. Udgrāhamalla may be a proper noun just as we have Todaramalla among authors on Dharmaśāstra and as the word ends in malla' (a gymnast ) the

author naturally gives a reply in gymnastic terms that a verse of Devala would completely vanquish (lit. throttle ) him. It may be noted that Maheśvara ( a commentator ) holds that Udgra hamalla is the name of a Smộti writer. The present author does not say that the meaning proposed by commentators is quite wrong or impossible, but holds that the meaning proposed by him appears to be the proper one. Panini has a special sátra udi grahaḥ' III, 3. 35 for the word care. 
In the Dayabhàga Jimütavahana quotes among Smrti sages Manu ( most frequently ), Nārada, Yajñavalkya, Bșhaspati, Kātyāyana, Vişnu, Gautama, Vasistha, Harita, Baudhāyana, Brhanmanu, Vyāsa, Sankhalikhita, Devala, Yama, Uśanas, VỊddha-kātyāyana, Ápastamba, Viddha-śătatapa, Paithinasi. Among the Purāņas, the Mārkandeyapurāņa (XI. 40 ) alone is quoted by name in the Dayabhäga. 
The Nibandhakāras mentioned by name in the Dayabhāga are, besides Niravadyavidyoddyota, Jitendriya ( thrice mentioned ), Govindarāja, Dbāreśvara Bhojadeva, Diksita (only a title ), Bāla or Bàlaka ( m. five times ), Viśvarúpa (m. thrice ) and Srikara (m. five times, once as Srikaramiśra). Udgrābamalla1006 is referred to on the distribution of stridhana and it is said that Udgrāhamalla (i.e. his view ) is throttled by the text of Devala. It appears, therefore, that Udgrahamalla was not a smsti writer, but a nibandhakära. Diksita10c7 is credited with the view that, among daughters, those who have sons or are likely to have sons are preferred to those who are either barren, widowed or who give birth to daughters alone and the Dāyabhāga approves of this view, There is one more writer who is referred to twice with great respect as Niravadyavidyoddyota. Whether this is a mere descrip tion or title ('the refulgence of whose learning is spotless') or

whether the author's name was Uddyota and niravadyavidya (whose learning in spotless') is an epithet, it is difficult to say. For a correct knowledge of the origin and development of the theory of spiritual benefit propounded in the Dayabhāga, it would be extremely desirable to know who this writer was, as Jìmütavahana tells us that that view was brilliantly set forth by Niravadyavidyoddyota. The same writer is also quoted on the well-known verse of Yājñavalkya 'bhāryā pitämahopätta &c.,' which is the sheet-anchor of Vijñāne śvara's theory about the son's rights by birth in ancestral family property. 100 
Jimūtavāhana gives very little information about himself. In the colophons of his works he is described as Pàribhadriya Mahamahopadhyāya and at the end of the Vyavahāramàtřkā ( vide note 999 above ) he tells us that he was born of the Paribhadra family (kula).1009 It is said that this name of the family still survives in the Parihal or Pāri Gai, a section of Radhiya Brāhmaṇas (Ghose's Hindu Law, 3rd edition, pp. XVI-XVIII and JASB 1915 p. 320). It is also said that Edu miśra in his Kulakārikā tells us that Jimātavāhana was chief judge in the reign of Vişvak-sena of Bengal and that he was 9th in descent from Nåràyarabhatta, one of the five Brāhmaṇas brought by Adis. ra. The information supplied by the match-makers of Bengal is, as shown above ( vide pp. 632–33 above under Halāyudha), not worth reliance, unless corroborated by independent evidence. It is also said that for fourteen genera tions the Bråbmaņas of Parigrāma have been degraded and so Jimatavahana would not have paraded the fact that he was Paribhadriya if at the time when he wrote his subcaste bad been degraded (Intro. to Kālaviveka p. VIII). The fact that Jimätavahana was a native of Ràdha is testified by his statement in the Kālaviveka that Agastya ( Canopus ) rose in Vijayini when

four days of the month of Bhadrapada remained, but that in Rādhā Agastya rose when seven days of the month were yet to run.1010 
Extremely divergent views have been held as to the date of Jimutavahana. He has been assigned to various dates from the 11th to the 16th century. In L. R. 41 I. A. at p. 298 it is said by their Lordships of the Privy Council that the Mit. was carlier by five centuries than Jimütavāhana. Dr. Jolly (R. u, S. p. 37) assigns him to the 15th century. For a statement of the various dates and their examination the article of M. M. Chakravarti in JASB for 1915, pp. 321-327 and Mr. Panchanan Ghosh's learned article in 26 Calcutta Law Journal (journal portion p. 17. ff.) may be consulted. Since Jimatavahana mentions Dhāreśvara Bhojadeva and Govindaraja, he cannot be placed earlier than the last quarter of the 11th century. Since he is quoted by Sulapāņi, Vacaspati-miśra and Raghunandana, hc cannot be later than the middle of the 15th century. The Kala viveka furnishes important data. On a ms. of the Kalaviveka there is a note made about the birth-date of the son of a certain Ghatakasimha with the horoscope of the child. The year speci fied therein is šake 1417, i. e. 1495 A. D. It follows from this that the Ms. itself must have been copied sometime before this and the original work must be much earlier still. So the Kala viveka cannot be placed at any rate later than about 1400 A. D. 
In the Kālaviveka Jimütavāhana tells us that his predecessor Andhuka1011 exhibited a certain astronomical matter in sake 952 (i. e. 1030 A. D.) and that he declared an intercalary month in sake 955. 
Similarly Jimūtavahana expatiates upon several1012 minute astronomical and astrological details which were observed in

the sake years 1013 and 1014 (i. e. 1091 and 1092 A. D.). It is impossible to suppose that an author would enter into such minute details about a time which was anterior to his own by centuries. Generally astronomical works take for their calcula - tions starting points or years which were within their own experience or very nearly so. Therefore it appears to be a sound conclusion to hold that the Kalaviveka was composed soon aftes sake 1013 or 1014 (i, e. 1091 and 1092 A. D.). Hence it follows that the literary activity of Jjm itavahana lay between 1090 and 1130 A. D. The Kalaviveka seems to be his first work. The Vyavahāramātļkā would naturally come before the Dayabhāga. He seems to have contemplated writing 1013 on rnadına also, as he says in the Dayabhāga that a certain matter would be expound ed by him in ļņādāna. 
The most cogent argument that can be advanced against the above early date assigned to Jimatavāhana is that neither Jimataváhana nor any of his compositions is mentioned by Bengal writers and works on Dharmaśāstra belonging to the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries such as the Häralatā, the commentary of Kullūka etc. No satisfactory explanation can be offered of this silence. But it is a very precarious thing to conclude from this silence that Jimùtavahana's works did not exist during those centuries. It is safer to base conclusions about his date on the positive evidence contained in his works rather than rely upon the negative argument from silence in later works. When some of his commentators say that he criticises the views of Capdeśvara, Miśra and others we should not take them seriously. The commentators had no idea of the exact chronological position of writers long anterior to them. All they mean is that Jimutavā. hana criticises views that were shared also by Candeśvara and others. Another important question is whether Jimätavāhana who is certainly a little later than the Mit. criticizes it. The

Vivada-tandava of1014 Kamalakara says that Jimutavahana held that the view about the equal ownership of father and son in ancestral property was put forward for precluding the possibility of the uncle taking the whole estate of a man dying (in union) leaving a son or a predeceased son's son or for precluding the possibility of an unequal distribution of ancestral property by a father among his sons and that Jimütavahana took up this position, being blinded by his hatred of the Mit. The Vira mitrodayal015 also says that Jimātavāhana criticizes the Mitàksarā definition of vibhāga and the view of the Mit. about the times for partition. The Vyavahāramātřka 1016 also appears to criticize several times views which were held by the Mit. and the correspondence is very striking. On this point this much may be said that the points selected for attack by Jimūtavahana do occur almost in the same words in the Mit. but, since the Mit. is not expressly mentioned and since it is likely that other writers like Asahāya and Bharuci whose works have not yet been discovered might have contained the very same words that are found in the Mit., it is somewhat hazardous to assert that Jimútavábana criticizes the Mit. alone and no other work. All that one can advance is that it is quite within the bounds of possibility that Jimütavāhana criticizes the Mit. 
Raghunandana in his Smộtitattva differs rather rarely from Jimātavahana; vide (Vol. I.) Tithitattva pp. 52-53, Malamasa

He quotes Käldviveka frequently e. g. in Tithi pp. 106, 107, 141, 144, Malap.834, Ekādasi pp.41,87; he mentions the Vyavahāramātsaka in Vya, tattva pp. 199, 214, 225, the Dāyabhāga in Dayatattva pp. 164, 174, 194. He names Jimatavāhana frequently as in Vol. I Tithi pp. 24, 144, Prāyaścitta p. 482, Malao pp. 767, 781; ( Vol. II.) Dāyatattva p. 194, Eka dasi pp. 5, 36, 38, 40, 51, 53, 103. 
Several commentaries on the Dāyabhāga have been published. The more important commentators are (1) Srinatha Ácāryacudā maņi, Guru of Raghunandana2017 ( flourished about 1470-1540 A. D.); vide JASB ( New Series ) vol. XI. pp. 344–351 for his parentage, works and time of Srinātha; (2) Ramabhadra Nyàyā lankāra Bhattācārya, son of Srinatha-Acāryacūdāmaņi ( flourished about 1510-1570. Vide for his commentary 'Our Heritage' vol. VI. pt. I pp 43-53; 1. H. Q. vol. 33; (3) Acyutānanda Cakraviartin (flourished about 1510-i570); (4) Mahesvarabhattācārya (about 1530–1600); (5) Srikrsna Tarkàlankāra (flourished about the middle of the 18th century ). 
There is a commentary on the Dāyabhàga professed by Raghunandana. Colebrooke suspected that it was not a work of Raghunandana. Rai Bahadur Manmohan Chakravarti holds that it is Raghunandana's (J. A. S. B. vol. XI, N. S. for 1915, pp. 302, 352), on the ground that the final colophon gives the kula as Vandyaghatiya and the father's name as Hariharabhattācārya. This is not a very strong ground. Any scholar desirous of passing off his own work as Raghunandana's could very easily have put in these items. It was included among the commentaries on the

Following the dictum in a well-known verse BTTHATH Itafa ATATTET I Flat a Taytaut: 11 Raghuna dana does not mention his guru's name in the discussions. In the Smrtitattva Raghunandana frequently mentions his teacher's views with the words "iti Gurucaraụāl'. Vide for example, (vol. I) Tithi pp. 31, 85, Malao p. 769, Sainskāra p. 873, ( vol. II ) Ekadasī pp. 5, 103. In two places of the Yajurvediśrāddbatattva (vol. II, pp. 493 and 500) he mentions the Śrāddha-Candrikā of his guru and in the Yajurvedi-vpsotsargatattva (vol. II, p. 640 ) he mentions 
• Ācārya-cüdāmaņi' along with Hariśvara, Pasupati and Rāmadatta.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Dāyabhāga publiched by Pandit Bharatacandrasiromani in his edition of the Dayabhiga with commentaries. It is very likely that Raghunandana worte a commentary on the Dayabhāga. Unless strong grounds are shown to doubt the authorship of Raghunandana, we may concede that he wrote it. 
On Jimütavāhana, his work and tiines one may read with profit Rai Bahadur Manmohan Chakravarti's learned contri butions to the History of Smộti in Bengal and Mithila' in J. A. S. B. ( New Series) Vol. XI (pub. in 1916 ) pp. 311-327. 
As to Jim tavāhana's time there is a sharp divergence of views among scholars. Simutavahana mentions Dhåreśvara Bhojadeva in his three works and Govindarāja in the Dayabhàga (XI. 2.22–23. Jiv. ed. 1893). Vide above under Govindarāja ( p.657 n. 897a.). Therefore he cannot be placed earlier than about 1125 A. D. The divergence of views among scholars concerns the latest date to which he is to be assigned. M. M. Chakravarti (J.A.S.B. vol. XI. pp. 322-324 ) points out that the Kalaviveka of Jsmūtavahana is quoted in the Durgotsavaviveka of Salapāņi and therefore Jimütavahana cannot be placed later than the end of the 14th century A. D. Another argument for an early date is supplied by the astronomical references in the Kalaviveka. It may be noted that in the Kālaviveka (the earliest of his three works ) he refers to the rising of the star Agastya (Canopus) in his own day in his homeland in Ràdhā and in Ujjayini. He says1018 “the rising of Canopus takes place on different days according to the country (in which an observer resides ); to illustrate, that star is first seen in Rådhå when seven days are yet to run of the month of Bhadrapada, while in Ujjayini it rises when only four days of Bhadrapada are yet to run; again he notes that Agastya is seen rising in Ujjayini when twenty-six days of Leo have passed away and in Radhă, Canopus is first seen rising when twenty-three days of the sign of Leo are past. Here it is clear that he is referring to the appearance of heavenly bodies in his own day. In other

passages of the Kālaviveka, where there are astronomical referen ces to heavenly bodies we should presume that he refers to what he himself saw or knew personally (unless there are clear indica. tions to the contrary in the passage itself or near it). For example, he refers to the eighth day after the Sun's entering in Tula ( Libra ) in the Saka year 1014 (i. e. 1092 A. D.) and the seventeenth day after the Sun entered the sign of Tulă in the year 1013 (i. e. 1091 A. D.). Probably these dates may refer to his boyhood or youth.101sa

On the smộti of Yajñavalkya Aparāditya wrote a volumin ous commentary styled Apararka-Yajnavalkiya-dharmasastra. nibandha (published in two volumes by the Anandàśrama Press, Poona, 1903 and 1904). In a verse1018 at the end and in the colophons the author is called Aparāditya, a Silāhāra king, born in the family of Jimutavāhana of the Vidyadhara race. In the introductoryl020 fifth verse also the author is styled an ornament of the family of Jimūta' and is highly eulogised for his devotion to Siva and his brilliant intellect. 
The Silāhāras bad a long history for several centuries in India, roughly between the Tāpi river and parts of Goa and pre sent Mysore. There were three main branches, but as they were

feudatories and did not aspire to imperial title, they were generally referred to as “Mahamandalesvara' and did not rule over extensive territories. The late Professor A. S. Altekar contributed an exhaustive paper on the silāhāras to the Indian Culture (Vol. II for 1935-36, pp. 393-428 ) with a list of Silāhåra Inscrip tions on pp. 43-4330). Here only a brief account will be set out. One branch of Silāhāras ruled over North Konkan from about 800 A. D. to about 1265 A. D. A number of copper plates and Inscriptions on stone of this branch had been published when Dr. Altekar wrote. The pedigree begins with Kapardin ( 800-825 A. D.) and ends with Someśvara (1240–1265 A. D.). This branch ruled over parts of what is now Surat district and over the present districts of Thana, Alibag and parts of the Ratnagiri District, their capitais being Thana and Purī. Vide 1. C. vol. II. p. 402 for a complete genealogy of this line and their chronology. There were two kings in this branch called Aparārka (I in about 1110-1140 A. D.) and Aparārka or Aparāditya (II in 1170–1195 A. D.). The most important records of this branch ( with which alone we are concerned when dealing with Aparărka as a commentator on Yaj.) are those in J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. XXI pp. 505-16, ed. by Prof. K. B. Pathak of the year Śake 1049 ( 1127 A. D.) and in A. B. O. R. I. vol. V. pp. 169–70 edited by Mr. Diskalkar. 1091 About 29 plates and inscriptions of this branch are set out by Prof. Altekar(1. C vol. II on pp. 430-32 ) and on p. 402 of the same the names of all the kings of this branch with dates are mentioned. The two other branches were (I) of the Silahāras of South Konkan as in E. I. Vol. III. pp. 292-302 ( the Kharepatan plates of Rattaraja of Sake 930, 1008 A. D.); (2) and the other ruling over terri tories of what are now parts of Satara and Belgaum Districts and the State of Kolhapur (vide E. I. vol. III pp. 207-216 of sake 1065 i. e. 1143 A. D.). There is no Aparāditya in both these branches. The Silāhāras describe themselves as Tagarapuravaràdhi śvara. Greek writers like Ptolemy located Tagara to the north cast of Paithan. Dr. Fleet (JRAS vol. IV p. 281 ) conjectures that it is Ter, a place about 95 miles South-East of Paithan.

This inscription comes from Somnāth in Kathiawad and hence it is dated in Vikraua year 1176 (i, e, Caitra suddha 14 Sunday 1119–20 A, D.) and the grant is of a Vātikā ( modern Vāki in sthānakiya-pātana i. e. in Tbana by a mahāmālya Lakşmañanāyaka, son of Bhāskaranäyaka

The most relevant documents for our purpose are those of Aparārka or Aparāditya (literally the Sun of the Western direc tion). The name of the family is variously spelt in the Inscripti ons viz. as Silāhāra, śālàr, Siyalar, Selar. There is a place called Šelārvādi near Poona. The first name is rather ancient. It occurs in the Sanskrit drama called Någānanda composed by the famous Emperor Harşadeva (first half of 7th century A. D.). The name was taken to mean 'who offered himself as food on a stone-slab'. The drama is based on the legend that Jimātavāhana, son of Jimůtaketu, offered himself as prey to Garuda who used to devour every day a nāga on a stone-slab. The drama describes Goddess Gauri (consort of Siva ) to be the patroness of Vidyadharas, from whom was descended Jjmůtavāhana. The colophons at the end of the three sections of the Yājāavalkyasmrti mention this legendary matter. It is noteworthy that in the Akalkot Inscrip tion of Silāhāra Indrarasa (E. I. vol. 27, p. 63 ) it is pointed out by the editor of the record that there are no doubt three well known branches of Silāhāras but there are seven other branches also. 
As regards Aparàrka there are the grants in ABORI vol. V p. 169, the Vadavali grant of Sake 1049 ( 1127-28 A. D.), and JBBRAS vol. XXI, pp. 506-517. 
Aparārka's work, like the Mitàksarā, though professedly a commentary on Yāj., is really in the nature of a digest. It is far more voluminous than the Mit. It quotes profusely from the Gshya and Dharmasūtras and the metrical smstis. Several features distinguish it from the Mit. The Mit. is generally very chary of quoting from the Puràņas, while Aparārka contains long extracts sometimes extending over pages from several Purānas, viz. the Adipurāņa, the Adityapurāņa, the Kūrma, the Kālikāpurāna, Devi, Nandi, Nțsimha, Padma, Brahma, Brahmanda, Bhavisyat, Bhavisyottara, Matsya, Märkandeya, Linga, Varāha, Vámana, Väyu, Vişnu, Visņudharmottara, Siva dharmottara, Skanda. From the Puranas liundreds of verses are cited. The Vamana on pp. 364-365 on special gifts in the twelve months from Mágha and Sivadharmottra (p. 274) are quoted only once and the Kurma and Linga are quoted only thrice each, but about four hundred verses are quoted from the Matsyapurana alone, about 160 from the Brahmapurāņa, about 100 from the Bha 
716 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
visyat and so on. The index at the end of the printed Aparàrka gives the names of the various smstikáras quoted in the work. Another feature not found in the Mit, is that Aparārka quotes long passages of the Dharmasūtras and explains them at length, e. g. on Yäj. III. 294 (p. 1205 ) he quotes Gautama ( Dh. S. 20. 2-9) and then offers a lengthy explanation ; on Yāj. III. 294–295, he quotes long passages of Vasistha (Dh. S. 15. 11-14 and 17-21) and gives datailed explanations of them. It is probable he had not before him commentaries on these dharmasútras. Several hundred verses are quoted from the Manusmrti. The Dharma sutras of Apastamba, Gautama, Vasiştha, Vişnu, Bodhāyana, Devala, Paițhinasi, Sankha, Sankhalikbita and Hārita are profu sely quoted. Similarly, Nārada, Bșhaspati and Katyāyana, Parāśara, Yama (quoted over 100 times mostly on ācāra and prayascitta sections) are quoted profusely. It appears from the way that Sankha and Sarkhalikhita are quoted that Aparārka had before him two separate works, one of Sankha (in which sotras and verses occur almost in equal numbers ) and of Sarkhalikhita in which prose passages vastly predominate and verses occur rarely. In the 99 references to pages where Sankha is mentioned he is quoted in prose on pp. 118, 119, 123, 150, 156, 249, 260, 262-63, 274, 694, 717, 718, 741, 842, 875, 882, 944, 1025, 1057, 1066, 1077, 1089, 1094, 1117, 1121, 1148, 1153, 1154, 1158, 1175, 1210, 1241. Sankha-Likhitau are mentioned about 63 times, but verses are rare. On p. 224 there is a quotation from sankhalikhitau in which there is a verse first, followed by a prose passage. On p. 896 at first there is a verse passage ( 14 verses ) followed by a prose extract on the same topic. On p. 1149 there is a prose passage of Sankhalikhita followed by a half verse attributed to Sankha. On p. 1154.1022 there is a passage of Sankha followed by another prose from Sankhalikhita ( the first word being the same in both). There are similar cases where Sankhalikhitau are quoted and then Sankha is quoted or vice versa on the same matter ( vide note below ).10224 I collected about 40 years ago passages

It is remarkable that Aparārka names twelve Smstikāras with the prefix vrddha' viz. Gargya, Gautama, Parasara, Para sara, Pracetas, Brhaspati, Manu ( 24 times), Yajnavalkya (ten times ), Vasistha ( 16 times), Vyasa, Satatapa ( 19 times,) and Harita ( twice). He also quotes Laghu-Yama, Laghu-Visnu and Laghu-Harita (9 times); and also Brhat-Pracetas (thrice), Brhad-yama (once), Brhan-Manu (once) and Brhad-Visnu(thrice ). About eighty verses are expressly quoted from the Mahābhārata and only seven from the Ramayana (one on p. 385, two on p.875 and four on p. 881 ). On p. 11 he gives brief summaries in the style of the Sankarabhāşya of the tenets of the Saiva, Pasupata, Pañcarátra, Sankhya and Yoga systems. In one place he sets out the arguments of those who hold that correct knowledge alone leads to mok sa and of those who hold that a combination of correct knowledge and works is essential for moksa and leaves his readers to choose for themselves whatever view they take.1083 It is remarkable that, while even the Mit. names at

History of Dharmaśāstra 
least six nibandhakāras on dharmaśāstra viz. Asahāya, Visvarūpa, Bhāruci, Srikara, Medhàtithi and Dhāreśvara. Aparırka observes a studied silence in the matter of citing the names of his prede cessors. He employs such vague expressions as kecit, anye, apare, though he cites views that were ascribed by the Mit. and others to Dhåreśvara and others, e. g. on pp. 741-42 he says1024 that the text of Yāj. "patni duhitaraḥ' according to some refers to the widow who submits to niyoga (this is the view of Dhāreśvara); on p. 744 he refers to the view of some that the word duhitr in Yaj. means only the appointed daughter (putrikā). This last was the view of Višvarūpa and Srikara. On p. 761 he refers to the reading of some in Yāj. II. 150 as 'sāmantā sthavirā gaņāḥ' which is found in Viśvarūpa (II. 154) and not in the Mit. Aparårka pames (p. 926 ) a Vågblaţa-smộtisamgraha and a Smrti. mīmāṁsă of Jaimini ( p. 206 ) from which two verses are quoted, variant readings therein are noticed and detailed explanations thereof are offered. He refers to several works and authors on astronomy and astrology such as Garga, Kriyāśraya (p. 872), Sárávali. On pp. 570 and 572 of the printed text occur two references to a pustaka of Rājánaka Sitikaptha.1025 That was probably a marginal note in a mis., the copyist or owner of which found on comparison with another ms. belonging to Rājānaka Siti kantha additional matter. Aparàrka quotes from Bhatta (i. e. Kumārilabhatta ).1026 Aparărka does not appeal as frequently to the doctrines of the Pûrvamimams, as the Mit. does and he does not generally enter into acute discussions of Pūrvamimāṁsā in its application to Dharmasastra as the Mit. does. Here and there he mentions a few terms that are often employed in Pūrvamimāṁsā discussions, e. g. on p. 470 on Yāj. I. 226–228 he employs the words “aupadesika' and atideóika.' Similarly, on Yaj. I. 260 (on Trayodasiśraddha in the rainy season ) he enters upon a discussion of the terms 'prasajyapratiședha' and 
• paryudasa'. On Yāj. III. 243 he quotes the Nyāya . sarvasākhả

But such references to Mimăssă and nyāyas are rare in Aparărka's work. For explanation of 'prasajyapratisedha' and 'paryudása ', vide H. of Dh. vol. V. pp. 1247–49 and foot-notes 2027-2030 and for Ātidesika and Aupadesika' vide H. of Dh. vol. V. pp. 1321-23 and note 2173. It must be said that Aparārka is much inferior to the Mit. in lucid exposition, in dialectic skill, in subtlety of argu ment and in the ordered presentation of heterogenous material. 
Some of the views that are usually associated with Jimutaváhana were propounded by Aparārka also. Aparārka bases the right to take a deceased person's property on the superior spiritual benefit conferred by the claimant on the person deceased.1027 In several other respects also Aparàrka differs from the Mit., though in general the two closely agree. For example, Aparărka prefers the father over the mother as an heir (p. 745); Apararka explains the word apratisthità' in Gautama's text ( 18. 22 ) as one who is issueless or is indigent or a widow,' while the Mit. explains it to mean only indigent.' 
Whether Aparàrka knew the Mit. is a vexed question. Some scholars, while holding that Aparàrka does criticize the Mit., ex plain away the non-mention of the Mit. by saying that the Indian etiquette required a royal author not to mention the name of the servant of another king, while the existence of the master himself was ignored (Dr. Jolly in Journal of Indian History, vol. III. p.17). It is doubtful whether any such etiquette ever existed and further Aparàrka studiously avoids the express mention of every ancient commentator. Works of royal authors, such as the Madana på rijăta or the Sarasvativilása, do not appear to have followed the etiquette if it ever existed. Besides, Vijñānesvara was a Parivrăjaka

( sannyasin) and not the servant of any king. In my opinion the Mit. was known to Aparārka. Aparārka reads Yāj. III. 17 as * Vaitānopāsanāḥ káryāḥ kriyāśca sruticoditāḥ,' explains the first word as a karmadháraya compound, gives the explanation of this verse offered by others, disapproves of it and then says that others read - Sruticodanat' for 'sruticoditah'.1023 Visvarupa reads ' vaitanikāsrayah... srutidarsanat' and offers no comment on this verse beyond the word 'spastirthametat' (it is III. 15 in the Trivandrum ed.). The Mit. does contain the reading referred to by Apararka and the Sruti passage 'yavaj-jivam' etc. Aparārka refers on Yāj. III. 254 to the reading 'sainām' 1028 adopted by some, says that the latter explain the verse as prescribing the penance for three years and observes that the verse of Manu (IX. 92 ) does not apply, as the latter say, to him alone whose palate has merely come in concact with liquor ( without his having actually swallowed it). Visvarupa (III. 248) does not explain the verse as prescribing a three years' penance nor does he refer to the contact of wine with the palate. The Mit., however, contains both these

particulars. On p. 1084 also:030 Aparārka seems to be referring to the view of the Mit. 
If one compares the portion of the Mit. on the section on rájadharma (Yaj. I. 309-368 ) with the commentary of Aparărka on the same section (verses 307–366 ) and bears in mind the fact that a reigning king is credited with composing the latter, one would be struck by the poverty of explanations in Aparārka's work as compared with the Mitàkşară. 
The date of Aparårka can be settled within very narrow limits. The Smrticandrikāl031 in several places quotes the views of Aparārka and sometimes contrasts them with those of the Mit. The Smrticandrikā refutes the view of Aparàrka that the words of Yăj. `jyeștham vă sresthabhāgena' are meant to comprehend all various modes of giving an additional share (uddhāravibhāga) to the eldest son on partition mentioned by Manu and others and it follows Aparārka's explanation of apratisthitā' in Gautama's text. It will be shown later on that the Smsticandrikā must have been composed about 1200 A. D. If the above conclusion that Apararka knew the Mit, and criticizes it be correct, Aparàrka must have flourished after 1100 A. D. and before 1200 A. D. Here epigraphical research comes to our help. We know from the commentary that the author Aparāditya was a silahāra prince of Jimātavāhana's family. Incriptions of the Silābāras show that there were three branches of that family, one ruling in the northern Konkan at Thana, the second in the southern Konkan and the third at Kolhapur.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Inscriptions of the northern Silāhāras speak of two kings who are named Aparādityadeva. In JBBRAS vol. XXI, pp. 505-516 there is a grant dated sake 1049 (expired) of Aparādityadeva who donated a village named Vadavali in the Thana District to a brāhmaṇa studying the Mädhyandina recension of the Vājasaneya sambità. The king is there styled once as Aparăjita and several times as Aparādityadeva. He was son of Anantadeva and grand-son of Nagarjuna and traced his descent to Jimūtavahana, son of Jimūtaketu, far famed in legend and literature as an exemplar of self-sacrifice, 1032 e. g. in the drama Nāgānanda. In this inscription Aparādityadeva is styled Silāhāranarendra and Jimütavā hananvayaprasūta as in the colophon of the commentary on Yāj. (vide note 1020 above) and also Mahamandaleśvara and Tagarapura parameśvara. In the Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute, vol. V, part 2, p. 169 there is a grant made at Somnath-Patan in Kathiawar of Vikramsamvat 1176 (1119-20 A. D.) while Aparādityadeva of the Silāhāra family was reigning, almost in the same words as in the grant in JBBRAS vol. XXI p. 505. Therefore it appears that the dates of Aparādityadeva I referred to in these grants fall between 1115 and 1130 A. D. It was most probably this king who composed the commentary on Yaj. We known from the Srikanthacarita of Markha that king Aparàditya1033 of Konkan sent Tejakantha on an embassy to an assembly of learned men in Kashmir during the reign of Jayasimha of Kashmir (1129 to 1150 A.D.). Aparārka's commentary continues to be the standard law-book used by the pandits of Kashmir (Jolly's Tagore Law Lectures p. 24). Aparàrka's work betrays familiarity with Kashmir. I have already noticed the reference to Rājānaka Sitikantha above. On a passage from Brahmapurāņa speaking of a śrāddha at Mártanda pådamūla, Aparārka notes (p. 903) that1034 the latter is well known in Kashmir. It is, therefore, most probable that the work

was composed about 1125 and was introduced into Kashmir when an embassy was sent from the Konkan king to Kashmir in the reign of Jayasimba. The dates of the second Aparāditya range from 1184 to 1187 A. D. (Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. XIII, part 2, p. 427; JBBRAS vol. XII. pp. 333-335 for an inscription of Aparaditya dated 1109 sake i. e. 1187 A. D. ( wherein he is styled Konkaņa-cakravarti). It is difficult to hold that this was the author of the commentary on Yāj. The Smsticandrika is men tioned by Hemadri and hence could not be later than the first quarter of the thirteenth century. Therefore if Aparārka who is frequently cited by the Smộticandrika were to be regarded as hav ing flourished about 1187 A. D., very little distance is left between Aparārka's commentary and the Smsticandrikā in order that the former should come to be looked upon as an authority by the latter. Therefore it appears probable that Aparărka wrote the commentary on Yaj in the first half of the 12th century (about 1125 A. D.). 
The commentary of Aparårka is in mere extent nearly double of the Mitàksarà. It quotes very long extracts, particularly from Purāņas, on several verses of Yāj. such as on I. 208 (on Godāna, gift of a cow) where he quotes lengthy extracts from Vişnudbarmottara-purāņa, Bhavisyottara-purāna on differ ent danas (called Dhenus ), then he quotes on 16 kinds of Dānas (called Mahadanas ) from whole chapters of Matsya, of Bhavisyottara, from Vişnudharmasútra (almost the whole of chap. 90) and from some other Purăņas. On Yāj. I. 226–228 he has an exposition on pp. 463-477; On Yāj. I. 252-253 ( on Sapiņdikarapa-sråddha ) he expends 14 pages (pp. 528–542 ). On the Prāyaścitta section also his expositions in certain cases are very long e. g. on III. 267-268 he devotes pp. 1106-1127, on III. 289-290 he devotes pp. 1152-1184. His quotations from Devala and Hårita ( both in verse and prose) are very extensive. If some scholar undertook the work of collecting together even all the prose passages of Devala, Sarkhalikhita and Härita drawn from the several commentaries and nibandhas it would be a large and valuable work. For example, if one collects only the prose passages of Devala cited in Aparārka they will cover about five closely printed pages of the same work. Similarly, Hārita is profusely quoted in prose and verse by Aparårka e. g. pages 937, 1113, 1116, 1152 have long prose passages.

81. Pradipa 
The Smộtyarthasāra of Sridhara enumerates the Pradipa among its authorities after the Kamadhenu.1035 The Smstican drikà in a highly paronomastic verse appears to refer to a work called Pradipa.1036 The Sarasvativilāsa 037 quotes the view of the Pradipa that even the suretyship debt of a person must be paid by his grandson. The Jivatpitska nirnaya1038 of Ramakrsna (about 1600 A. D.) quotes the Pradipa on the question that when brothers are separated they should perform separately the annual sraddha of their father and other ancestors. Nandapandita in bis commentary on the1038 Şadasiti cites the view of the Pradipa that the sutra of Paithinasi ( a woman delivered of a son bathing after twenty nights from 
delivery is entitled to perform all religious rites, while one who is delivered of a female child is so entitled after a month ) applies to the wife of one who is not a dikșita (one who has consecrated the Vedic fires ). It has been shown above (note 881 ) how the Pradipa criticizes Bhavadeva, according to the Viramitrodaya, which, in several places, cites the views of the Pradipa ( vide pp. 78, 89, 215 etc.). 
The foregoing discussion shows that the Pradipa was probably an independent work on vyavahāra, śràddha, suddhi and other topics. Being mentioned by the Smrtyarthasāra and Smsticandri kā, it cannot be later than about 1150 A. D. As it criticizes Bhavadeva it cannot be earlier than 1100 A. D.

The Smrtyarthasāra of Sridhara 
725 
Hemādri1010 refers to the explanation of the word kala occurring in a text of Gárgya offered by a Smộtipradipa. It is not unlikely that he means the same work as is referred to by others as Pradipa. 
82. 
The Smộtyarthasāra of Sridhara 
This well-known work was published by the Anandăśrama Press, Poona, in 1912 A. D. The principal topics discussed by it are : the acts allowed in former ages but forbidden in the kali age; the number of samskāras, the detailed treatment of Upanayana, the duties of Brahmacárin, holidays, marriage, its various forms, prohibitions on the ground of sapinda relation, discussion about gotra and pravara, daily duties such as sauca, acamana brushing the teeth, bathing, the five yajñas, daily saṁdhyā, daily worship; detailed treatment of śrāddha, proper time, articles, and brā hmanas to be invited at it, various kinds of śrāddha, discussion about various tithis; intercalary month; forbidden and allowed food; purification of various substances and of one's own body; impurity on birth and death; rites after death; rules about sam nyasa; prayaścittas for various grades of sins and lapses. 
From the colophon it appears that Sridhara was himself a performer of Vedic sacrifices and was the son of Nagabhart? Vişnubhatta of the Viśvāmitra gotra. This colophon does not however occur in the ancient ms. of the work in the Deccan College collection (No. 44 of 1870-71 ) dated samvat 1495 (1438-39 A. D.). In the 2nd introductory verse (vide H. of Dh. vol. I. pt.1 note 749 ) the author tells us that Srikantha and Srikarācārya filled the gaps in the smrtis that were scattered about (i. e. they composed digests thereof with their own remarks ). He also says (vide note 839 above) that he relies on the Kamadhenu, the Pradipa, the Abdhi, the Kalpavşksa (i. e. Kalpataru ), Kalpalată, Sambhu, Dravida, Kedåra and Lollata and the various commentators of Manu and other smrtikaras. In dealing with saṁnyása he says that he would treat of the proce

dure of samnyasa following the opinion of Govindaraja and of Baudhayana.1041 At the beginning of some sections (p. 48 and p. 49 on sraddha and prayascitta respectively) he again repeats the verse about Kāmadhenu and the other authorities. The Abdhi named therein seems to be the Smstimahārņava quoted in Hemādri, in the Vivādaratnākara and other works. He refers to Mitāksarā also (p. 56). For Lollata see above ( under Medha tithi ). It appears that Sridhara also composed another and a larger work on dharmaśāstra. For example, Hemādri who 1042 knew the Smstyarthasăra quotes certain views as Sridhara's which do not occur in the Smrtyarthasāra. The Prayogapārijāta, the Nirnayasindhu, and the Samskārakaustubha quote the views of a work called Sridhariya which are not found in the Smrtyarthasara. Sridhara seems to have been a writer from southern Ind 
The date of the Smộtyarthasara can be fixed within approxi mate limits. As it names the Mit., the Kamadhenu, the Kalpa taru and Govindaraja, it is later than 1150 A. D. The Smrti candrikā and Hemådri1043 both quote it as an authority. For example, the Smộticandrikā says that the Smộtyarthasära holds that the Tulasi is among the things the use of which is to be avoided in śrāddha. Vide p. 435 of the Sraddha section of the

Smstcandrika (Gharpure's edition ) and also pp. 366, 381, 463 of the Sraddha section of the same work. Raghunandana often men tions it; vide (vol. I) Tithi p. 100, Srāddha p. 190, Āhnika p. 434, Malamāsa p. 791; (II) Yajurvedi Vrsotsarga p. 642. The Madanapārijāta mentions it frequently - vide pp. 177, 180, 287, 288. Therefore the Smộtyarthasāra must have been composed between 1150 and 1200 A. D. 
83. Aniruddha 
Aniruddhabhattha is one of the early and eminent Bengal writers on Dharmaśāstra. His Häralată was published in the Bibliotheca Indica Series (1909) and his Pitļdayità alias Karmo. padesinipaddhati was recently published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parishad at Calcutta (No. 6). 
The Häralată deals with impurity on birth and death, with the acts allowed to be done or forbidden during impurity, with periods of impurity on death in a distant land or on the deaths of infants and women, with rules when two periods of impurity overlap each other, with impurity on the death of sapindas, the meaning of sapinda, persons who have not to observe periods of impurity, cremation and burial, offering of water to the deceased, observances during mourning, persons entitled to perform rites after death, observances after the period of mourning, persons to whom no water should be offered. 
The Pitrdayità is a work intended for the followers of the Samaveda. Its contents are :- the duties on rising from bed, brushing the teeth, bath, samdhyā, tarpana, vaisvadeva pārvana śrāddha, eulogy of gifts, sapiņdikaraṇa and other srāddhas, antyesti and rites during the days of mourning after death, the letting loose of a bull. The printed work appears to be the same that is described in the I. O. Cat. at p. 474 as Karmopadesini. But the India Oflice Ms. appears to have certain various read ings e. g. a reference to Kamadhenu and Kalpataru at the end of the section on antyești does not occur in the printed text. 1044

History of Dharmaśāstra 
. 
The first verse of the Hāralată states that the author con sulted the commentaries on Manu and other Smrtis.1045 Besides the well-known smrtikāras such as Manu, Yajnavalkya, Narada etc. the authors and works named in the Haralata are:-- Asahaya as the Bhāsyakāra of Gautama, Kamadhenu, Govindaraja, Bho jadeva, Visvarupa and Saikhadhara. The Pitrdayital046 says that it was composed after consulting the Gobhilagshyasūtra, the Chāndogyapariţişta, smộtis, the sõstras of Gautama and Vasistha and various samgraha works. In the work itself, besides the above, Katyayana, Varahapurana and smaller ( svalpa) Matsya purāņa are quoted. 
From the last verse2047 of the Hāralatā we know that Aniruddha was a resident of Viharapātaka on the bank of the Ganges and was a student of the doctrines of Bhatta (Kumärila ). From the colophons1048 at the end of the Hāralatā and the Pitrdayità it appears that he was a Dharmadhyaksa and a Campihattiya ( a section among Varendras) Brahmana of Bengal. The ms. in the India Office has a colophon in which Aniruddha is styled Dharmadhikaraṇika (Judge). From the Danasāgara of Ballalasena we learn (verses 6 and 7) that Aniruddha was a guruof the king of Bengal and rendered assistance in the composition of that work. The Dānasāgara1049 was composed in sake 1091 (i. e. 1169 A. D.). From this it appears that Aniruddha was at the height of his fame in 1168, i. e. his literary activity may be placed in the third quarter of the 12th century A. D. This

conclusion is corroborated by the fact that Häralată names Bhojadeva, Govindarāja, and the Kāmadbenu as authorities and is therefore later than 1100 A. D. The Hāralatà is pamed as an authority in the Suddhiviveka of Rudradhara. 1050 The Sraddha kriyakaumudi of Govindananda (about 1510-1545 A. D.) frequently quotes Aniruddha and includes him among ancient authors.1051 In the Buddhitattva of Raghunandana, Aniruddha is referred to in the plural as a mark of respect and his view is explained. In several other places the Hāralata10516 is quoted and rarely criticized in the Smộtitattva :- vide (vol. I) Śrāddha p. 321 (cri.); (Vol. II.) Udvaha p. 108, Suddhi pp. 238, 250 (cri.), 259, 262, 275, 291, 314. The Pitrdayità is frequently quoted by him, (vol. I). On Tithi (p. 13 cri. ), p. 176; Śràddba pp. 200, 202, 231; Ahnika p. 358 (stating that the Pitrdayità quoted Yogiyājñavalkya VII. 162–165, VI. 27-28 ), 289, 393, p. 421 (cri), 424; and (vol. II. Suddhi p. 314, Yajurvedi-sraddha p. 497 ). Aniruddhabhatta is frequently men. tioned without naming any one of his works in (vol. I) Sraddha tattva pp. 209 (crí. ), 220, 221, 222 ( cri. as 'heyam' ), 241 (cri. as 
pramàņaśūnya'), 227 (cri. ), Ahnika (p. 395), Malao p. 801; Ekādasi vol. II. p. 44. There is a commentary on the Hăralatā called Sandarbhasūcikà composed by Acyuta Cakravartin, son of Haridasa Tarkācārya (vide I, O. Cat. p. 567, No. 1753 ). In JASB (New Sries) vol. XI. p. 362 the com. of Acyuta is described as Sandarbhasūtikā which seems to be a misprint for 
sūcika'.

Raghunandana in his Ekadasitattva1052 (vol. II. p. 44) makes a casual but very striking remark. The question is about what

day as Ekādasi should be observed when the latter is mixd up with Dasami (tithi ) or 12th. Vācaspati-Mišra relying on a verse in Vişnurahasya held that Ekādasi mixed up with tenth should be observed as fast by one who does so for securing some object, while Ekādaśī mixed with 12th should be observed as fast by one who is niskāma (who has no object in view ). Raghunandana replies that Vişnurahasya has been declared as apocryphal by the Danasāgara claimed to have been composed by Aniruddha Bhatta ( as stated in the Dànasāgrara itself). Raghunandana probably held and wants to suggest that the Danasāgara was really com posed by Aniruddha and allowed to be put forward in the name of his patron, king Ballklasena. This will be discussed under the heading 'Ballālasena and Laksmanasena'. 
In the proceedings of the ASB (for 1869 p. 317) a Catur masyapaddhati of Aniruddha is noted. Mitra notices a work called Bhagavattattvamñjari on Vaispava philosophy written by Aniruddha ( Mitra's Notices vol. III. p. 155, No. 2700 ). 
84. Ballālasena and Lakşmaņasena 
These two famous kings of Bengal ( father and son ) com piled five works on Dharmaśāstra viz. Acārasagara, Pratisthà sāgara, Vratasāgara, Dànasāgara, and Adbhutaságara. Of these, all except Adbhutasāgara, were compiled by Ballàlasena; the fifth, Adbhutasāgara, was begun by Ballălasena, but it was completed by Lakşmanasena. 
When the first edition of the H. of Dh. (first volume ) was published in 1930, the only published work of Ballālasena was 
• Adbhutasagara' about which we are told (vide under Halāyudha above) that it was begun by Ballālasena in sake 1090 (i. e. 1168-69 A. D.) but that he passed away before the work was finished and that it was completed by king Lakṣmaṇasena, son of Ballālasena. The Dànasāgara is a huge digest on Dàna ( gifts ).

It has been edited and published in the B. I. Series ( 1956 ) by Mr. (now Doctor) Bhabatosh Bhattacarya, with a Preface, contents in Sanskrit, Introduction in English (pp. XV-LXVIII ), Index of Vedic Mantras, and of non-Vedic quarter verses and prose quotations. The text alone covers 722 pages. There are 75 Āvartas1053 (chapters) and 1375 kinds of gifts have been dealt with. The Editor gives a summary of 18 chapters that are the most important of the 75 chapters (on pp. XL-LXVIII of Intro.). The Vratasågara is mentioned on pp. 52 and 59 of Dànasāgara and Dr. Bhattacarya pointed out in Indian Culture' vol. XI for 1945 pp. 141-144 that the Křtyaratnākara cites two quotations from the Vrataságara. Verses 55 and 56 of the printed Danasāgara' refer to the Pratisthāsāgara and Acārasågara as already composed. The first (verse 55 ) says that reservoirs of water and temples of gods are not dilated upon in Dànasāgara, because they have been well dealt with in Pratisthāsāgara and verse 56 says that certain dānas mentioned in the · Adipurana' are not fully dealt with in the Danasāgara as they have been mentioned in the Ācārasāgara. 
The Dānasāgara deals with the sixteen great dānas and other lesser gifts. The subjects dealt with by the Danasagara are as follows : eulogy of brāhmanas, eulogy of the merit arising from gifts, proper recipients of gifts, persons not fit to receive gifts, the nature of gifts, the donor, faith as to the utility of gifts, proper times and places for gifts, things proper to be donated, what cannot be gifted away, bad donations, religious rites and procedure followed in making gifts and in accepting them, the technical terms of the subject of gifts, the sixteen mahädanas, lesser danas of various kinds (the author himself says at the end that he has described 1375 kinds of gifts ), the names of various Purāṇas and their extent. The Dānasägara contains extremely valuable information about the Mahābhārata and the Puràņas. As it quotes extensively from the Puranas, it serves as an excellent check for the textual restoration of Purăņas. For example it says that the Bhagavata, Brahmānda and Náradiya Puràņas do not contain dānavidhis and hence they are not drawa 
1053 
The usual meaning of ' Avarta' is whirlpool or eddy' as the Amarakośa says 'syād-āvartosmbhasām bhramah'. The name of the work ending in 'sāgara' ( ocean) suggested that parts of the work may be called 'āvartas'.

upon in the work. In another verse he says that it is well-known that the Vişnurahasya and Sivarahasya are of the nature of mere compilations and so have not been relied on in the work. The Devipurāņa, he says, is approved of by the heterodox systems and is not included in various lists of Purapas and upapuràņas and hence it is not included in the Dänasāgara. He says that the subject of the dedication of reservoirs of water and of temples has been dealt with at length in the Pratisthà sågara, so it is omitted in the Danasāgara and that the gifts made in accordance with the divisions of the year (into ayana, season, month, pakșa &c.) are not spoken of in their entirety in the Dānasāgara, as they are described in the Ācārasågara. The work is mentioned in the Danaratnākara of Caņdesvara and in the Nirnayasindhu. His Adbhutasāgara has been printed by Messrs. Prabhakari and Co. ( 1905). The Authorities on which he relies therein are noted below.1054 The adbhutasagara is men tioned in Todarānandasamhita-saukhya and Nirnayasindhu. This was his last work which he left unfinished and which was comple ted by his son Lakşınanasena. It deals with the rites and observances appropriate on certain celestial and terrestrial por tents for removing the evil foreboded by them. 
The word 'adbhuta' occurs many times in the Rgveda and the Nirukta I. 6 tries to explain it. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 719-738 for the development of the subject of sāntis against un favourable occurrences and portents and pp. 740-746 for the meanings and disquisition on the three cognate words “adbhuta, utpåta and nimitta.' Raghunandana quotes and illustrates a passage of the Adbhutasāgara ( quoted below).1055 The idea was that an unusual happening like an earth-quake occurs as a divine indication or warning of an impending calamity. Such a view was entertained even by Western people and poets till the end of the 18th century. The Cowper in his Task gives powerful support

to such an idea. The Adbhutasagara is mentioned by Raghu nandana in vol. I of Jyotistattva, p. 704 and Malamāsa, p. 765. 
In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to prove to the satisfaction of scholars when the La. Sam. was started. If it was started on Laksmanasena's birth, it could have been done only by Ballălasena or by Lakşmanasena himself when he became a king. But both of them though concerned with the Adbhutas, gara, several times refer only to the Saka era as the notes show. If it was started by Laksmanasena he also does not mention any era as having been started by him and counted from his birth, He was concerned with the compilation of at least a portion of the Adbhutaságara. In the E. I, Vol. 14. p. 156 ( the Naihati grant ) the pedigree starts from Samantasena ( said to be a scion of the Candravamsa) and that grant also names the following rulers viz. Hemantasena, Vijayasena, Ballalasena, Lakşmaņasena. The latter lost Bengal and ruled for some years in North Bihar. In the confusion about the starting point of the La. Saṁ, it appears to the present author that the only safe course is to hold that the era probably started about the time when he left Bengal or some years after it. 
Another vexed question is whether the Dănasăgara was com posed by Ballalasena or really composed by Aniruddhabhatta, but was allowed to be passed off as composed by his patron. The answer depends upon a proper construction of verses 6-9 of the Introduction to the Dānasāgara. Verse 6 bestows high praise on Aniruddha, who was the guru of Ballala, who was like BỊhaspati, the guru of Indra, who was highly honoured in the land of Varendri (North Bengal ), whose eye in the form of his ever active brilliant and flashing intellect was fixed on brahman in the form of Sarasvati (Goddess of Learning). Verses 7-8 cenvey that he (Ballăla) having learnt with great faith from that guru the essence of all Purāṇas and Smộtis was desirous of composing a work on Dāna ( gifts ), yet his ardour, being cooled by doubts about the difficult decisions in the matter of Dharma, he began to wait upon brāhmaṇas, who were pleased by his service, and with his incessant association with them his mind became clear and his doubts vanished. King Ballàla benefitting by faith in the instruction imparted by his guru composed, for the good of the

History of Dharmaśāstra 
faithful, this owork called Danasāgara within the limits of his intellect.1056 
Ballalasena began the work in 1090 sāke and the Dänasagara was composed in 1091 sake. Therefore Ballālasena's literary activity must be placed in the third quarter of the 12th century (vide notes 861, 862 above). Vide also IHQ vol. V, p. 133 for the date of Ballālasena. 
It appears that Raghunandana believed that the Dānasagara was really the work of Aniruddhabhatta though published in the name of Ballālasena. In the Dānasāgara itself it is distinctly stated that Ballàlasena composed it under the directions of his guru 
1056 
The verses 6-9 would occupy much space; so only half of the last verse ( 9 ) is quoted here : stage at T T TTI: FTET I Faxafa ETHITTAİ araat È II He suggests that the ( sāgara ) ocean is vast, while his prajñū (intellect) is limited and even this limited work he compiled with the help of the instruction imparted by his guru and he had also the benefit of constapt meetinys with learned brābmanas, The present author feels that this is a very straightforward statement of the facts. He says that be owes everything to the vast learning of his guru, but his intellect is limited (and not vast ) and therefore the work he composed is necessarily limited to what his intellect understood from the ocean-like intellect of his guru. If Raghunandana beads that Danasāgara was wholly written by Aniruddha and Ballālasena was only a dummy or a figurehead, the present author thinks that he is wrong. He may have been swayed by some tradition floating in his day about the authorship. On the facts available the work is Ballalasena's, though the latter derived his knowledge from the teachings of his guru and from the learned brāhmaṇas of his time whom he gather ed together for the purpose of writing the work, 
The Dānasāgara is a model of a systematic work. He mentions the works he consulted (mainly Purāņas, Up& purānas, Smộtis, the two epics and Gopatha-Brābnapa) and sets out the works he did not draw upon and the reasons therefor. He briefly enumerates 1375 danas and the 15 main sections of the work, 
He names 13 Purāņas, 8 Upapurāṇas and 28 Smộtis and three specified works viz. the two epics and the Gopatha

(Aniruddha ).1057 In the colophon he is styled mahārājādhiraja and niḥsanka-sankara. 
85. Harihara 
From quotations in the Vivādaratnākara it appears that Hari hara wrote on vyavahāra. For example, the Vivādaratnākara first quotes (on p. 220) the definition of samsarapa' given by BỊhaspati and then cites three verses of Kātyāyana defining a catusaptha and a rājamārga and prescribing punishments for causing obstruction and committing nuisance thereon. Then it notices that the verse 
yas-tatra' cited by it from Kātyāyana is cited by Harihara as from Prajāpati when the topic immediately preceding is 
saṁsarana '.1058 The Vivàdaratnākara quotes a sūtra of Sarkha Likhita prescribing the punishment for sexual intercourse with a virgin against her will and Harihara's explanation of the word 
(Continued from the previous page) Brāhmaṇa, in all 52 works. At the and of the work (on p. 72), he names 46 works the opinions of which he considered and composed the Dāpasāgasa. The learned editor points this discrepancy in the Intro. (p. xxii ). 
The learned editor has spared no pains to make up the edition useful to scholars. I entirely agree with what he says about the late Professor Rangaswami Aiyangar's entirely redi culous remark about the Dänasāgara containing a reference to Kalpataru ( the work of Lakşınidhara) in verse 3 of the introductory verses and his remarks about what the great historian Dr. R. C. Majumdar's reading 'sārasvata-brāhma ņāḥ' in verse 6 of the Introductory verses of the Dāna sāgara (English Intro. p. xx foot-note 2). He has identi fied most of the quotations, but some have eluded him. For example on p. 17 the text quotes Vasiştha's verse 'ye kşānta dāntāḥ ...', but the editor does not note that it is Vasistha Dharmasūtra VI, 25.

History of Dharmaśástra 
dvyangulaccheda ’1059 From these it is clear that Harihara wrote some work on vyavahara, which has not yet been recovered. He must have flourished earlier than 1300 A. D. 
There is a commentary on the Paraskaragļhyasútra composed by Harihara who is styled agnihotrin in the colophons. In one ms. copied in sake 1707 (1785-86 A. D.) he is described as the pupil of Vijñānesvara. In the introductory second verse he says he relies on Vasudera. In the body of the work he refers (Gujarati Press edition) to Karkopādhyāya (p. 200 ), Kalpatarukāra, Repudikșita, and Vijñanesvarācārya (p. 370). Therefore he is later than 1150 A. D. Harihara's views are mentioned by Hemādri,1060 the Samaya pradipa1061 and Acārādarśa of Sridatta and in the Smộtisára of Harinātha. Therefore this Harihara must be earlier than 1250 A. D. Whether he was really the pupil of Vijñānešvara is doubtful. In his bhāsya Harihara refers to words current in Kanoj. 1082 Hemădri mentions Harihara's explanation of nepalakambala wherein the latter says that it is well known among the northerners. 1063 Hariharapaddhati is frequently mentioned in the Smộtitattva of Raghunandana ; vide (vol. I.) Srāddha p. 261, Ahnika p. 424, Malamāsa p. 745 ( a verse is quoted); (vol. II. ) Divya p. 593, Udvaha p. 132, Vrata p. 158 (name Harihara only). We have seen above that Harihara commented upon the Aśaucadaśaka of Vijñàneśvara. This fact together with his being not far from Vijñānesvara's time may have led to the belief that he was a pupil of Vijñanesvara. It appears probable that the jurist Harihara who flourished before 1300 and Harihara the bhāsyakāra of Paraskara

who flourished between 1150 and 1250 A. D. are identical. The views ascribed to Harihara by Hemādri in his section on śrāddha are not found in the bhäşya on Pāraskara. Therefore Hemàdri is referring to some other work of Harihara. From a passage of Hemādri it appears that Harihara wrote after the Mahārnava1064 ( Prakāśa ). Hemadri also tells us that Haribara refuted the views of Jayantasvāmi on a certain verse. 1065 The same Harihara who commented on Paraskara also wrote a commentary on Kätyāyana's Snānavidhisútra wherein he mentions the Kalpatarukära (vide D. C. ms, No. 101 of 1891-95). Several Hariharas are known. There is Hariharabhattācārya, the father of the great Bengal writer Raghunandana. A Hariharăcārya composed an astrological work Samayapradipa in šake 1481 ( 1559–1560 A, D.). 
86. The Smộticandrikā of Devannabhatta This is a well-known digest on Dharmaśāstra. An English translation of the portion of it which is concerned with dāyabhāga was published in 1867 by T. Krisnasvami Iyer at Madras. The text has been published by Mr. J. R. Gharpure ( up to śrāddha) in Bombay and also in the Mysore Government Oriental Series ( up to àśauca ). In the following Mr. Gharpure's edition has been used and the Mysore edition for āśauca section. 
The Smsticandrikā published by Mr. Gharpure is a huge work of large size covering about 736 pages on the topics of some samskäras (88 pages ), Ahnika ( 144 pages ), Vyavahāra ( 332 pages ), and Sraddha ( 172 pages ). According to the colo phons at the end of the sections, it appears that the author was called Devapna-bhattopadhyāya, son of Keśavāditya-bhattopā dhyāya. The fifth introductory verse asserts that all that he writes is based on authoritative texts and that he has stated noth ing purely relying on his own ideas (or imagination ).1068

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Smsticandrika is a very extensive digest. It is almost the earliest (except the Kalpataru ) among digests on dharmaśāstra of which mss. have yet been discovered. The printed text deals with the topics (kāndas ) of Samskara, Ahnika, Vyavahāra, Srāddha, Asauca. It appears that he worte on prāyaścitta also. In the colophons of mss. of the work the name of the author is variously written as Devansa, Devana, Devananda or Devagaña (vide 1. O. Cat. pp. 405-406 ). He is also described therein as the son of Keśavadityabhatta and as a Somayāji. 
The Smsticandrikā quotes most profusely from numerous smrtikāras and affords valuable assistance in reconstructing some of the smstis and checking mss. and editions thereof. For example, it quotes about 600 verses from Kātyāyana on vyavahāra and about the same number from BỊhaspati. From Manu and Nārada more verses are quoted than even from Kātyāyana and Bșhaspati. Among works, commentators and authors of digests named by it the following may be noted : Aparārka, Karmapradipa which is the same as Gobhilasmīti ( II. 126-127) with slight variations (Anand. ed.), Devarāta, Devasvāmi, Apastambakalpabhāsyår thakāra (Asauca p. 84), Dhäreśvara, Dharmabhàşya, Dhūrtasvāmi, Pradipa, Bhavanātha, Bhăşya on Apastamba Dharmasútra, Dharmadipa or Pradipa ( Asauca p. 63), Bhäsyārthasamgraha kāra, Manuvịtti, Medhătithi, Mitākşarà, Rāmāyana (four verses), and Varahamihira (one verse), Vaijayanti ( a lexicon ), Višvarūpa, Viśvadarsa ( Asauca p. 164 ), Sambhu, Srikara, Sivasvāmi, Smsti bhāskara, Smộtyarthasara. He mentions a Bhattācārya on Asauca (p. 1,2), probably Šrinivāsa, the author of Suddhidipikā who worte about 1159-60 A. D. (JASB 1915 p. 334 ). He quotes a passage from the work of an author, whom he styles Guru (proba bly his own teacher or father ). 1067 The Smsticandrikå often criti cizes these works and authors and advances its own views after considering the positions of others. Devarnabhatta was a south ern writer and his work is according to judicial decisions of great authority in southern India,1068 But it has been held that in

spite of its high authority it cannot override the Mitàkşarà even in the Madras Presidency.1069 
The Smộticandrikà quotes from 23 Purāṇas and Upapurāņas i. e. from more Puràņas than even Apasārka. They are set out in the note below.1070 
For the Asauca-kānda of the Sms. C. I had to use the Mysore University's edition of 1921 (203 pages ). It starts with the verse of Sarkha that the following religious acts are stopped while the āśauca (impurity on account of death ) exists, viz. religious gifts and their acceptance, homa (worship of Fire ), study of the Veda and rites for one's deceased ancestor (except the offering of pindas to the recently dead person for whose sake asauca is observed ). It quotes immediate performance of purificatory rite for one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fortnight, a month and until death. It deals with impu rity on birth also and concludes with the putting into the Ganges or some holy place the ashes of the dead and with Sraddha at Gaya. 
The contents of the Smsticandrikā are : various Dharmas, such as those of varnas, àśramas; usages of countries; samskāras, garbha-dbāna, puṁsavana, jätakarma, nămakarana, cùdākarana, upanayana, marriage, etc., duties of student-hood and holidays; daily duties such as sauca, ācamana, brushing the teeth, bath ing, samdhya, śrauta and smārta rites; duties of householder ; the five daily yajñas; rules about taking food, forbidden food; proce dure of law-courts, means of proof, ordeals, the various titles of law such as deposit, partnership, dâyabhāga; detailed rules about sraddha, its various kinds, persons entitled to perform sraddhas, the brahmanas proper to be invited at śråddha etc.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Smsticandrikā refers to Vijñāneśvara with great respect.1071 Yet there are several interesting points on which the Smsticandrika differs from the Mitākṣarā. The Smsticandrika questions ( vide note 825 above) the statement of the Mit. that unequal distribu tion by the father of ancestral property among his sons should not be resorted to, as it has come to be abhorred by the people. The Smsticandrikā does not approve of the definition of daya given by the Mit.1072 The Smxticandrika does not accept Vijnanesvara's explanation of the word 'apratisthită' occurring in the sūtra of Gautama, but upholds Apararka's explanation of it (vide note 1031 above). The Smrticandrika favours the theory of spiritual benefit in matters of succession and therefore among daughters prefers one that has sons over another daughter who is sonless.1078 It criticizes the reasons advanced by the Mit. for preferring the mother over the father as an heir to their deceased son and says that both parents succeed together.1074 Though the Smsticandrika in this way in some cases criticizes the Mit., it generally follows its lead. It holds, just as the Mit. does, that sons acquire by birth ownership in ancestral property. The author asserts that he puts forward no imaginary views but only such views as are based on (authoritative) texts.1075 
As the Smsticandrikā names the Mit., Aparärka and Smrtyar. thasara, its upper limit cannot be placed earlier than 1150 A. D.

The Smsticandrikā of Devannabhatļa 
741 
Their Lordships of the Privy Council say in Buddhasingh vs Laltu singh1076 that Devanandabhatta is supposed to have been a contemporary of Aparārka. But this supposition is not quite correct. Since Aparārka is quoted several times as an authority to be preferred even to the Mit., it looks more probable that there is some distance of time between Aparärka and Devanna bhatta. Hemādri quotes the views of the Smộticandrikā probably oftener than those of any other nibandhakāra. In one place1077 he does not approve of the explanation given by the Smsticandrika of a verse occurring in the Mahabharata about a man with male issue performing sraddha on the thirteenth tithi. In an other!078 place Hemādri refers to the view of the Smrticandrikä on the question whether the śrāddha on amāvāsyā is optional with śraddha in dark half. Therefore it follows that the Smsticandrikā must have been composed at least a generation earlier than Hemādri i. e. before 1225 A. D. The Smsticandrika is frequently quoted by the Sarasvativilāsa, the Viramitrodaya and other digests. 
Several authors composed works styled Smrticandrika, e. g. there is a Smrticandrikā of Sukadeva-miśra ( I. O. Cat. p. 471 No. 1549), another by Ápadeva (Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 301 ), another by Vamadevabhattācārya (Mitra's Notices, vol. IX. p. 137 ).

. 
87. Haradatta 
Haradatta's fame stands very high as a commentator. He wrote a commentary called Anakulä on the Apastamba-gļhya-sútra (D.C. Ms. No. 2 of 1866-68), a commentary on the Apastambiya mantra-pătha ( vide Dr. Winternitz's ed. of 1897, p. XIII.), a com mentary called Anàvila on the Asvalāyana-gļhya-sútra ( published in the Trivandrum Series ), a commentary called Mitāksarà on the Gautamadharmasútra and a commentary named Ujjvalà on the dharmasūtra of Āpastamba. His commentaries are very good models of ideal commentaries. His commentary on the dharma sutra of Gautama (printed by the Anandasrama Press, Poona ) is more concise than that on the Dharmasútra of Apastamba ( large extracts of which were published by Bühler in his edition in the B. S. Series, the whole being printed by Halasyanath Sastri at Kumbhakonam and in the Mysore Government Oriental Library Series ). In bis commentary on the Dharmasútras he quotes verses from numerous smstis and from the purăņas but hardly ever mentions by name any commentator or nibandhakāra. In his Anavilā (page 9 ) he quotes the views of a Bhāsyakára who is probably Devasvamin and mentions also a Candogagļhyabhāsya kära (on 1. 2. 3). In his commentaries on both the Dharmasútras he frequently quotes the opinions of previous commentators with the words 'anye,' aparah,' kecit;' vide G. Dh. S. II. 28, VII. 4 and 14, IX. 52, XI. 17, XII, 32 and 33, XXIV. 5, XXVI. 9, XXVIII, 7 and 44; Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 24, I. 2.5.2 and 18, I. 3. 10.4, 1. 3. 11. 20, 1. 5. 15. 20 etc. From the fact that he mentions two interpretations on Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 2. with the words 
apara àha' and 'ityanye' and several interpretations on II. 7. 17. 22 it follows that he had before him two or three commenta ries on Āp. Dh. S. In Bühler's edition Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 38 appears to refer to a gļhya-vștti, but in the Kumbha konam edition the reading is different (viz. grhye gatam ). He is very careful to point out the un-Paninean forms in the sūtras of Gautamał079 and Åpastamba, explains at great length all grammatical matters and generally prefers readings that are in consonance with the rules of Pāṇini. He very often says that the 
1079 e. g. on H. 9. . XXV. 8 he says "qiqatla qari a tadi

87. Haradatta 
743 
text of the sitras, particularly of Āpastamba, as handed down by oral tradition was either wrong or followed Vedic usage as regards grammar.1030 
From various references Haradatta seems to have been an inhabitant of Southern India or was at least very familiar with its usages. On Gautama XI. 20 he instances several usages of the Colas. On Gautama XV. 18 he gives a synonym in the Dravida language for1081 a skin disease called - Kilása.' On Āp. Gr. S. VI. 6 ( the sútra 'nadinirdesasca' etc.) he gives Kaveri and Vegavati as instances. On Āp. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 15 ( last sutra) he refers to certain practices of the Dravidas observed when the Sun is in Aries or Virgo.1092 The Viramitrodaya classes Haradatta and the Smrticandrikākåra among southern nibandhakaras. 1088 From his remark on Āp. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 25 ( the sütra ' anyatra rähudarsanāt') that the northerners do not recite that sūtra it appears that he affirms that he was a southerner. 
Haradatta seems to have been a great devotee of Siva. He begins his commentary on Gautama, on Aśvalāyana-gļhya and Áp. Gị. with an obeisance to Rudra and his commentaries on Áp. Dh. S. and on the Apastambiya-mantra-pătha (otherwise called Ekāgnikānda, 25th and 26th praśnas of Āpastamba-kalpa) with an obeisance to Mahadeva. Burnell ( Tanjore mss. cat. p. 170 ) tells us that according to tradition in Southern India, Rudradatta, the commentator of the Ap. Srauta-sútra, is the same as Haradatta. In his commentary on Ăp. Gț. S. 1. 13. 5 ( ghosavad caturaksaram và) he gives as instances of the names of males Hara, Rudra, Deva, Haradatta and Bhayanaga. In the colophons the Anávila is described as the work of Haradattācārya-misra.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Haradatta (on Ap. Dh. S. I. 8. 22. 1-2 ) has a disquisition on the correct knowledge and realization of the self (Atman). He quotes Mundakopanisad II. 9 (bhidyate &c.), Chan. Up. VI. 24. 3 and Yaj. Smrti I. 8 (ayam tu paramo dharmo yad yogenatma darśanam), puts the Advaitavedānta view in a nutshell, narrates the story of a prince brought up since boyhood among Sabara (bhil ) children regarding himself as a sabara, but the truth dawns upon him when his mother tells him who he really was; and quotes four Sardūlavikridita verses on the same story and the 
moral.1084 
Ghose in his Hindu Law ( 3rd ed. Intro. p. xv) says that, like Medhătithi, Haradatta denies the heritable rights of widows and must have come before Vijñāześvara and not after. But Ghose appears to be wrong. Haradatta first says that according to the acarya (i. e. Apastamba) the sapindas of the deceased who took the property were obliged to maintain the widow of the deceased, while the view of Gautama was that the widow took, on failure of male issue, an equal share along with the sapindas, and then Haradatta says that he himself liked the latter view,1085 He often gives interesting information. On Gautama XVII. 33 he tells us that asafoetida is eaten by all, even though it is a matter for consideration whether being the exudation of a tree, it is to be regarded as due to cutting ( and so forbidden ).1086 On Ap. Dh. S. II. 2.5. 14 he cites as an example of reviling (a-krosa) the

following: the Taittiriya is a Sákhà that is ucсhizta (the leavings of food eaten ), the Yājñavalkya and other Brāhmaṇa works are modern '.1087 On Gautama IV. 5 he says that what distinguishes the Prājāpatya form of marriage from the Brāhma and others is that there is in the former a stipulation that the husband is not to enter into another order of life (aśrama ) nor is he to marry another woman.1088 On Ap. Dh. S. 1.4. 12.15 he says that whereas in the case of marriage with a paternal aunt's or maternal uncle's daughter, the act springs from the fact that one is pleased thereby, there is no necessity to infer a śāstra (a Vedic passage ) once existing but now lost (in support of such usage ).1089 
The date of Haradatta is a rather difficult problem. Bühler (S. B. E. vol. II. P. XLIII) at first thought that Haradatta probably wrote in the 16th century, but in his 2nd edition of the Āp. Dh. S. he says (P. VIII) that the Munich ms. of the Ujjvală written in Poona about 1600 A. D. shows the interpolated text found in all Devanāgari copies and that therefore Haradatta is older than at least 1450-1500 A. D. The Viramitrodaya1090 frequently cites the Mitākṣarā of Haradatta on Gautama. Nārāyanabhatta ( born in 1513 A. D.) in his Prayoga-ratna quotes Haradatta's comment on Gautama VIII. 14-22 about samskäras and his son Sankarabhatta names both the Mitākşarà and the Ujjvala of Haradatta in his Dvaitanirnaya. The Prayogapärijäta of NȚsimha, which is quoted in the Prayogaratna of Nārāyaṇabhatta and is therefore not later than the first quarter of the 16th century, cites Haradatta’s explanation of Áp. Gr. S. (on pravāsād-etya putra sya sirah parigȚhya japati' etc.) and contrasts it with Nārāyana's view. The Subodhini of Viśveśvarabhatta (about 1375 A. D.) on Mit. ( Yāj. II. 132 ) quotes certain smộti passages as found in the vștti of Apastamba which are found in Haradatta's gloss.1091

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Hence it follows that Haradatta cannot be later than about 1300 A. D. The fact that Haradatta hardly ever names any commentator except perhaps Devasvāmin, the Bhàșyakára of Āpastamba-gļhya, and that he holds antiquated views about the widow's right to succeed to her deceased husband's estate are strong arguments in favour of the view that Haradatta is com paratively an early writer. Hardly any writer after Vijñāneśvara assigns the same position to the widow as Haradatta does. Hence it appears that Haradatta could not have flourished much later than 1100 A. D. So he must be placed between 1100-1300 A.D., very probably near the earlier limit than the later one. 
One important question is as to the identity of Haradatta, the commentator of the Dharma and Gșhya sútras and Haradatta, the author of the Padamañjari, a commentary on the Käsikā of Vamana and Jayāditya. Bühler felt uncertain about the identity. Šankarabhatta in his Dvaita-nirnaya speaks of Haradatta as expounding 1092 a karikā of Hari ( Vakyapadiya III. p. 260, Benares ed.) and also speaks of Haradatta as the author of the Ujjvala and the Mitaksarā without making any distinction between the two. This shows that he regarded the two as identical. Haradatta in his commentaries on the Dharmasútras gives far more attention to grammar than almost any other commentator of Dharma śāstra.1093 His grammatical disquisition on Ap. Dh. S, I. 2. 5. 18 (plāvanam ca nămno' etc. ) is almost identical with the Pada maũjari on Panini VIII. 2. 83 ('pratyabhivadesudre”). On Ap. Dh. S. II. 7.17. 17 he quotes a verse as from the grammarians for defining the location of the udicyas.1094 The Madhaviya Dhătu

vrtti mentions the Padamañjari. From this it follows that the Padamasjari was composed before 1300 A. D. Dr. Belvalkar places Haradatta, the author of the Padamañjarī, about 1100 A. D.1095 The learned editor of the Anāvila in the Trivandrum Series points out that, as Haradatta is quoted in the Puruşakara which in its turn is mentioned in the Dhātu-vitti of Madhava and as Saranadeva, the author of the Durghața-vștti, who wrote in šake 1095, cites the Jainendra and Kaiyata but not Haradatta nor the Padamañjari, Haradatta wrote about the close of the 12th century A. D. These circumstances render it highly probable (if not certain ) that Haradatta, the commentator of the Dharma sútras, is the same as the author of the Padamañjari and that he flourished between 1100 and 1300 A. D. and probably about 1200 A. D. The Smộticandrikā twice refers to the bhäşya of the Apa stamba-dharma-sútra.1096 Haradatta's commentary is styled výtti and not bhāsya and the citations do not occur in his work. Hence it appears that the Smsticandrikă did not know Haradatta's works and the latter could not have flourished much earlier than the Smộti-candrika. 
In the Padamañjari Haradatta is said to have been the son of Padma (Rudra )-kumāra, younger brother of Agoikumāra and a pupil of Aparajita.1097 In his Padamañjari Haradatta employs the word “kūcimañci' which is a Telugu word.1098 The Bhavi syottarapurāņa printed in Grantha characters contains 12 chapters ( 54th to 65th ) and the Sivarahasya printed in the said characters has one chapter (17th ) which set out the life ( carita) of a Haradattācārya. It is stated there that Haradattācārya's original name was Sudarsana, that he was the son of Vasudeva and that

he died 3979. years after Kaliyuga began 1099 (i. e. 878 A. D.). This Haradattācārya, being the son of Vasudeva, was not the same as the author of the Padamañjari, who was the son of Padmakumara. This earlier Haradatta may probably be the same as the Haradattācārya cited as an authority in the Sarvadarśana samgraha on the Nakulisa-pasupatadarsana.1100 Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 33 ) identifies without sufficient foundation the Haradatta cărya of the Sarvadarśana-samgraha with Haradatta, the com mentator of Ápastamiba and Gautama. 
A work called Hari-hara-tāratamya and another called Caturvedatātparya-saṁgraha are ascribed to a Haradatta. Of the latter there is a ms. in the Deccan College collection (No. 109 of 1871-72 ), which contains 154 verses of fine penmanship. The first and last are given below.1101 Whether these two works were composed by Haradatta, the commentator of the Dharma sútras, it is difficult to say. In the latter work the author sings a hymn of praise to Siva as the supreme deity, points out how the Vedic mantras refer to him, how the various rites are meant for him, refers to the mythological representations of Siva as Kirata, or as wearing skin etc. All the verses upto 143 are in the Vasantatilakā metre, while towards the end there are a few verses in other metres such as Sikharini and Rathoddhată. He was a staunch Saivite, 1102 though the hymn breathes a spirit of tolerance and sympathy for different religious and philosophical

Hemādri and Madhava are the Castor and Pollux in the galaxy of daksinātya writers on Dharmaśāstra. Hemădri is a very voluminous writer. He is the author of the Caturvarga cintamani, an encyclopedia of ancient religious rites and observances. From ancient times in India the goals of human life (puruşārthas ) were said to be four viz. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokșa ( and were spoken of as Caturvarga'). Moksa could be attained only by a few men but as to the other three ( spoken of as Trivarga ) all could secure them, according to their abilities and activities (vide Manu II. 224). This subject of Purusărthas has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 2-11, Vol. III. pp. 8-10 and 241-43 and Vol. V. pp. 1626-1632. According to the statements contained in the work itself the author intended to treat Dharmasastra in five sections, called vrata, dàna, tirtha, moksa and parišesa. 1103 The Parisesa khanda was divided into four parts, viz., Devatā, Kålanirņaya, Karmavipaka, Laksaņasamuccaya.104 The Caturvarga-cintamani has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica Series. Four volumes containing 6 parts and covering about 6009 pages have been so far printed. The second and third volumes have two parts each. The fourth volume which deals with prāvascitta does not appear to be the work of Hemadri.l105 The work so far published is concerned with vrata, dầna, śrāddha and kāla (latter two being parts of the Pariseşa-khanda ). That portion of the Caturvarga cintāmaņi which was intended to treat of tirtha and mokșa has not yet come to light. It is extremely doubtful whether the author

was able to carry out his gigantic scheme Mss. of portions of the great work are described in the catalogues under vairous names, e.g. I. O. Cat. No. 1379, p. 407 on santikapaustikāni is the same subject that is treated in vratakhanda pp. 1003ff., though there are considerable variations between the Ms. and the printed text. 
Hemădri's is a standard work on the subjects with which he deals. He quotes most profusely from smộtis and puràņas and Dames a host of writers. He appears to have been a profound student of the Parvamimarisa. The discussions in his work, parti cularly on śrāddha and kāla, cannot be well understood without thorough acquaintance with the numerous nyāyas of the mimässä which he employs at every step. To illustrate this a few instances may be cited at random. On pp. 137, 143, 156, 159 of his Kala. nirnaya (vol. III part 2 ) he makes use of four different nyāyas of. the mimamsā. 1100 The eminent commentators and nibandhakāras on dharmaśāstra and other works named by him are given below.1107 It is somewhat remarkable that though he quotes Aparārka and the Smsti-candrikà scores of times he hardly ever mentions by name the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara. Though he does not promise a treatment of vyavabára, here and there he makes sallies into the domain of vyavahàra. For example, he quotes the well-known sutra of Gautama ( 10. 39 ) on the sources

of ownership and holds a lengthy discussion thereon.1108 In ano ther place he digresses into the question of the various kinds of stridhana and their devolution (vol. III, part 1, pp. 530-531 ). He was of opinion that everyone, to whatever śàkhā he may belong, should perform śrāddha in accordance with the directions thereon in all säkhās, kalpa and gļhya sūtras, smstis, purāṇas and usages.1108 He makes the important statement1110 that a person following any particular Vedic sākhā may enter into alliance by marriage with any other person of the same country following another Vedic šākha. 
Hemådri gives some account of himself in his work. The Mss. present great variations from the printed text. He belonged to the Vatsagotra. 1111 He was the grandson of Vasudeva and the son of Kamadeva. The introductions to the khandas contain fulsome praise of Hemādri. One verse says that Hemådri scored out by showering wealth on poor people the lines that Brahmå had drawn on their forehead at the time of their birth ( foredooming them to eternal poverty) and that Brahmā acquiesces in such conduct of Hemādri."112 Another verse says that none existed, exists or will exist surpassing Hemădri.1113 He describes himself as in charge of the imperial

records of Mahadeva, the Yadava king of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad ).1114 In the colophons and the body of the work also he is described as the karanādhisvara of Mahadeva, as highly honoured by the king and as a minister (mantrin) of the king. 1115 He gives in the introduction to the Vratakhanda a detailed pedigree of the Yådavas of Devagiri. In the section on kāla (vol. III, part 2) he starts with Sanghana (i. e. Singhana of the inscriptions ), then speaks of his son Jaitrapala (i. e. Jaitugi ), his son Krsna (or Kanhara) and lastly of Maha deva, son of the younger brother of Krsna. This is not the place to go into the genealogy of the Yadavas. There are some discrepancies between the genealogy as presented by Hemādri and as gathered from the inscriptions and numerous copperplate grants of the Yādavas. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. I, part 2, pp. 248–249 for Hemādri and pp. 268-275 for extracts from the Vratakhanda, pp. 252 and 519 for two pedigrees of the Devagiri Yadavas and pp. 511-534 for history. The following may be consulted for the principal grants of the Yadavas :- Ind. Ant. vol. 17, p. 117 ( Kalasbudruk plate of Bhillama dated sake 948 or 1025 A. D.), E. I. vol. III p. 110 (Bahal inscription of Singhaņa dated sake 1144), E. I. vol. III pp. 217–18 (Gadag inscription of Bhillama dated sake 1113 i. e. 1191 A. D.), Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 68 (grant of Kysņa or Kanhara dated 1249-50 A. D.), Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 314 ( Paithan plate of Rāmacandra dated sake 1193), E. I. vol. XIII, p. 198 ( Thana plate of Ramacandra dated śake 1194 i. e. 1272 A. D.), E. I. vol. XIX, p. 20 ( Mamdapur inscription of Kanhara dated sake 1172 i. e. 1250 A. D. wherein his younger brother Mahadeva is described as yuvarāja). Mahadeva reigned from 1260 to 1271 and Rămacandra, the son of Kssna, from 1271 to 1309 A. D. Since in the Caturvarga-cintamani Hemàdri is said to be the keeper of the state-records of Mahadeva, that work must have been

composed at some time between 1260 and 1270 A. D. There are contemporary records available showing that Hemadri was in high favour not only with Mahadeva but also with his successor Rāmacandra. The Thana plate of Rămacandra (dated sake 1194, i. e. 1272 A. D. ) records the grant of a village called Vaul in Sasati ( modern Sāsti in the Thana District) to thirty-two brāhmaṇas by Acyuta Nāvaka of the Gautama gotra and descendant of Jalhana, who was the governor of Konkan, and describes!116 Hemādri as one who had attained a preeminent position in the government through the favour of Rāmacandra and as one who was in charge of all ( state ) records and was the foremost minister. 
Hemadri is frequently cited by Raghunandana in his Smsti tattva and rarely criticized ; vide (vol. 1). Tithi pp. 1, 11, 16, 18, 120; Sraddha pp. 285, 286; Jyotistattva 678, Mala® 755, 836; Samskara 891; (vol. II) Ekādasi 37, 44, 90 (cr.), Udváha 145, Suddhi 273, 339 (mentions Parisesakhanda ) 356. 
Vide a paper in J. O. R. ( Madras) vol. XII pp. 46-60 by Dr. P. Srinivasachar on the Yadavas of Devagiri, that shows that the last dated Inscription of Kssra is dated 12th April 1259, that Mahadeva succeeded him and that some time elapsed between the death of Mahadeva and the accession of Ramacandra, and that Hemadri was in great favour with both Mahadeva and Råmacandra. The pedigree ( relevant to this writer ) is Bhillama Jaitugi--Singhana (and also Simha, Simhaņa, Simhala )-Jaitugi II Krsna (also written in Inscriptions as Kanhåra, Kanharadeva, Kandharadeva, dates ranging from sake 1169 to 1175) and Mahadeva who succeeded Kļşņa; (Kļşna's son Rāmacandra or Ramarāya, one date is šake 1199 )—Sankaradeva succeeded in sake 1232 ( 1310-11 A. D.) and was killed by Malik Kafar two years later. Vide JBBRAS vol. XII pp. 1-50 ( by Dr. Fibet). It is probable that Mahadeva, brother of Kțsna, succeeded because Krşna's son Rāmacandra was very young. 
Hemādri is credited with a commentary on Saunaka's Prana vakalpa.1117 He appears to have written a sràdha-kalpa according

to the rules of Katyāyana which is distinct from his Śraddha khauda (vide Calcutta Sanskrit College mss. cat., vol. II, p. 163, No. 217 and Stein's cat. p. 105). Hemadri also wrote a commentaryllis called Kaivalyadipikā on the Muktăphala of Vopadeva, the famous author of the Mugdhabodha grammar. The Muktăphala embodies the philosophy of the Bhagavata purāņa in 19 adhyâyas and 784 verses ( and a few lines in prose in 5th and 6th chapters ). Vopadeva was a friend and protege of Hemădri, who wrote several works at the encouragement of the latter. He says that he wrote the Harililā (published in the Calcutta Oriental Series No. 3), an index of the Bhāgavata for pleasing the minister Hemādri.1118 Verse 54 in the Upasamhārā dhyāya in the edition of the Muktāphala expressly states that Hemādri induced Vopadeva, son of the physician Kesava and pupil of the scholar Dhaneša, to compose the Muktāphala. Verse 53 also is interesting:- TT TË THET (Arga: Tiga HTF: 949T ata: radar2007: II. Rāma means Dāšarathi Rāma and Rama candra (Yadava king). Hemādri means mountain Meru and also the author Hemādri. 120 
There is a learned commentary on the Raghuvamsa by a Hemādri. Mr. P. K. Gode (in ABORI vol. XIV pp. 126-128 ) adduces arguments for establishing that the commentator is different from the author of the Caturvarga-cintamani. There is a commentary on this work called Viveka with which both

Hemādri and Madhusudana-Sarasvati had something to do. 1121 Hemādri also wrote a commentary called Ayurvedarasāyana on the Astārgahțdaya of Vägbhata. 
Altogether Hemädri was a towering personality. His name is associated throughout the Maratha Country with the construc tion of numerous temples having a peculiar style of architecture. He is also credited with having invented the Modi script. Within a few decades his Caturvarga-cintamani, particularly its dāna and vrata sections, came to be looked upon as the standard work in the whole of the Deccan and southern India Madhava in his Kālanirpaya (p. 67 ) expressly mentions the Vratakhanda of Hemādri as an authority. This work was composed about 1340 A. D. In an inscription of Bhāskara alias Bhavadūra, son of Bukka I, dated sake 1291 (i. e. 1369 A. D.) the king is described as making various gifts following the composition of Hemàdri. 1122 This is obviously a reference to his danakhanda and establishes that long before 1369 A. D. Hemādri had become a standard author in the Telugu country. The Vanapalli plate of Anna-Vema dated sake 1300 (about 1380 A. D.) describes Vema as giving the various gifts in Hemādri and his son as one who observed the rratas and dānas 123 described by Hemādri. Pedda-Komati-Vema is described in a grant of sake 1344 as eager in bestowing gifts described in the rules of Hemādri. 1124 Hemadri is quoted in the Madanapārijāta,1125 the Dvaitanirnaya of Sankarabhatta, the Nirņayasindhu and other works.

89. Kullikabhatta 
Kullüka's commentary on the Manusmộti styled the Man varthamuktavali is the most famous of all commentaries on Manu. It has been printed several times. In the following the Nirnayasāgara edition of 1909 has been relied upon. Kullūka's commentary is concise and lucid and his remarks are always to the point. He avoids all unnecessary discussions and is never prolix. He was not however original. He drew upon the com mentaries of Medhătithi and Govindarāja and incorporated a great deal from them into his own work without acknowledgment. For example, on Manu XI. 95 he simply summarises the remarks1126 of Govindaraja and cites only one out of the several quotations that are found in Govindarija's Manu-tika. He severely criticizes both Medhātithi and Govindaraja, particularly the latter. He frequently pours ridicule on the latter ( vide note 903° above). At the end of his commentary he saysilar that Medhatithi's skill lay in expounding what texts were authorita tive and of substance and what were not so. Govindarāja in concise words explained the hidden meaning of the brief text ( of Manu ), while Dharanidhara had his own method of expla nation which was independent of previous tradition; and there fore he undertook to write a commentary that would clearly set forth the real meaning of Manu. He was very proud of his achievement and says that neither Medhatithi nor Govindarāja nor other commentators explained in the way he did and that explanatory material like his would be difficult to find else

where. 1129 He not only criticizes Govindarāja severely but also points out the mistakes of Medhātithi ( as on Manu 1. 71 and 103, II. 101 ).1129 He notices the explanations of Medhătithi and Govindaraja hundreds of times, discusses various readings and his commentary deserves to a considerable extent the eulogy pronounced by Sir William JonesliBU “At length appeared Cullaca Bhatta, who, after a painful course of study and the collation of numerous manuscripts, produced a work of which it may perhaps be said very truly that it is the shortest yet the most luminous, the least ostentatious yet the most learned, the deepest yet the most agreeable, cominentary ever composed on any author, ancient or modern." 
Among the authors and works quoted by him (besides the usual smstis ) are the following :-Garga (on II. 6), Govindarāja, Dharanidhara, Bhāskara (bhāșyakára of the Vedāntasūtras, on I. 8 and 15), Bhojadeva (on VIJI. 184), Medhătithi, Vamana (author of the Kašika), Bhattavārtika-kst (on XII. 106 ), Višvarūpa (the commentator of Yājñavalkya, on II. 189 and V. 68 ). The Visvarüpa that he quotes on Manu V. 215 is the lexicographer and not the jurist as Aufrecht (in his great catalogue ) appears to hold. 
He gives us a little information about himself in the intro ductory verse. 1131 He came of a Várendra Brāhmaṇa family of Bengal (Gauda) residing in Nandana and was the son of Bhatta Divakara. He wrote his commentary in Kāsi in the company of

Pandits. On Manu VI. 14 he mentions the names of certain vegetables that were current in Malwa and among the Vahikas. 1132 
It appears that Kullūka also composed a digest called Smộtisāgara. A Ms. of a portion of it called Sraddhasāgara exists in the Calcutta Sanskrit College ( Cat. vol. II, p. 405, No. 446). In this his Āsaucasāgara and Vivadasågara are referred to. 
I secured a transcript of the ms, of the Sraddhasāgara in the Calcutta Sanskrit College through the kindness of the Principal. The Srāddhasāgara deals with the following subjects:-- definition of śrāddha; whether it is of the nature of yāga, dāna and homa; various kinds of śrāddhas such as nitya, naimittika &c.; the proper and improper places for śrāddha; the proper times for śraddha; Astakā-śrāddha ; sūdras can perform astak, and other śràddhas; intercalary month; who are pankti-pāvana brāhmanas; meaning of nimantrana and amantraņa; the number of brāhmanas to be invited; the darbhas; śrāddhadevatās; the sacred thread etc. 
The Sraddhasāgara is full of Purvamimāṁsà discussions. The author says that he wrote it and the other two works (Vivādasāgara and Asaucasāgara ) at the order of his father. He quotes profusely from the Mahabharata, the Mahāpurānas and Upapurinas and from the dharmasútras and metrical smitis. He names the Kalpataru oftener than any other nibandhakāra. The other authors and works named are: Bhojadeva, Halāyudha (probably the author of Prakāśa on the Sraddhakalpasūtra of Katyāyana ), Jikana, Kamadhenu, Medhătithi, Sankhadhara. In one place we have a reference to Prabhakara and Kamalakara bhatta (on Kala and Kāma being devatás ) and in another place to Gauda-Maithila-Mayük ha-bhattāḥ (which are probably marginal notes creeping into the ms. or refer to authors other than the well-known ones). He refers to the opinion of his own guru in opposition to that of the Kalpataru. 
The date of Kullûka cannot be settled with certainty. Bühler held that he lived probably in the 15th century (S. B. E. vol. XXV. p. CXXXI ). Ghose (Hindu Law, 3rd edition p. XVI ) and M. M. Chakravarti (JASB 1915, p. 345 ) are of the same opinion. In 1. L. R. 48 Cal. 643 Sir Asutosh Mukerji places Kullūka in the 15th century (at p. 688 ). As Kullûka mentions Bhojadeva,

759 
Govindarāja, Kalpataru and Halāyudha he is certainly later than about 1200 A. D. Raghunandana1133 several times mentions Kullûkabhatta (and sometimes criticizes him also ); vide (vol. I) Sraddha 225 (Cri. on Manu III. 257), 226, Āhnika 353, 454; Prāyaścitta 472, 530; Samskāra 893, 94, 903; ( vol. II ) Udváha p. 144. The Darda-viveka of Vardhamāna quotes Kullūka about fifty times and oftener than any other work or author except Ratnakara. Árinātha's com. on the Dāyabhäga refutes the view of Kullūka. The Śrāddha-kriya-kaumudi of Govindananda refers to Kullūka's explanation of the word åkāöksan'as Vikşamāṇaḥ' in Manu III. 258. The Rājaniti-ratnākara of Candeśvara quotes the explanation of Kulluka.1134 Therefore Kullúka must have flourished before 1300 A. D. Kullūka in his by no means small work nowhere refers to the Dáyabhāga, though he himself came of a Bengal family. This silence is explicable in two ways. As we have seen, Kulluka wrote in Kasi and not in Bengal. Therem fore if he flourished not long after Jimutavāhana, it is quite natural that writing in Benares he had not heard of the Daya bhāga or read it. It has been shown above that Jimütavāhana probably wrote about 1100-1150 A. D. Therefore Kullüka flourished between 1150 and 1300 A. D. and probably wrote about 1250 A. D. M. M. Chakravarti is not sure as to how early Kulloka flourished but opines that he could not have flourished later than the first quarter of the 15th century (JASB 1915, p. 345 1. 1).

is one of the earliest among the mediaeval Maithila nibandhakaras. He is the author of several works which will be briefly noticed, 
The Acārädarśa of Sridatta was printed in Benares at the Divakara Press and by the Venkateśvara Press in Bombay in saṁvat 1961. It is a manual of the daily religious duties of the followers of the white Yajurveda ( Väjasaneyins ),1135 such as ācamana, brushing the teeth, morning bath, saindhyā, japa, brahma yajña, tarpana, daily worship of gods, vaiśvadeva, feeding guests etc. Among the works and writers named are the following 138.-- Ācāra-cintămani, Kalpataru, Kamadhenu, Kālikāpurana, Ganesa mjśra, Rājā (probably Bhojadeva ), Smstimahārņava, Harihara and Halāyudha-nibandha. There is a commentary on this work called Ācārādarsabodhini composed by Gauripati or Gaurjśa, son of Dāmodara Maithila, at Benares in 1640 A. D. (Dr. Bhandar kar's report, 1883-84, p. 347). In this work he uses several vernacular words; e. g. he says that 'Sāla' tree is known as Sagavanal137 ( in the vernacular ). 
Sridatta's work called 'Chandogâhnika' was printed by the Niruayasågara Press (Bombay, 1930 ). It summarizes at the end the principal topics viz, rinsing the mouth, bath, morning sandhyā, five daily yajñas, bhojana (midday meal), resting thereafter, evening sandhya, evening meal, repeating the Veda, going to bed. In the Introductory verse he states: looking into the smstis, Puranas, Grhyasútras and the nibandhas of Bhūpåla (i.e. king Bhoja) and Gopāla ( the author of the Kāmadhenu ) I shall set out the alinika ( daily rites prescribed ) for Sãmavedins. At the end also he states that he studied all the pibandhas of Bhupüla and others. It is a small work (63 printed pages), but it quotes, besides the well-known sūtras, smstis and the Mahābhārata the following works : Karma pradipa (frequently pp. 19, 47, 50, 53, 60), Kamadhenu (pp. 5, 7, 8, 12, 46 &c.), Kalpataru (pp. 4, 5, 36, 58,63 &c.), Chandoga

He referes to his own work 
Sraddhakalpa' (p. 53). For a small work like the Chando gåhnika the author quotes a very large number of authorities. It may be noted that this work specifies (on pp. 45-46) at some length the Aparùdhas that Bhagavatas should not be guilty of and explains the word Bhagavata in several ways. 
The Pit;bhakti is a manual on the Sraddha rites for students of the Yajurveda. It was based 138 on the Katiyakalpa with Karka's bhāsya thereon and on the works of Gopāla and Bhupala (i. e. Bhojadeva ). It is frequently quoted in the Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara. Among the writers named are (besides those that occur in the Acārādarsa also ): Pitphitàkaraņikāra, Nārāyaṇa vịtti (on Asvalāyana Gr. S.), Mitākṣarā, Ratnakarandikā, Vidhi puspamālā (26 a), śubhākara, Smstimañjari, Smstimañjūsà, Halāyudha's Sraddhădhyāya. This work first treats of the details of the Pārvanaśrāddha, then of ekoddista, of the monthly sräddhas, the srāddha on the 11th day after death, of Sapindi karana, of abhyudayika śrāddha.

The Sraddhakalpa was composed by him for the Sama vedins. It is referred to in his Samayapradipal139 and Pitbhakti (folio 33b ).

History of Dharmaśāstra 
The Samayapradipa treats of the proper times for various vratas. 1149 It is divided into three chapters (paricchedas ). The first is called Samayapariccheda and dilates upon the definition of vrata, on the procedure about fasts, nakta and the vratas of Ganesa and other deities, the second is called Samvatsara krtya-pariccheda and treats of vratás from the pratipadā to the amāvāsya in the several months and the third is called prakirnaka (miscellaneous ) dealing with the vratas on sankranti (the Sun's passage into another Zodiacal sign) etc. In this work Sridatta often refers to the views of the Gaudas and contrasts them with his own. He also refers to Gaudanibandha. No other writers or works except those that are already enumerated under Acăràdarśa and Pit;bhakti are named in this work. On folio 7a there is a name which is somewhat indistinct and appears to be “Mitāmitrādibhiḥ'. The Samayapradipa is mentioned in the Kștya-ratnākara (pp. 400, 479, 505 ) of Candeśvara and in Śūlapāņi's Durgotsava-vivekall4i Sridatta is more frequently quoted in the Sraddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindānanda than almost any other author or work. 
As Sridatta names the Kalpataru, Harihara and Halayudha's work on sraddha he must have flourished later than 1200 A. D. As Candeśvara mentions his Samayapradipa, Sridatta must have flourished before the first quarter of the 14th century. If Ganesamiśra mentioned in the Acāradarśa be the same as Ganesvaramiśra, the author of Sugatisopana and uncle of Cande śvara ( which appears extremely probable), then Sridatta flouri shed a short time before Candeśvara and must have composed his works between 1275 and 1510 A. D. 
Śridatta affords hardly any information about himself or his family. But as he refers to certain writers by the general word Gaudāḥ' (pakvatailam na duşyatiti Gaudāḥ p. 12 of Chandogàhnika) it may be assumed that he was not a Gauda but a Maithila.

He was liberal enough to assert that a südra 142 can perform Vaišvadeva and the offering of bali, but he cannot adopt the procedure of Sakala as it includes Vedamantras; he can, however, perform those rites with 'namaḥ' as the Mantra and relies on Yāj. I. 12 and Vispupurāna in support. The Samayapradipa of Sridatta is quoted by Raghunandana in (vol. I), Mala p. 839 and (vol. II) in Ekādasi p. 44. 
It appears that there was another Maithila writer called Śridattamisra, son of Nâgeśvaranišra, who composed the Ekågnidānapaddhati and one or two other works (Hp. Nepal cat. p. 129). The Nepal Ms. of the Ekāgnidāna-paddhati was copied in La-Sam 299 (Lakşmanasena era 299, i. e. 1418 A.D.). Vide Hp. Nepal cat. XII, 45 and 129. So this Sridatta flourished towards the end of the 14th century in the reign of Devasimha son of Bhavesa. Vide JASB for 1915 pp. 379-381 and 388-390 for Sridatta.

Candesvara is the most prominent figure among Maithila nibandhakāras on Dharmaśāstra. He compiled an extensive digest called Smstiratnākara or simply Ratnākara. This digest was divided into seven sections viz, on kệtya, dàna, vyavahāra, śuddhi, půjā, vivāda and grhastha. 1143 Out of these the Vivàda ratnākara dealing with dâyabhāga and the other titles of law (vyavahārapadas ) has been printed in the B. I. Series and has been translated into English by Mr. G. C. Sarkar and by Mr. Justice Digambara Chatterjee. The Vivādaratnākara of Candesvara and the Vivādacintamani of Vacaspati are of para

The Kștya-ratnākara deals in 22 tarangas with the discussion of Dharma ( its real nature, its rewards, means of knowing it and the occasions for it), the various vratas and observances in the several months from Caitra, the observances in the inter calary month, various vratas on the several days of the week, the Sun's passage into a new sign, eclipse on the new-moon day etc. This work is referred to in his Dànaratnakara, which in its turn is quoted in the Grhastha-ratnākara.1145 The work was printed in the Bibliotheca Indica Series in 1926. He belittles Kalpataru, Kamadhenu and Pārijāta. This was probably the first of the seven Ratnākaras, since it is mentioned first in the verse quoted below1148 and since it has a very large number of Introductory verses. 
The Gshastha-ratnākara is a very extensive work in 68 tarangas on the duties of householders. The work was printed in the Bibliotheca Indica Series in 1928, while the first vol. of H. of Dh. was in the Press. It is a large work in 591 pages. It has only two Introductory verses, the last quarter of the 2nd saying that this Ratnākara is full of Mimāmsă. Verses (3-20) enume rate briefly the topics of the 68 tarangas (waves i. e, chapters ) of this (Ratnākara which word also means 'sea'), which are :

Besides this digest Candeśvara compiled several other works. 
Kệtyacintāmaņi is one of such works. It is a question when it was composed. In his Gșhastharatnakara he says that certain architectural and decorative constructions called Srivksa, Vardha mâna and Nandyāvarta have been spoken of by him in the Krtyacintàmaņi. 1148 But the Krtyacintāmaņi says that he has already composed the seven ratnakaras1149

The Kștyacintamani is divided into sections called prakāšas. It deals with astronomical matters in relation to the performance of several religious ceremonies and samskāras, such as tàrāśuddhi, the intercalary month, garbhādhāna, simantonnayana, birth of a child on the Mula nakṣatra, the rites on the 6th day after birth, nănakarana, the movements of Saturn, Sun's passage from one sign into another, the results of eclipses etc. The Krtyacintāmņi expressly states that it was composed after all the seven Ratnakaras.

Another work of Candesvara, the Rajapitiratnakara, was published at Patna (1924 ) by Mr. K. P. Jayasval with a learned introduction dealing with the personal history of Candeśvara, his relations with the Maithila kings and the mediaeval Indian litera ture on politics. It appears that Candeśvara did not contemplate the writing of a work on politics when he compiled his great digest. He wrote the work at the command of the king Bhavesa or ( Bhaveśvara ) of Mithilă.1158 The work contains 16 tarangas ( waves, i. e. chapters ) on the following subjects :- definition of a king, different grades of kings, the eighteen vices or calamities for kings, duties of kings; the characteristics and duties of amatyas (councillors ); the characteristics of purohita; the characteristics and duties of a prádvivāka (Judge); the members of the ball of justice ( sabhyas), their number and qualifications; concerning forts; the time and place and accessories of the settlement of royal policy; concerning the state treasury; the army; the com mander-in-chief and the discipline of the army; ambassadors, allies, and spies; the general obligations of kings, conflict of Dharmaśāstra and Arthasastra, the six gunas-saindhi etc., the mandala of kings; the king's power of punishment; abdication by king, the heir-apparent, impartibility of the kingdom; the eldest son's right to succeed, the seven constituent elements of the state; obligation towards the poor, the helpless etc.; the coronation of the heir-apparent or his investiture.

There are two more works composed by Candeśvara viz., the Dànavākyāvali and the Sivavákyávali. Vide I. O. Cat. p. 1409, No. 3724 for the latter and Häraprasad Shastri's Cat. ( 1925) vol. III No. 2393 pp. 465-66 for the Dānavākyāvali. Raghunandana quotes Dànavākyàvali in (vol. II ) Udvāha p. 138 ( which is most probably this work of Candeśvara). 
Candesvara names in his works, particularly in the Krtyarat nakara and the Vivādaratnākara, a host of writers and works. In his great digest he drew largely upon five predecessors and incorporated often without acknowledgment much or almost all that was valuable in them. These five predecessors were the Kamadhenu, the Kalpataru, the Pārijāta, the Prakāśa (i. e. Smsti mahārnava) and Haläyudha, all of which he quotes scores of of times. At the end of the Vivādaratnākara he boasts that what. ever is of the essence in the above five works and even more is comprehended in his single work the Ratnākara,1151 Dr. Jayasval rightly points out (in Intro. to Răjanitiratnākara p. p.) From Lakşmidhara's Kalpataru on Vyavahāra Candeśvara borrows into his Vivādaratnākara practically the whole book'. The boastful references to bimself and highly slighiing remarks about Kåma dhenu, Kalpataru and other works which occur in his works are felt by modern readers as very objectionable and offensive, since he appropriates without express acknowledgement the valuable parts of such works as the Kamadhenu, Kalpataru and others. 
In several papers Mr. (now Dr.) Bhabatosh Bhattacharya attempts to show Candeśvara's indebtedness to others (vide the following) and also offers some other matters about Candesvara and others : (1) Candesvara's indebtedness to Ballalasena' in 1. C. vol. XI pp. 141-44; (2) Candesvara's indebtedness to Śridatta in N. I. A. (Poona Vol. V No. 2 pp. 36-38 ); (3) The Danasāgara and Danaratnākara' in the Proceedings of the 15th All-India Oriental Conference (Bombay) pp. 281-83; (4) Supplementary portion of Gșhastharatnākara in I. C. vol. XIII pp. 79-84; (5) Candeśvara's own account of himself

I have to protest against a careless remark of the writer on p. 171 'Though the Gshastharatpakara of Candeśvara was published in 1928 he has not utilized the printed edition, but consulted the incomplete Deccan College Ms. of the same, which has only folios 30, 72–113 and has thus failed to supply the additional information contained in its Introductory verses'.

Here the writer has done an injustice to me. The first volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra' was published at Poona by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in August 1930. It contains 760 pages, the first 466 pages being more important than the rest; the remaining pages contain long lists of the works and authors on Dharmaśāstra. In the first part of 1926 was published by the same Institute the Vyavahāramayukha edited by me (text and exhaustive notes ). That is, the work of writing and seeing through the press the first volume of the H. of Dh. was at the most spread over about four years and a half from 1926. Candeśvara's career and works are dealt with in pp. 366-372. The pages must have been written in the last months of 1927 or the first part of 1928. The press was in Poona and I, who examined three proofs of each form, was in Bombay and this took time. There are several fallacies in Mr. Bhattacharya's remarks. A work in Sans krit published in Calcutta in 1928 may not be known at all elsewhere for years, unless the publisher sends of his own accord copies or advertisements to different parts of India or unless writers cr libraries and learned societies in other provinces place general orders with publishers in Calcutta to send books pub lished by them. The only Library in Bombay in those days that contained a large number of Sanskrit Mss, or printed Sanskrit works was that of the Asiatic Society; but even that Society had and has limited resources, as it was and is a general library and hardly ever placed general orders for Sanskrit works with publishers in other and distant parts of India. There are thou sands of authors and works in Sanskrit on Dharmaśāstra ( as pp. 507-760 of the first volume will indicate). I selected only 113 out of them for treatment in 466 pages and relied on printed works and Mss. available chiefly in Bombay and Poona. I nowhere promised that I would scour all Sanskrit Mss, or printed works in

the whole of India and elsewhere. In this particular instance there is nothing to show that the work was even printed when I wrote the pages on Candeśvara or sent them to the Press in Poona. 
Among the authors and works mentioned in his seven ratna karas, those mentioned below deserve to be noted.1153 In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 348 (at p. 356) the learned judges appear to hold that the Părijāta mentioned in the Vivadacintamani is the Madanapärijata. But this is obviously a mistake (vide pp.655-56 above on Parijata), Besides these in his Rajapitiratnākara he names Kāmandaka, Kullūkabhatta, Pallava and Pallavakära, Srikara. What is printed as Natasutra in the Vivadaratnakara (p. 477) is really Lata (i.e. Lätyāyana Srautasūtra). Candeśvara mentions many vernacular words (e. g. Krityaratnakara pp. 109, 111, 306, 338, 443). 
We learn a great deal about the family and personal history of Candeśvara from his works. The Vivādaratnākara in the intro duction and in the colophon tells us that Candeśvara was a mantrin (a minister ), was entrusted with the office of minister for peace and war, that he conquered Nepal and weighed himself against gold on the banks of the Vagvati in sake 1236 (1314 A. D.).1153 There are more or less similar colophons at the end of

the Rajapitiratnakara and the other ratnākaras. The grand-father of Candesvara was Devāditya,1154 who was minister of Hara simbadeva of Tirhut and who belonged to the Kārņāta family. Two families ruled over Mithila viz, the Kārņāta dynasty from 1097 A. D. to 1324 A. D. followed by the Kāmeśvara dynasty. The first started with Nânyadeva and ended with Harisimha deva (vide JBORS vol. IX p. 300 ff. and vol. X. p. 37 and JBRS vol. 43 for 1957 pp. 1-6 by Dr. R. C. Majumdar and · Kärnāta rulers of Mithilā' in the same volume pp. 61-63 by Mr. Kamal Narain Jha). Harisimhadeva had to retire before the Delhi Sultan Ghiasuddin Tughlak and established himself in Nepal which happened in December 1324 A. D, as the note from the Pañji historian of Mithilā (vide note 1161 below) shows and ruled there for several years. 
The correct name of the king was Harisimhadeva, though the printed Krtyaratnākara exhibits the name as Harasimhadeva (Intro. verse 4). It would be seen from the genealogy that Vidyāpati, famous for his padas in Maithili, was the son's son of Jayadatta, a first paternal cousin of andesvara. Vidyāpati in his Purusaparikșă, 2nd tale (Subuddhakathā ) narrates the story of Harisiṁhadeva. There is great confusion about the birth-date of Vidyāpati, some saying, that he was born in 1340, while others hold that his birth was in 1380 A. D. or 1390 A. D. Most hold that he died in 1448 A. D. It is unnecessary to give more details about him here. Vide I.

Besides his famous lyrical poems in Maithili some Sanskrit works are ascribed to him viz. Varşakrtya (which Raghuo in Mala in vol. I p. 823 mentions as Vidyāpati's ), Ganga vàkyāvali (Raghu vol.

Of these Gangavākyàvali, and Śaivasarvasvasāra are attributed to queen Visvasadevi and Dānavākyāvali to queen Dhiramati. Vide new 1. A. vol. VII pp. 49–57 by G. C. Basu and Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya's paper in the Proceedings of All-India Oriental Conference at Benares (in 1943-44) vol. II. pp. 288-297. The grant of the village Bisapi to Vidyāpati (now held by scholars as spurious) is set out by Grierson on p. 191 of his paper in I. A. vol. 14 pp. 182-196 on * Vidyāpati and his Contemporaries and Grierson in I. A. vol. 28 pp. 57–58 states that the grant is dated in La. Sam. 292 i. e. 1400-1 A. D. i. e. he holds that La. Sam. started in 1109 A. D. (vide above p. 733 for La. Sam.) and he sets out the Kāmesvara dynasty as follows. Pañjikāras mention four rulers after Viśvāsadevi, but as Vidyāpati does not mention them they are omitted here.

title of Rūpanārāyana, and founded a city called Sivasimha pura, also known as Gajaratha 
pura. There is no unanimity about the chronology of the rulers of the Kārņāta dynasty. 
The last three of the Kārnāta Dynasty are stated to have been Rămasimha, Saktisiṁha and Harisimha. But even bere there is a difficult problem. In the Inscription of Pratāpamalla (I. A. vol. IX pp. 184, 188, 189) a king named Bhūpålasimha is shown as liaving ruled between Saktisimha and Harisiṁha. The present author need not deal with that question here. We know from the Kętyaratnākaia (2nd Intro. verse quoted in note 1154 )

that Devāditya, the grand-father of Candesvara, was the chief minister of the king. After Devāditya his son Vireśvara became chief minister and Candeśvara, the eldest son of Vireśvara, held several offices such as chief justice, also minister for peace and war and chief minister ( vide note from Mitra's Notices vol. VI p. 67). As Candeśvara weighed himself against precious metals in sake 1236 (1314 A. D.), it follows that he must have been for at least several years a favourite minister of the king Harisimbadeva, to whom the Pañji historians of Mithila assign a reign of 20 years i. e. Harisimhadeva began to rule about 1304 A. D. Harisimha deva, being defeated, went to Nepal and the Delhi emperor put in his place Kāmesvara Rajapandita.1155 One of the sons of Devāditya was Vireśvara who was also a minister for peace and war of the same king and is said to have made grants to learned Bråhmaṇas in Râmapura (i. e. Simraon in Champaran District) and other cities (verse 10 of Kștyaratnākara). Mr. Jayasval points out in his introduction to the Rājaniti-ratnākara (i) that the correct name of the king was Harisiṁhadeva. Another son of Devăditya was Ganesvara who was younger than Vire svara and who was also a great minister and author of Suga tisopāna. A copy of this work bears the date La-sam (Laksmanasena era) 224 (i, e. 1343–44 A. D. ).1158 In the colophop of this work Devăditya is called 'mabámatta' (mahămātra ) and Ganesvara is styled mahārājādhirāja. In the Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara the Sugatisopana is said to be the work of one who was pratihastaka (deputy) of Bhavašarma 187 Candesvara was the son of Vireśvara and like his father and grandfather became minister of Harisjidhadeva. This must have happened about 1310 A. D., as he weighed himself in 1314 A. D. The Kștyaratnākara (verse 15) says that he touched the very idol of Pasupati in Nepal and worshipped it after conquering the country.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
From the Vyavahàraratnākara it appears that Candesvara was Chief Judge as well as Minister for peace and war.1188 Candesvara and his ancestors are highly praised for their libe rality1159 In the Dànaratnākara (verse 2 at the end) he is said to have rescued the earth submerged in the flood of Mlecchas. 1180 This probably refers to the defeat of some Mahomedan generals. Harisimhadeva was routed by Ghiasuddin Tughlak in 1324 and retired from Tirhut into 1181 Nepal. Hence it follows that the seven

Ratnakaras, some of which (like vivāda and dāna) refer to his weighing himself against gold in 1314 A. D. and his high position at the court of Harisiṁhadeva, were composed between 1314 and 1324 A. D. His Rājanitiratnakara was composed at the command of Bhaveśa. This last belonged to the line of the Kameśvara dynasty which began to rule Tirhut in the third quarter of the 13th century, in 1370 A. D. according to Mr. Jayasval (introduc tion to Rajanitiratnakara, r). Therefore the literary activities of Caņdeśvara extended over about 50 years from 1314 and the Rajaniti-ratnākara was probably his last work composed at a very advanced age. For the somewhat controversial and confused chropology of the Tirhut kings of the Kārņāta and Kameśvara dynasties, vide Hp. cat. (Introduction p. 31 ); Grierson in Ind. Ant, vol. 14, pp. 182–196 and Ind. Ant. vol. 28, p. 57; JASB 1915 pp. 407-433 (M. M. Chakravarti); JBORS vol. IX, p. 300 and X, p. 37 (Jayasval). 
Candeśvara exercised very great influence over Maithila and Bengal writers. Misarumiśra, Vardhamana, Vācaspati-miśra and Raghunandanal162 very frequently quote him. The Viramitrodaya (p. 181 ) calls the Ratnākara 'Paurastya-nibandha' (eastern digest ). 
92. Harinātha 
Harinātha is the author of a digest called Smstisära on several topics of dharmaśāstra. No part of this work has been yet printed. In the India Office there are two mss. of the Smstisära (1. O. Cat. p. 448, No, 1488 and p. 449, No. 1489). The first cites 67 authorities ( pramăpakah) on Dharmaśāstra, out of which the Karmapradipa, the Kalpataru, the Kamadhenu, Kumāra, Gapeśvaramiśra, Vijñāneśvara, Vilamba (?), Smstimañjūså and Haribara deserve special mention. This ms. contains the portion of the Smstisāra on the samskāras, rites on death, sraddha and

prayascitta. The other ms. deals with the principal topics of vivada ( various titles of law) and vyavahāra (judicial procedure), viz. partition, father's share on partition, larger share to the eldest son, persons excluded from partition and inheritance, impartible property; stridhana; the several kinds of sons; succession to the property of the sonless; re-union; gambling and prize-fighting and other titles of law; various methods of danda (punishment); the various units of measure etc.; judicial procedure i. e. the plaint, the reply, the means of proof, viz. documents, witnesses, posses sion, reasoning, oaths and ordeals; review of judgment; minority and dependence; rules about succession according to various authors. This last portion appears to be a sort of supplement, wherein the views of Balarüpa, Pārijāta, Halāyudha, Kalpataru and of the Smstisăra itself on the order of succession to a man dying sonless are set forth. Visvarūpa and Srikara are named in the summary of Bălarūpa's views and the Prakāśa at a later stage (folio 148 b). Bhavadeva-nibandha is also expressly named on possession. 
No information is given in the mss. about Harinatha himself. He is styled in the colophons 'mahamahopadhyāya.' In several places he refers to the views of the Gaudas on ācāra; e. g. he cites the view of the Gaudas that on a fasting day or sraddha day one should not employ the twig used in dantadhavana and that when there is Ekādasi on two days a house-holder should observe a fast on the first and a yati on the second. It appears that he was not a Gauda but rather a Maithil 1. 
The India Office ms. of the vivāda portion of the Smộtisāra is dated sarnyat 1614 (i. e. 1558 A. D.). Another ms. of the same portion (vide Mitra's Notices, vol. V, p. 232, No. 1913 ) was copied in Laksmana samvat 363 i. e. 1469-1470 A. D. Šūlapāni quotes the Smstisāra in his Durgotsavaviveka. Misarumiśra in his Vivadacandra several times refers to the opinions of the Smrtisāra.1163 Hence it follows that the Smrtisára was composed

before the last quarter of the 14th century. Candesvara in bis voluminous work nowhere refers to Harinåtha nor does the latter refer to him. Hence they were probably contemporaries or not separated by any appreciable interval of time. As Harinātba mentions the Kalpataru and Harihara, he must be later than about 1250 A. D. If Ganesvaramiśra116+ mentioned by Harinàtha be the author of the Sugatisopāna (which is extremely probable) who was an uncle of Candeśvara, then Harinātha cannot be earlier than about 1300 A, D. Harinātha is mentioned in the Danda viveka p. 251 and on p. 326 and the latter refers to the author of Smstisära on pp. 141, 197, 282, 284. Raghunandana in Smộti tattva, (vol. I) Tithi p. 85, criticizes the meaning of Väruna given by Harinātha ; Prayaścitta p. 536 (mentioned as Harinătho pådhyàya ); Vol. II. Ekādasi pp. 7, 105, Udvaha p. 108, Suddhi tattva 240 (as against Bhavadevabhatta ). The Smstisāra is several times mentioned as an authority in the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara (Benares S. Series on pp. 14, 48, 50 ), who is fre quently mentioned by Raghunandana in the Smstitattva ( vol. I.) Tithi pp. 136, 137, 186, Sraddba p. 226, Prayascitta p. 542. The Smstisára is mentioned by the Vivādacintàmanil165 by Vācaspati mjíra (on p. 36 of the edtion of 1837). Therefore Harinātha flourished sometime between 1300-1400 A. D. 
There are several works styled Smộtisāra e. g. of Keśava Śarmā ( Mitra's Notices, vol. II. p. 76 ), of Yadavabhūşana-bhattà cārya ( Mitra's Notices, vol. IV p. 213 No. 1642 ), of Devayājñika (D. C. Ms. No. 266 of 1884-87 and 344 of 1886-92, the latter being called Smộtisārasa ngraha). Hence it often becomes difficult to say in the case of later works, what particular Smstisāra is being quoted.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
93. Madhavācārya 
A vast mass of literature has accumulated on the history of Sayana, Madhava, Vidyaranya, the foundation of Vijayanagara, the relations of these three with the founding of the city of Vijayanagara and their relations with the kings of Vijayanagara, the identity of Madhava and Vidyāranya and so on. It is not possible to discuss the whole mass of evidence. Attention will have to be fixed in this work mainly on the contributions of Madhavācārya to Dharmasastra. 
It must be stated that sectarian zeal, local patriotisms, person al inclinations and prejudices appear to have played havoc with the Mss, of the works of Sāyana and Madhava and inscriptions and copperplates relating to them. An instance may be cited to illustrate this. There are only six introductory verses in the bhâsya on the Rgveda. Attempts appear to have been made to tamper with verses 3 and 4 ( as shown in the note).1166 As to serious disputes between persons belonging to different religions persua sions, reference may be made to the petition made by Jains that the bhaktas (Vaişpavas) were killing them (Vide Prof. B. R. Sala tore's Vol. I. p. 103).

Vide the review of Vijayanagara-Origin of the City and the Empire' by Dr. N. Venkataramanayya in J, A. H. R. S. Vol. IX. pp. 49-54 ( by K.

(1) Hoysala origin propounded by messrs Krishna Swaini Aiyyangar and Krishna Shastri; (2) the Canarese sources advocated by Father Heras and Mr. Hayavadana kao and (3) the Andhra origin spon sored by Vincent Smith and Dr. Venkataramaniah.

It will be seen that some Mss, used by the editors of the Poona Vaidika Sariisodhana Manlala read in verse 3 सायणाचार्य for माधवाचार्य and in verse four सायणाचार्यों for माधवाचार्यों and four mss. read two more verses after verse 3 as follows — H E TEET सायणार्यों ममानुजः । सर्व वेत्त्येष वेदानां व्याख्यातृत्वेन मुज्यताम् ।। इत्युक्तो माध argu arengtufa: (strautica i v. l.

93. Madhavācārya 
779 
Madhavācārya is the brightest star in the galaxy of daksinatya authors on dharmaśāstra. His fame stands only second to that of the great Sankarācārya. He had a most versatile genius and either himself wrote or inspired his brother Sāyaṇa and others to write voluminous works on almost all branches of Sanskrit literature, As an erudite scholar, as a far-sighted statesman, as the bulwark of the Vijayanagara kingdom in the first days of its foundation, as a saṁnyasin given to peaceful contemplation and renunciation in old age, he led such a varied and useful life that even to this day his is a name to conjure with. Among his numerous works two deserve special mention here, viz., the Parāśara-madhaviya his commentary on the Parāśarasmộti and the Kālanirnaya. 
The Parāśara-madhaviya has been published several times, the edition in the B. I. Series and in the Bombay Sanskrit Series being the best known. In the following the Bombay edition has been used. This work is very extensive and occupies about 2300 print ed pages in the Bombay edition. It is not a mere commentary on Parāsara's text, but is in the nature of a digest of civil and religious law. The original smrti of Parāsara contains no verses on vyavahāra but Mädliavācārya hangs on the slender peg of a single verse of Parāśaral167 calling upon the king to rule bis subjects with righteous ness, has treatise on vyavahāra that covers a little over a fourth part of the whole commentary (vide note 491 above on Parāśara). The Parāśara-madhaviya is a work of authority on modern Hindu Law in southern India. 1108 His style is lucid and he generally avoids lengthy and abstruse discussions. Besides numerous smrti kāras and puràņas he names the following authors and works--- Aparārka, Devasvāmin, Purāṇasara, Prapañcasāra, Medhātithi, Vivarapakāra (on the Vedāntasutra ), Višvarūpācārya, Sambhu, Śivasvamin, Smộticandrika. The Paràsara-madhaviya was amongst his earliest works. He tells us that there was no commentary on Paràsara before him.1169 Raghunandana in Abnikatattva (vol.

The Kàlanirņaya of Madhavācārya has been published several times. In the following the B. I. edition has been used. He states that he wrote this work after he composed his commen tary on the Parāsarasmsti. 1170 The work is divided into five prakaranas. The first (Upodghāta ) deals with a scholastic dis quisition on käla (time) and its real nature; the 2nd (called vatsara ) speaks of the year, its various lengths according as it is candra, sāvana or saura, of the two ayanas, of the seasons and their number, of the months (candra, saura, sāvana and nāksatra) of the intercalary months, and the religious acts allowed and for bidden in intercalary months, of the two paksas (fortnights ); the third prakarana (pratipat-prakarana ) deals with the meaning of the word tithi, duration of a tithi, the fifteen tithis of a pakşa, two kinds of tithis, viz. suddhå (i. e. not intermixed with another tithi on the same day) and viddha (intermixed with another tithi on the same day), rules about the preference of the first tithi for parti cular religious rites and observances (for Gods and Manes ) when intermixed with the preceding and following tithis, the fifteen muhurtas of the day and of the night; the fourth ( dvitiyādi tithi--prakaraṇa ) extends the application of the rules about pratipad to the tithis from the second to the fifteenth and decides on what tithi ( whether inermixed with the preceding or the following ) certain vratas, such as Gaurivrata on the third, Janmāstami on the 8th, were to be performed; the fifth (prakimaka i. e. miscellaneous ) deals with rules about the deter mination of nakşatras for various acts, the yogas and karanas and rules about samkrānti and eclipses and the actions proper for them. 
The Kālanirpaya besides the names of numesous sages, purânas, astronomical and astrological writers mentions the following works and authors :-Kālàdarśa (p. 83), Bhoja (as having composed in Aryā metre a work on the Saiva agama), Muhůtra-vidhana-sāra (p. 341 ). Vateśvarasiddhanta, Vāsiştha

Rāmāyaṇa, the Siddhanta-siromani ( of Bhāskarācārya ), Hemădri (P. 67 his vratakhanda and Danakhanda ). 
The vesres (Karikās ) in the Kålanirnaya are collected together and sometimes treated as a separate work. Vide Prof. Velankar's Cat. of the Sanskrit Mss. in the B. B. R. A. S. (pub. in 1925 ) No. 676 and also his Cat. of the Desai collection of Sanskrit Mss. Nos. 197-199 (pub. in 1953 ). 
The Kalanirnaya was published by the A. S. B. (Calcutta ) in 1889, also in the Kashi Sanskrit Series of Benares in 1936 and was also published with the commentary of Laksmidevi Payagunde. 
It should not be supposed that Sayana single-handed com posed the Vedabhāsyas. He was probably the chairman of the com mittee of scholars gathered for carrying out the work of the several bhâsyas. From the cnlophons of his several works it appears that he was minister under four kings, viz Bukka I, Kampana, Sargama II and Harihara II, The Mysore Archaeological Report for 1908 para 54 states (under date 1386 A. D.) that Harihara II gave in the presence of Vidyāraṇya a copperplate grant to three scholars who were the promoters (prarartaka) in the matter of the commentaries on the four Vedas, their names being Nārāyaṇa Vājapeyayājin, Narahari Somayājin and Paņdari Dikşita. Father Heras admits that he himself referred to Vidyāranya as the great helper of Harihara in the foundation of Vijayanagara, but later he grew wiser and says that it was his mistake (vide 'Beginnings' &c. p. 14). 
Even Father Heras concedes that the stone inscription in E. C. VI Sgi of 1346 A. D. is genuine. It records a grant, after obeisance to Vidyātirtha, by Harihara of nine villages to Bharatitirtha Sripida, his disciples and others and 40 brāhmaṇas residing in that tirtha of Sringeri. Father Heras ( on pp. 19-28 of his work ) gives a catalogue of 196 inscriptions from 1336 A. D. to 1669 A D. Father Heras summarises on p. 18 of his work the principal, historical events in the life of Vidyaranya con nected with Vijayanagara In 1347 Vidyaranya was a minister of Mārapa in the kingdom of Banavåsi – twelve thousand; in 1356 he was at Benares, but had to return to Vijayanagara as he was ordered to do so by his guru Vidyātirtha; in 1368 he was a great minister (Mahāpradhana) of Bukka 1; in 1380 he is

History of Dharmaśāstra 
mentioned as Jagadguru; his teachings benefitted Harihara II in 
1384; in 1386 he died at Hampi and an inscription of Harihara II contains a funeral eulogy of the learned Guru. Heras insists that he was not Jagad-guru in 1346 or 1356. He further holds that Vijayanagara was purposely corrupted into Vidyānagara; only 54 out of 196 Inscriptions exhibit this form of Vidyanagara; while 111 all give the name Vijayanagara and only 31 refer to the ancient name of the city. Father Heras rounds off the examination of the several inscriptions and grants with the following conclusion (p. 34 of. Beginning &c.'): 'Hence it may be concluded that the ascetics of the Sringerimath fabricated the story of Vidyāraṇya as the founder of the city and Empire of Vijayanagara in the beginning of the 16th century. And it seems most probable that the fabrication of the whole story and the falsification of a great number, if not of all the spurious grants above referred to, was perpetrated during the rule of Ramchandra Bharati who directed the Sringeri Matra from 1508 to 1560". This is not the place to enter upon an examination of Father Heras' reasons for this conclusion. But I cannot avoid the temptation of quoting one of the reasons set forth by Heras as it is well worth quoting. It is : 'Finally such religious ascetics and recluses psychologically are persons often inclined to fabricate such fables'. Then he winds up with the remark 'Hence that fabrication of a story which one may derive a profit from - provided no harm should result from the concoction to a third person - is always attractive to such religious recluses'. This is a grand generalisation of Father Heras. He adduces no evidence except his ipse dixit; comment is superfluous. I hope that Heras would have agreed to apply that dictum to the priests of all religions, as an English poet says the priests of all religions are the same'. 
In this History of Dharmaśāstra the discussion of the vexed question of the connection of Madhava-Vidyåranya with the foun ding of Vijayanagara is not necessary or relevant. The only important question for the History is the identity of Madhava and Vidyāranya. That Vidyaranya presided over the Sringeri Matha is admitted even by Father Heras. That Madhava became a Sannyasin and became known as Vidyāraṇya is a tradition of long standing. There is some literary evidence also to substantiate this. 
93. Madharacàrya 
783 
Vidyàranya is the author of several works such as the Jivanmukti viveka and the Pañcadasī. The former of these two has several Introductory verses, one of which ( verse 9 ) 1171 says that some sannyasins are called “Kuticaka' or Bahüdaka'; they are * tridandios', but the paramahamsa' is different and that the first two have been dealt with by us (me) in the commentary on Parăsara-smsti, while the Paramahamsa would be expatiated upon in this work (i. e. Jivanmukti-viveka ). 
Other questions are: (1) Who founded Vijayanagara and (2) whether Madhava is identical with Vidyaranya. From the days of Sewell, who wrote the hook Forgotten Empire' on Vijayanagara Empire, many works and papers on the subject of the founder or founders of Vijayanagara have appeared. Vide, the example, " The origin of the city of Vijayanagara and Empire' by Dr. N. Venkata Ramanayya (University of Madras 1933 ), Dr. B. R. Salatore on Rajguru of the founders of Vijayanagara and the Pontiffs of Sringeri Matha' in J. A. H. R, vol. IX part 4 pp. 33-42 and his two volumes on Social and Political Life in the Vijayanagara Empire' (1934, in obout 1000 pages); Journal of Mythic Society, vol. 27 pp. 54-107 ( foundation of Vijayanagara ); * Founders of Vijayanagara' by S. Srikantayya (1938); Mr. Gopinath Rao in £. I. vol. XV pp. 10–15. Mr. Srikantayya observ es on p. 43 Who founded Vijayanagara? The question still remains unanswered .. 
On the question of the identity of Madhava and Vidyāranya a few references are given here. In I. H. Q. vol. VI pp. 701 717 and vol. VII p. 78 ff. Mr. R. Ramrao tries to negative the identity. In I. H. Q. vol. VIII pp. 611-644 K. Markandeya Sastri replies at length to R. Ramrao. R. Rarmrao returns to the charge in I, H. Q. vol. X pp. 801-810; Journal of Indian History vol. XII pp. 241-250 ( Doraiswamy Iyengar rejects the identity of Madhava and Vidyaranya ). The present author holds that Madhava and Vidyāraṇya are identical.

History of Dharmasastra 
There are, apart from traditions and chronicles several inscriptions that bear on the connection of Mădbavācārya or Vidyaranya with the several kings of Vijayanagara. Father Heras in his work called · Beginnings of Vijyanagar History' goes so far as to say that practically all inscriptions relating to the Vidya ranya tradition or to the connection of Vidyāraṇya with Harihara and Bukka in political and imperial undertakings are spurious or must be certainly looked upon with suspicion. His remarks are very sweeping and cannot be accepted as embodying the truth. At least about 200 inscriptions and grants relating to Vijayanagara are known. The scholars must try to separate the spurious ones from the others. There is no reason to damn all grants and Inscrip tions referring to Vidyaranya. He was a Sannyasin and had renounced the world. It is too much to suppose that he forged grants. If one holds that he did so, then the question arises, for what benefit or for whose benefit? Besides copperplate grants can be easily fabricated and passed off; but Incriptions on stone are generally in public places such as roads, temples, tops of hills, where all members of the public can observe them everyday. A scholar must think long before damning an inscription on stone as a forgery. 
There is no doubt that in the 13th century A. D. and after wards Hindu society in South India was ridden with the wrangles and quarrels of the followers of Sankarācārya, Mādhavācārya, Råmānujācārya and of Lingayats and Jains and that individuals of some persuasions tampered with mss. to bolster up their indivi dual preferences, leanings and beliefs. This may be illustrated by citing the Introduction of Sāyaṇācārya's bhāsya as done above. 
Sāyaṇācārya's bhāsyallia on the Yajurveda-samhità is once mentioned by Raghunandana (vol. I, Sraddha p. 277 as quoted below). But Madhavácārya is frequently quoted by him. For example, the Kalamadhaviva is quoted very often as on ( vol. I) Tithi pp. 1, 6, 8, 16, 33, 48, 69 as Kalamadhaviya or Madhava carya, Śrāddha p. 283; the Parásarabhāsya of Mādhavācārya is mentioned in (vol. I) Ahnika on pp. 336, 382 and simply as

Madhavācārya also in many places e. g. ( vol. I ), 'Mala pp. 771, 781, 794 (definition of the word Mantra ). 
A good deal about the family and personal history of Màdhavācārya can be gleaned from the above mentioned two works and other treatises of Madhavācārya. From the Parāśara madhaviya we1173 learn that he was the son of Māyaṇa and Srimati, that Sayana and Bhoganātha1174 were his younger brothers, that he was a student of the black Yajurveda and of the Baudhāyana-sútra-carana and belonged to the Bhàradvāja gotra. The introductory verses and the colophon of the Prayascitta-sudhānidhi 175 of Sayana corroborate most of these particulars. A verse at the beginning of the Kālanirnaya tells us that Vidyātirtha, Bharatitirtha and “rikantha were his

To translate the word 'Narmasaciva' as simply "jester' is not quite accurate (as the editor of the Inscription does ) The idea is : the very learned brothers Sāyaṇa and Madhava (both ministers) were far above play! fulness or the cracking of jokes with the king, but Bhoganatha a poet, being young and less learned than the other two, could, be intimate with the king. The verse quoted in I.

teachers.1176 ' The Parasara-Madhaviya highly eulogisesium Màdhava, compares him to divine and semi-divine councillors like Ångirasa of Indra and says that he was the hereditary teacher (kulaguru) and mantrin of king Bukkana, (or Bukka). The colophons to the several works of Sảyaņa, the younger brother of Madhavācārya, show that these brothers were closely connected with four rulers of the Vijayanagar dynasty, viz. Bukka and his son Harihara, Kampa and his son Sangama. In the Yajnatantra-sudhānidhill18 (ms. in the Bhau Daji collec tion ) Sayana, the author of the bhāsyas on the Vedas, is said to be the kulaguru of Harihara, son of Sangama. In the Guruvamsa-kāvya ( Vanivilāsa Press ed.) it is said that Vidya ranya was the pupil of Vidyātirtha, that he composed Veda bhâsyas and published them in the names of Sāyana and Mādhava, that Harihara and Bukka were the most valiant of the five sons of Sangama (v. 48 ), that Vira Rudra was the sovereign of Harihara and Bukka and was defeated by the sura trana i. e. sultan. The same work says that Vidyaranya founded Vijayanagari in sake 1258, Vaisakha suddha 7 Sunday (i. e. 30th April 1335 A. D.) and crowned Harihara king.11180 
Burnell in his introduction to the Vamsabrāhmaṇa started the theory that Sāyaṇa and Madhava were identical and put forward an esoteric meaning on the verse that states that Sayapa and Bhoganātha were the younger brothers of Madhava. But the facts as culled from the works of these two great men and the inscrip tions of contemporary Vijayanagara kings are too strong for the

hypothesis of Burnell and make it took absurd. The whole subject about the relationship of Madliava, Sāyaṇa and Bhoga nàtha bas been carefully examined by Rao Bahadur R. Narsimba char in Ind. Ant. vol. 45 pp. 1-6 and 17ff, and the theory of Burnell has been thoroughly refuted. Sāyaṇa and Bhoganatha were as real personages as Madhavācārya himself. Madhavācārya in his later years became a sarinyāsin and was named Vidyāranya. To the items of evidence adduced by R. B. R. Narasimhachar for establishing the identity of Madhava and Vidyaranya (Ind. Ant. vol. 45 p. 18) I may add one more. The Viramitrodaya ascribes the commentary on Paràsara composed by Madhava to Vidya ranya.1179 It has however to be noted that the Guruvamśakāvya (Vàņivilās Press ed.) says (V. 41-44) that Vidyāranya was diffe rent from both Sayaņa and Madhava. 
Sāyaṇa1180 was not only a very learned man and author of several works (besides the Vedabhāsyas ) but he also fought several battles. He composed several works enumerated in the note below.1181 
In the bhāsya on Parásara he names three gurus, Vidya tirtba, Bhāratitirtha and Srikantha. He, however, says in his Anubhūtiprakasa that Vidyatirtha was his principal guru. 1132 
Vidyaranya was originally Madhava. He is the author of the Jivanmuktiviveka and of Pancadasi. The introductory verses 9-11 of the Jivanmuktiviveka have been cited above. The com

mentary on Parāśarasmộti (called Parāsaramadhaviya) is claimed to be his by Madhavācārya (vide note 1170). Therefore Vidyà ranya's words lead to the conclusion that he is identical with Madhavācārya in a former stage of life (àśrama). Vide Rao Bahadur R. Narasimhachar's learned paper on “Madhavācārya and his younger brothers' in I. A. vol. 45 pp. 1-6 and 17-24. 
Among the works of Madhavācàrya are the following: Parāśarasmộtibbāsya, Kālamadhava, Jivanmuktiviveka, Pañcadasi, Jaiminiya-nyayamàlāvistara, Vaiyasika-nyāyamálāvistara. The Pañcadasi has a commentary of Ramakrsna (Nir. Press ed. of 1918). It is a famous work on the Advaita Vedānta. It is so called because it has 15 Prakaraņas. It may also be noted that in the Nir. edition the work has 1501 verses. The longest Praka raņas are Trptidipa with 298 verses and Citradipa with 290. The shortest Prakaraṇa is ‘Mahāvākya-viveka ' with only eight verses. The Jivanmuktiviveka has extensive quotations from the Upa nişads and the Bhagavadgitā. It also quotes the following works and authors viz. Anandabodhācārya (p. 8), Aryāpañcāsiti (p. 48), Upadeśasābasri (p. 6), Gaudapādācārya (pp. 78, 108), Daksa p. 106 (two verses of which one is Daksasmộti VII. 30), Patañjali (p. 39), Bhāgavata (p. 87), Manusmộti (pp. 106 and 108 quote respectively VII, 10-11 and VI. 53-54), Medhātithi ( 9 verses on p. 109 about Yati, probably from his Smstiviveka not yet discovered ), Yama (p. 108 ), Yogabhāsya (pp. 64, 74), Yogasutra (pp. 46, 67), Vākyavịtti (p. 30 two verses ), Vedanta sūtra (p. 30, IV. 1. 19). 
It appears that Madhavācārya regarded Vidyātirtha, his principal guru, as an incarnation of God Mahesvara. Vide the verse quoted in the note below, 1183 
Besides being a mantrin of the Vijayanagara kings, it appears that Madhavācărya performed some great vedic sacri fices, and made donations called “Mahādānas'. In the

Yajñatantrasudhānidhi 18+ he is described by Sāyaṇa as 'Mabă kratūnām-ahartă' and to have weighed himself against precious metals ( tulāpuruşadāna ). 
The chronology of the kings of Vijayanagara has been a fruitful source of controversy. It is not necessary to go into that chronology in great detail here. It may be studied in such works as Sewell's ‘Forgotten Empire' and in E. I. vol. III. p. 36, E. I. vol. XIV p. 68, E. I. vol. XV p. 8. The following pedigree1185 will be sufficient for the purpose of connecting Mādhava and his brothers with the kings of Vijayanagara. The earliest inscription is that of Harihara I dated sake 1261 (1339-40 A. D.) wherein Harihara is said to be a Mahā mandalesvara and is spoken of as 'Sri-Vira-Hariyappa Vodeya ’.1186 The colophon of the Mādaviyā Dhātuvștti describes Mādhava as the great minister of Sangamaràja, the son of Kamparāja.1187 The Bitragunța grant in šake 1278 (1356 A. D.) by Sangama II at the request of his teacher Srikanthanatha shows that Bhoganātha1138 who composed the contents of the grant was a narmasaciva (gay or humorous companion ) of Sangama II. We saw above that Srikantha was a teacher of Madhavācārya and that Bhoganātha was the youngest brother of Màdbavācārya. Bhoganātha in order to be a poet and a narama

History of Dharmaśāstra 
saciva of a reigning sovereign must have been a grown-up man in 1356 A. D. and so Mădhavácārya must have been quite an elderly person about that time. The Kälanirņaya tells us that in the cyclic year Isvara following immediately after sake 1258 śrāvana was an intercalary month and that in the cyclic year Bhāva that preceded sake 1258 (i. e. sake 1256) Phålguna was an intercalary month and then examines the intercalary months that occurred in the cyclic years up to Vikāri thereafter (i. e. up to šake 1281 ).11384 As the Kålanirņaya examines the intercalary months from śake 1256 (i. e. 1334 A, D.) to śake 1281 (i. e. 1359 A. D.), it follows that it was either composed during these years or immediately after this period. The Parāśara madhaviya was composed before the Kālanirnaya. Rao Bahadur Narsimhachar states that in a copperplate grant dated 1386 A. D. it is said that Haribara (11) gave in the presence of Vidya ranya-sripada certain donations to three scholars who were the promoters (pravartaka) of the commentaries on the four Vedas ( Ind. Ant. vol. 45 p. 19). Another inscription speaks of Vidya ranya in 1378 A. D.1188 This shows that Madhavācārya had become a sasnyasin at least in 1377 A. D. Tradition says that Vidyāraṇya died in 1386 A, D, at the ripe old age of 90. There fore we shall not be far wrong if we place the literary activity of Mādhava-Vidyāraṇya between 1330-1385 A. D. From the remarks about intercalary months it appears that the Parāśara mādhaviya and Kālanirnaya were composed between 1335-1360 A. D. There was a tradition among pandits that it was Madhava cārya who composed bhāşyas on the Vedas and ascribed them to his brother Sảyana. Kasinătha, in his Vitthala-șómantra sāra-bhäsya says so. 1190

Great confusion has been caused by identifying Madhava Vidyāraṇya with another scholar named Madhava who was also a mantrin of Bukka, who was a great warrior and was governor of Banavase and the country round Goa on the western coast. In a grant 101 of the village Kucara, also called Madhavapura, dated śake 1313 ( 1391 A. D.), it is said that he routed the armies of the Turuşkas, wrested Goa the capital of Konkaņa from them and re-established the temple of Saptanātha (i. e. Sapta-kotiśvara ). There is another inscription dated sake 1290 (i. e. 1368 A. D.) where the great minister ( Mahāpradhāna) Madhavāñka is stated to have ruled over Banavase 12000 under king Bukkaråya ( Ind. Ant. vol. IV, p. 206 ). Fleet is wrong in identifying the minister Madhavanka with Madhavācārya-Vidyāraṇya. Another grant from Goa (found by Dr. Bhau Daji) says that Madhava-mantrin, son of Caundibhatta, established the flingu of Saptanātha (JBBRAS Vol. 9, p. 228 ). Vide E. C. vol. VIII, Sorab No. 375 dated sake 1268 ( Sunday Madhava 30, i. e. llth Feb. 1347), where we are told that Madhavamantrin was governor of Candragutti, capital of Bunavase 12000, that he was minister of Marapa, younger brother of Harihara I and that he was a disciple of Kriyāsakti, a Saiva teacher. In E. C. vol. VII, Shikarpur 281 dated sake 1290 Kartika bahula 8 (i. e. 15th November 1368 ) Madhava is said to have been a son of the Cāuṇda of the Angirasa gotra and a minister of Bukka I and his guru is said to have been Käsivilāsa Kriyāsakti. 
From this it follows that the Madhava mantrin who was a governor of Banavase and Goa and was living in 1391 A. D. was the son of Caundibhatta and cannot be identified with Madhavācārya who was the son of Māyana. 
There is a ms, in the Bombay University Library of a work called Kälanirnayakärika in 130 verses, which contains the intro ductory verses of the Kālanirņaya dealing with the contents, though in a somewhat different order. There are several commen taries on the Kālanirnaya, viz. Kalanirnayadipika by Ramacandra cārya composed about 1450 A. D., a commentary called Lakşmi

94 Madanapala and Viśyeśvarabhatta 
The Madanapārijāta compiled under the patronage of king Madanapala by Viśvesvarabhatta is a famous work. Like Bhoja, Madanapala seems to have been a great patron of learning and several works are attributed to him. At least four works on dharmaśāstra are ascribed to him (i. e. were written under his patronage ) viz. the Madanapärijäta, Smộtimahārnva or Madana mahărņava, Tithinirnayasāra and Smộtikaumudi. Four more works are ascribed to Madanapala that deal with subjects other than those of Dhasmasastra viz. Madanavinodanighantu, Surya siddhāntaviveka, Siddhantagarbha and Yantraprakāśa. 
The Madanaparijata is an extensive work in 995 pages pub lished in the B. I. Series (in 1893). There are 23 introductory verses, the first 13 of which give the genealogy of Madanapala. In the printed edition these 13 verses are stated to have been added by Purohita Sri-Rāmadeva. The last of the introductory verses states that the work was composed after a careful study of Hemādri, Kalpavěksa (i, e. Kalpataru ), Aparārka, Sinộticandrikā, Smộtyarthasāra and Mitākṣarā. ! 12 That Madanapala was only the patron and not the real author of the work is made clear in several places. In the introductory verse 20 it is stated that the work was compiled through (lit. by the mouth of) learned men.1193 In several places in the body of the work 194 it is said that the author has explained the matter under discussion in his work called Subodhini, a commentary on the Mitāksarà. Therefore the Madanapărijāta was really composed by Viśveśvara bhatta, the author of the Subodhinī. The Madanapărijata con tains nine stabakas ( bunches i. e. chapters) on brahmacarya, the

dharmas of householders, the daily duties (āhnika-krtya ), the saskaras from garbhadhäna onwards; impurity on birth and death, the purification of various substances (dravyasuddhi), śräddha, dāyabhaga ( partition and inheritance ) and prāyaścitta. The long est section is the 9th on · Prāyascittas and Karmaphala' (pp. 304 ), then comes the 7th section on 'śrāddha '(pp. 172 ), the 3rd section on ' Āhnika' covers pp. 142 and first on 'brahmacarya' is dealt with in 128 pages. The shortest is the 5th on asauca' (in 28 pages); the 4th on samskäras also is a short one (only 33 pages). In the portion on the Dāyabhäga it very closely follows the Mitakşará. 
The Madanapărijāta (after quoting a verse of Vişnu ) on p. 654 propounds the somewhat startling proposition that even the Kānina and other secondary sons (mentioned by Yāj. II. 128-132 ) succeed as heirs to a man's property ( vide note below ) 1195 and relies on Yüj. (II. 128-132), who enumerates twelve kinds of sons from aurasa to apaviddha and remarks that each of these succeeds to the father's property in the absence of any of the sons enumerated before him in the text. Kanina is a son born to a man from an unmarried girl. Hence a Kānina son would have succeeded before the paunarbhara and other sons named by Yāj. after him. The Manusmộti (IX. 172 ) also refers to the kanina son. Vijñāneśvara ( in Mit. on Yāj. II. 132 ) contains the very words quoted in the passage as his opinion. 
Vide also pp. 385, 603, 774 of the Madanapārijāta for references to Subodhini. It may, however, be noted that the Subodhini on the Vyavahāra section (p. 61 of Gharpure's ed.) states that all this about Känina and similar sons refers to other ages ( yugas ) and that in the Kali age only two kinds of sons (viz. aurasa and dattaka) are recognised. The style of the Madanapărijāta is simple. Its style is simple and lucid. Besides

There is a work called Mahārnava ascribed to Måndhătă, a son of Madanapāla. In several mss. of this work deposited in the Deccan 197 College there are introductory verses giving the genea logy of Madanapāla that agree almost word for word with the introductory verses of the Madanapărijāta. Moreover two verses that speak of Visvešvarabhatta occur here also as well as in the Madanapārijāta and Subodhini. The Madanamahārņava was edited by Pandit Embara Krishnamacarya and Mr. M. R. Nambiyar and was published in 1953 in the Gaekwad Oriental Series. It is a large work in 468 printed pages with an intro duction (pp. 11-26 ) and a Sanskrit Index (pp. 27-40) of the

Hundreds of verses from Mapu and Yāj. are quoted by the Madanapārijāta. Besides, several smrtıkāras, smrtis and other authors are named and quoted ; viz. Aparārka (p. 528 ), Acārasāgara ( 58 ), Kalpataru ( 553, 597, 697 ), Gängeya ( 96, twice), Guru (i, e. Prabhākara 89), Govindarāja ( 553-4), Caturvimsatimata (638, 754, 834, 882); Camatkārakhanda (310 a verse), Cintāmaņi ( 607 on Śrāddha ), Dharmavętti (or-vivrti, 753, 772), Nārāyaṇa ( 69, 71, 72, 565, all verses), Bādarāyana ( 3 verses on pp. 186-187 on the Dvirăgamana muburta of a newly married girl, two of which are in Sārdūla vikridita metre), Bhavadeva ( 89 on Vākyabheda ), Mandana miśra ( 183, 185, two verses on gaurakāla and gaunamukhya. kāla), Yajñapārsva ( 161, two verses on bride having menses at or about the time of marriage ceremony), Ratnávali (607), Vijñāneśvara (536), Śivasvänin (619), Vişņusamuccaya ( 291 ) Sat-trimşanmata ( 421 and on nine other pages ), Sure. śvara ( 186, two verses on dvirāgamana), Smộticandrikā ( 528, 536 ), Smrtimañjari ( of Govindarāja 534 ), Smrtimabā rnava ( 93 ), Hemădri ( 536 ).

contents of the 40 chapters. One Ms. directly claims the work as Visvesvarabhatta's while the others say that the work was com piled by Māndhātà, a son of king Madanapala, through learned men. It begins by quoting in the second chapter thirty verses of the first chapter of the sätàtapiya-Karmavipaka contained in Jivananda's Dharmaśāstra-sangraha ( latter part pp. 435-455, in all about 187 verses in six chapters ). The Anandaśrama collec tion of Smộtis has a sätātapa-smsti in six chapters but it contains about one hundred verses more than in Jivananda's text, as it adds in each chapter several verses. Karmavipaka means (literally ) the fruition of one's evil actions. The central theory of Sātātapa is that those guilty of greater or lesser sins who do not undergo the appropriate prāyaścittas (penances ) fall into hell for a time, are born again with certain signs (or defects) on their bodies, and that if they repent and undergo the prescribed penances, then those tell-tale signs disappear and that sins of former lives affect men by diseases, which disappear by japa (repetition of sacred text inaudibly) or by worship of deities or homas ( offerings in fire ) and by appropriate gifts. Thirteen diseases and physical affections such as leprosy, consumption, loss of sight are caused by what are called mahāpātakas; dropsy and other diseases are the outcome of upapătakas. Appropriate penances (prāyaścittas ) remove the effects; so also do gifts of a cow (with calf) or a bull or gifts of ten nivartanas of land, dinners to brāhmaṇas, japa of mantras to Rudra &c. Sătătapa explains the well-known terms Rudra, Mahārudra and Atirudra and his words are followed by the Madanamahārņava (vide note below ).1198 
In several other places also the Mahārņava quotes passages from Sátātapa-Samhità. For example, on p. 436 it quotes two

The word Karmavipaka occurs in Yaj. III. 133 and in Anusâsana-parva ( 144. 43 Ch. ed.) and Yogasútra II. 17 ( sati müle tadvipāko jātyāyurbhogah) i, e. sinners are born as different animals or worms etc. ( Manu XII. 55-60 and Yaj. III. 207-216), they have a long or short life and fierce sufferings in hells (Manu IV. 88-90 and XII. 75, Yaj. III. 206 ). Vide for this doctrine H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 172-176. Vas. 20.44 and Sankha quoted in Mit. on Yāj. III. 216 hold that the murderer of a brāhmaṇa is afflicted with leprosy (brahmahà-kușthi). Long before the Mahārņava several extensive works on Karmavipāka must have been com posed, since the Mahārnava cites the work Karmavipäkasangraha 51 times, the Karmavipäkasamuccaya 48 times, and the Karma vipäkasāra 21 times. Vide Smrtitattva, vol. I, Malamāsa p. 835 for a long quotation from Sātātapiya-karmavipaka. 
Dharma1200 had a fivefold aspect viz. varna-dharma, asrama Jharma, varpåśrama-dharma (e. g. a brāhmapa-brahmacārin has to observe the rules peculiar to his varna as well as rules applicable to the stage of studenthood ), gunadharma (a king has certain duties peculiar to his position, viz. protection of subjects, dis pensing justice &c.) and Naimittikadharma (prayascittas i, e. penances). This work also is said to have been compiled by

Šātātapa is one of the sages enumerated in Yāj. I. 4-5 as Dharmaprayojaka. A half verse of Sātātapa is quoted by Viśvarūpa un p. 11 ( Yāj. II. 4-5), but the five other quota tions of Sātātapa by l'iśvarūpa are in prose as on III. 237 p. 94, on III, 262 p. 148. The Mit, has many verse quotations from Sātātapa. A verse of Aagiras quoted by Mit, on Yāj. III, 22 mentions the view of $ātātapa. The Mit. quotes many verses of Sātātapa and some prose passages on Yāj. III. 243, 254, 263-4. Aparırka also quotes a few prose passages of Sātătapa on Prāyaścittas ( as on pp. 1053, 1071, 1120, 1128. 1147, 1149, 1152, 1158, 1161, 1169 ).

Mândhātā through the learned.1201 It is said to have been based on a study of the śruti, the smrtis and the purānas. The work is divided into 40 tarangas (waves). The principal subject1209 of the work is to describe how the various diseases which human bodies are heir to the result of evil deeds done in past lives (this subject being called Karmavipaka in dharmaśāstra works) and to prescribe various rites and penances for the eradication of the evil results of evil deeds. Among the various rites and penances that are set forth in great detail may be mentioned the Kuşmànda-homa, Rudraikādasini, Mahārudrabhiseka, Vinayaka śānti, the Navagrahayajña &c. The Mahārņava mentions the Karmavipāka of Śātātapa, the Caturvarga-cintāmaņi (folio 234 a of D. C. Ms.No. 259 of 1886-1892), the Mitākşară, the Karmavi päkasamuccaya &c. It is worthy of note that in the Smsti-kaumudi the authorship of the Mahārnava is claimed by the author him self and is not ascribed to Madanapăla's son.1203 
The Tithinirpayasāra is another work compiled under Mada napala. Stein in his cat. of mss. at Jammu (p. 306 ) gives extracts from this work. The first fourteen verses are the same as those in the Madanapärijata.

The Smrtikaumudi 205 contains an introduction of 17 verses, 13 of which set forth the genealogy of Madanapala. The four teenth verse tells us that Madanapala composed works called Yantraprakāśa, Mahāmava, Pārijāta, Siddhāntagarbha and Tithi nirnayasăra.1206 The 15th verse says that he composes the Smsti kaumudi through the learned 1207 The 17th verse says that his predecessors have generally dilated upon the dharmas of the three higher varnas and the dharmas of the sūdra have not been dealt with by them as a principal topic, therefore he would clearly expound the dharmas of the last rarna. At the end of the ms. in the I. O. Cat. it is described as the younger sister of the Mada napärijāta and of the Mahārnava.1208 This is not found in the D. C. ms. which was copied in samvat 1615. This work is divided into four kalollăsas, each kalollasa being subdivided into kiranas (rays). The first kalollăsa has two kiraņas, the second has four, the third and fourth five kiraṇas each. The subjects dealt with are : 1. two kinds of südras, viz. : the kevalaśūdra ( simple sūdra ) and one who is of mixed descent, being born of a sūdra woman from a man of the higher castes; the mixed castes; II. general discourses on the sûdra's adhikära for engaging in various acts and performing various rites, such as the study of the vedas and smstis, the performance of garbhādhāna and other samskäras and the consecration of sacred fires; saņdhyāvandana; the südra's capacity for attaining the knowledge of brahman; III. marriage; different forms of marriage, prohibited degrees of blood relation ship ( sāpiņdya ), the various rites of marriage such as kanya dàna; such saṁskāras as năma-karaņa (naming the child ), the duties of sūdras in ordinary and difficult times; àśauca for Śūdras; the various sraddhas for them; the letting loose of a bull in honour of the dead; IV. śūdra's daily duties such as sauca, brushing the teeth, baths in the morning and at other times, brahmayajña, tarpana, vaišvadeva, daily śrāddha, dinner, &c.

The Smộtikaumudi mentions among others Aparārka, Kệtya kalpataru, Mitāksarā, Medhătithi, Yajna pārśva and Smstimañjari. It also quotes from the Vedānta-kalpatarul209 and the author claims the Madanapārijāta as his own work. 
It has been seen how all the four works set out above were composed under the patronage of Madanapāla and how they were probably from the pen of Viśvesvarabhatta. There is one more work on Dharmaśāstra which Visvesvarabhatta composed in his own name without the shelter of a patron's name. It is the Subodhini, a commentary on the Mitīksară of Vijñānesvara. The vyavahāra portion of it has been published in Bombay by Mr. S. S. Setlur and also by Mr. J. R. Gharpure. Mr. Govind Das had seen portions of the Subodhini on the prāyaścitta section also. The Subodhini does not comment on each word of the Mitāksarā but explains only important passages. It is a learned work. This was the earliest coniposition of Visvesvarabhatta, since it is men tioned even in the Madanapārijāta. The first verse of the Subo dhini is also the opening verse of the Mahārpava and of the Smộtikaumudi.1210 
From the verses1211 21 and 22 in the introduction to the Madanapārijāta it appears that Viśvesvara was the son of Pedi bhatta and Ambikā, that he was of the Kausikagotra and was the pupil of Vyāsāranya-muni. In the Subodhini also the verse' mātā &c.' occurs at the end with slight suitable variations and the

verse' matiryesām' in the beginning. The second introductory verse in Mr. Gharpure's edition makes Visvešvara the son of Appabhatta,1212 while Mr. Settur reads • Pettibhatta’ which is probably a misreading for Pedibbatta. From his father's name it appears that Visvesvara was a native of the Dravida country1213 and migrated to Northern India in search of patronage after he wrote the Subodhini. Visvešvara is regarded as one of the leading authorities of the Benares School of modern Hindu Law.1914 Madanapāla belonged to the family of Țāka kings that ruled in Kāstha (modern Kath ) op the Junna to the north of Delhi,1215 The printed Madanapārijāta makes the family name to be 
Kāsthā,' but this is most probably a wrong reading, as in the Mahárnava and the other works of Madanapāla the family name is distinctly stated to be Țāka. The pedigree of the family as gathered from the Madanapārijāta and the other works is given below. Some works such as the Mahârnava omit mention of Sahajapāla. About Sädhāraņa it is said that he brought about the remission of all taxes at the three tirthas ( Prayāga, Kasi

D.) and suggests the probable dates of the several kings that are set out in the note 1215, with reference to verses in the Madanapārijáta and other works. 
In the Süryasiddhāntaviveka of Madanapala the father of Madanapala is said to be Sahāraṇa1217 which is a Prakrit equivalent of Sadharana. Madanapāla appears to have been a very great patron of learned men and is said to have emulated the fame of Bhoja.1218 Besides the four works described above he compiled several other works, the most famous of which is his dictionary of drugs called Madanavinodanighantu. That work is very extensive, contains about 2250 verses and is divided into fourteen rargas, the last of which contains a prasasti of his family. 1319 This work contains the names of medical drugs, the qualities of drugs and of dishes and of the flesh of various animals. Some of the words givea as synonyms for Sanskrit words occur in the modern Marathi.1220 We saw above that his Smstikaumudi refers to Yantra-prakasa and Siddhantagarbha as two of his works. These two were works on astronomy. 
Another work of his is the Sürya-siddhantaviveka or Vásanārņava, which is a commentary on the Süryasiddhanta.

History of Dharmaśāstra

There is a ms. of this work in the Bhau Daji Collection of the Bombay Asiatic Society. 1221 Therein after giving his pedigree he says that by his works on Smrtiśāstra, on astronomy and mathematics and on medicine he came to be known as abhinava Bhoja.1222 In this treatise he refers to his own works already composed called Siddhāntagarbha 223 and Yantraprakāśa. He also refers to a Rajamțgānka of Bhoja and to Bhaskara's works. The ms. was copied in samvat 1459, i. e. 1402–3 A. D. In the colophon of this work his birudas (titles) are Panditapārijāta and Abhinava-Bhoja, and he is also styled Mahārājādhiraja.1234 In the Madanapārijāta and the Mahārnava the birudas are Panditapārijāta and Kataramalla or Kattāramalla. A work called Anandasanjivana on singing, dancing, musical instruments and rāgas is ascribed to Madanapāla.1225 The king Madana, son of Sahāraṇa, who is connected with the restoration of Medhătithi's bhāsya, must be this Madana. 
A great deal has been written concerning the date of Madanapala. The introductory verses giving the genealogy of Madanapàla must be held to be genuine, as they occur in the ancient ms. (D. C. Ms. No. 131 of A 1882-83 ) of Mabārnava copied in samvat 1645 ( 1588-89 A. D.) and in the still older ms. (dated samvat 1459 ) of the Sürya-siddhānta-viveka. As the Madanapārijāta mentions the Smộticandrikā and Hemadri's Caturvarga-cintamani not only in the introductory verses of the Madanapārijāta but in the body of the Madanapärijäta and the Mahārnava, Madanapala must be certainly later than 1300 A. D. As the Smrtikaumudi mentions the Vedāntakalpataru that was composed in the time of the Yadava princes Krsna and Mahadeva,

it follows that the work was composed after the third quarter of the 13th century. The Madanapărijāta is quoted in the Nțsimhaprasāda, the Antyeștipaddhati of Nārāyaṇabhatta, the Åbnikatattva vol. I. Tithi 17, Ahnika Tattva pp. 326, 336, 384, 419, Jyotistattva 656, Malamāsa 804, (Madanapărijāte-Madhava càryadhịta-Śātātapavacanåt ), 814; vol. II. Udvàha 140, Daya 175, Śuddhi 235. It may be noted that in the Madras Law Journal, vol. IX for 1899 in pp. 7-15, 54-70, 91-114 there are English translations of certain parts of the 8th stabaka of the Madana pārijāta of Raghunandana, the Srāddhakriyakaumudi (pp. 327, 489) of Govindananda. Therefore it is certainly earlier than 1500 A. D. And if we rely on the date when the ms. of the Sūryasiddhāntaviveka was copied ( viz. 1402–3 A. D.), it follows that Madanapăla flourished before 1400 A. D. The Madana vinodanighantul226 gives the date of its composition as ‘Brahma jagad-yugendu' of the Vikrama era, mugha 6 of the bright half and Monday (i, e. 8-1-1375 A. D.). This was inter preted by Sarvadhikari ( Tagoer Law Lectures pp. 297-298, ed. of 1922) as equal to 1231 of the Vikrama era (i. e. 1175 A, D.). He held that 'yuga' meant two. But herein he was entirely wrong. Besides, the date proposed by him is impossible, since it would lead us to hold that Madanapăla wrote in 1175 A. D. and since, as we saw above, he could not have flourished before 1300 A. D. It has been already shown (pp. 309, 369 ) that the view of Sarvadhikari and others that the Pārijāta mentioned by Candeśvara is the same as Madanapārijāta is quite wrong. Astronomical usage as found in Bhāskara and other writers always interprets yugal237 as meaning four (and not two ) and hence the date of the composition of the Madana vinodanighantu is 1431 of the Vikrama era (i. e. 1375 A. D.). Vide Jolly's Tagore Law Lectures pp. 14-15, Dr. Bhandarkar's

for the date. 1227 e.g. भास्कराचार्य in his गणिताध्याय (कालमानाध्याय verse 24) says 
'खखाभ्रदन्तसागरैर्युगाग्नियुग्मभूगुणैः । क्रमेण मूर्यवत्सरैः कृतादयो युगाङ्ग्यः ॥' where yt must mean 'four' and Jo is enį loyed for two.

Hence the literary activity of Madanapala and of bis protege, Visvesvarabhatta, must be placed between 1360. 1390 A. D. 
95. Madanaratna 
The Madanaratna is an extensive digest on Dharmaśāstra but only one part of it has been edited by the present author for the Anup Sanskrit Library of Bikaner and published in 1948. The Introduction to that edition (pp. VIII-IX ) may be consulted for more information. In the colophons of mss. it is also called Madanaratnapradipa or simply Madanapradipa. The work was divided into seven1228 sections called uddyotas on samaya (or kala), ācāra, vyavahāra, prāyaścitta, dāna, śuddhi, śānti. The order of the various sections was the one indicated, the samayo ddyota being the first part. I have not been able to examine the mss. of all the uddyotas. 
The Samayoddyota deals with the subjects usually treated of in works on kāla, viz. discussions about the year, the seasons, the months, the intercalary months, the rules about tithis, the rules about the proper times for various religious observances, gifts, homa, the rules about kalivarjya. 
There is a ms. of the Dānoddyota in the Anandāśrama collection at Poona ( No. 2378). Recently (i. e. in 1964) the Sanskrit Acadeniy of the Osmania University (Hyderabad, Deccan) published a part of the Dāna-vivekoddyota in the Sanskrit Academy Series (the General editor being Dr. Aryendra Sharma, M. A., D. Phil., Head of the Department of Sanskrit at the Osmania University and the Editors being Shri Khanderao Deshpande, M. A., and Shri D. G. Padhye, B. A. ( Kávyatirtha

Såhityalaökāra). The first printed part extends to 272 pages and it is stated that the whole work on Dâna to be published will occupy about 1100 pages in three parts í in all). The first part so far published has been well printed. There are seven parts of the Madanaratnapradipa which is a huge work, divided into seven parts, of which the first part on Vyavahāra was edited by me and published in 1948 for the Anup Sanskrit Library of Bikaner. The following are the subjects treated of :- eulogy of dāna; the nature of dana, various kinds of dānas; the constituent elements (angāni ) of dana; the donor, proper persons for gifts, persons underserving of gifts, what things cannot be given away, proper and improper times and places for dāna, measures of corn and other substances and weights and units of length &c., finding out the east and other directions, characteristics of a torana, patāka and mandapa, tula-puruşa ( weighing oneself against gold or silver ), gift of a thousand cows and other magaificent gifts, dedication of a tank or well and planting of a garden &c. In this work the author refers to Kalpataru and to Hemadri as a dākṣiṇātya nibandhakära. 
Deccan College ms. No. 392 of 1891-95 deals with the śānti section. It treats of rites for propitiating gods and planets and averting the evil consequences of great or small portentous phenomena, such as Vināyaka-snāna, sürya-śānti, navagraha-śānti, śāntis for birth on certain evil nakșatrus like mula, aśleşå and evil astrological conjunctions like vyatipāta, raidhrti, sankranti ; rites for the safety of the foetus and of the newly born infant; ayutahoma, laksahoma, kotihoma &c. In this section sages like Uttara-Garga, Kätyāyana, Nārada, Baijavāpa (on gļhya), Mānava-samhitī, Yájñavalkya, Saunaka and purānas like the Skanda, Bhavisyottara, Vişnudharmottara are very frequently cited. Besides the following are among the authors and works referred to :- Apekṣitārthadyotini, a commentary of Nārāyana, Karmavipākasamgraha, Karmavipäkasamuccaya, Kumāratantra promulgated by the son of Rāvana, Prayogasāra, Vijñānesvarā. cărya ( in the plural ). 
A ms. of the Acăroddyota is noticed by Burnell in his Tanjore Cat. (p. 137 b ). Stein (in his Cat. of Jammu mss.) notices an incomplete ms. of the Vyavahároddyota (p. 98 
806 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
No. 2437). M. M. Haraprasad Sastri notices a ms. of the Prāyaścittoddyota (Nepal Palm-leaf and Paper Mss. Cat. XVIII and p. 223). 
From the colophons at the end of the several mss. of the Madanaratna it appears that the work was composed under the patronage of king Madanasi:äha-deva, son of Śaktisinha.1229 The king is styled mahárājādhiraja and one of his titles is Kodanda paraśurāma (meaning 'who was a veritable Paraśurāma in wielding the bow). The introductory verses1230 to the Samayo ddyota in the Višrāmabāga collection and the Ulwar ms. refer to Delhi-deśa and its king named Mahāpåladeva. Then verse 9 speaks of Damodara whose exact relationship with Mahāpāladeva is not clear. Damodara is said to have made the yavanas of Mülasthäna (modern Multan in the Punjab) give up the slaughter ing of cows. The whole pedigree is given below.1231 Saktisimha is said to have eclipsed even Bhoja. It is further said that 
Madanasimha called1232 together four learned men viz., Ratnakara, Gopināth, Visvanātha and Gangādharabhatta and entrusted the composition of the digest to them. The colophon1233 at the

end of the śāntyuddyota in the Deccan College says that it was composed by Visvanátha, a resident of Benares and son of Bhattapüjya, a Srimāli Gurjara (Brāhmaṇa ). There is a similar colophon at the end of the Prāyaścittoddyota noticed by M, M. Haraprasad Sastri. 
The Vyavahāra section of the Madanaratna is a large work in 348 printed pages. It deals with both judicial procedure and the eighteen titles of law (Vyavahārapadas ). A brief analysis of its contents is set out here :- The nieaning of Vyavahāra, names of the titles of law; Sabha (court of justice) and its adjuncts; the king himself should preside over the court, or a judge (pràdvivāka ) should preside and may be helped by sabhyas (persons expert in law, as stated by Yāj. II, 2); requisite quali fications of judge and members of court; when the parties may appear through agents; modes of proof viz. documents, witnesses, possession; requisites of plaint and of the reply; requisites of royal edicts; contents of the decision in a legal dispute ; Pascātkāra and Jayapatra; inference of three kinds; characteristics of possession as means of proof; when ordeals are to be resorted to; nine kinds of ordeals; special oaths; details of the several ordeals; punishments may be of the body or in money (property); punishment for bràhmana is banishment (and not of the body) or shaving the head or making a mark on the forehead or banishing after seating him on an ass; when a judgement of a court may be reviewed; when a person is held to be major; recovery of debts is the first vyavahārapada (cause of legal dispute ) among the 18; when interest is allowed and the rates of interest; rule of dāmaduppata; mortgage and pledge and various kinds of them; surety of various kinds; rules about suretyship, debts and about the liability of the heirs of the surety; modes of covering debts when the debtor fails to pay; liability of son or other heirs to pay the debts of their father or ancestor ; deposits and the like; sale of or use of property by one not the owner of it; rules about property lost and found by one who is not the owner; rules about partnership and partners; non rendition or resumption of gifts; disputes between master and servant or herdsman; violation of compacts and the meaning of naigama and vrata, pūga, gana, sangha, gulma; repentance after purchase or sale or non-delivery after sale; breach of contract of

service; boundary disputes; abuse and defamation; assault and battery; theft; adultery; duties of husband and wife; partition of heritage; property not liable to partition; fresh partition as to concealed ancestral estate; definition of stridhana and kinds thereof; heirs to stridhana; heirs of sonless person; gambling and prize-fighting; miscellaneous. 
Since the Madanaratna mentions the Mit., the Kalpataru and Hemādri, Ratnakara and Madhaviya, it must be certainly later than about 1360 A. D. It is quoted as a great authority by the writers of the 16th and 17th centuries, such as Nārāyaṇabhatta, Kamalakarabhatta, Nilakantha and Mitramiśra. In the Vyava hāra-mayūkha Nilakaptha relies upon the Madanaratna as often as (if not oftener than ) the Mitāksarà. The Vyavahara-mayükha of Nilakantha published in BORI in 1926 mentions the Madana ratna or simply Madana about two dozen times; out of these on some pages such as pp. 98, 136, 145 of the text it shows that the Madanaratna differs from Vijñāneśvara, though on p. 139 it doubts the correctness of the explanation given by the Madana ratna. In other cases it cites the Madanaratna generally as supporting his own views. The Mayûkha quotes Smärtabhattā carya (i. e. Raghunandana ) on pp. 63 and 88 (text). On p. 88 (text) it mentions Vācaspati. The Madanaratnapradipa on Vyavahåra mentions ' Madhaviye-vidyāranyasricaraņāḥ'on pp. 86 and 360, while on pp. 18 and 20 it simply says 'Madhaviye': The Viramitrodaya1234 says that the author of the Madanaratna refers to the views of the Mitākṣarā, Kalpataru and Halāyudha. 
It may be noted that it states on p. 335 that the Samaya nirnayodyota and the Acāravivekodyota had already been compo sed by the author. It profusely quotes in Vyavahārodyota Manu, Yajñavalkya, Nárada, Katyayana and Bșhaspati. The Parasara màdbaviya references on pp. 18. 20. 86, 360 show that he held that Madhava was identical with Vidyaranya. This fact that an author who flourished in northern India about 1400 A. D. held

95. Madanaratna 
809 
this view strongly militates against father Heras' sweeping asser tions against the identity of the two. A remarkable matter is that he speaks of Dhāreśvara i. e. Bhoja .as bhatti'on p. 324 ( etat Sangrahakāramatam Dhåreśvarabhattenāpväsritam). Madana simha and his ancestors are spoken of as ruling the country about Delhi. Though Madanasiiñha bears tic higli-sounding title of mahārājādhiraja it is highly probable that he was some feudatory chief under the Mahomedan rules of Delhi. It is difficult to conceive of a period between 1300 and 1500 A. D. when a Hindu ruler was king of Delhi. It may be that during the troublous times of Muhammad Tughlak ( 1325-1351 A. D.), when the capital was transferred from Delhi to Doulatabad, or during the weak rule of the last kings of the Tugilak dynasty ( 1388-1413 A. D.). Madanasimha's predecessors might have usurped some territory about Delhi and ruled over it. At all events it would not be far from correct if the Madanaratna be placed about 1400 1450 A. D. M. M. Haraprasad Süstri (Report on palm-leaf and paper mss. from Nepal, Intro. pp. 31-32 ) tells us that the dynasty to which Madanasimhadeva belonged ruled over Gorakhapur-Champaran (Western Tirhut), that Madanasimha deva was preceded by Śaktisiiñhadeva, whose predecessor was Pộthvisimhadeva. The learned S.stri further says that a ms. of the Madanaratnapradipa-prāyaścittudyota applies the title ‘kodandaparasurama 'to Madana (p. 223 ), thai a ms. of the Amarakośa was copied in samvat 1511 (1451-55 A. D.) when Madanasimha ruled over Campakāraṇyanagara ( p. 51 of the body of the Report) and that a ms. of the Narasi hapurāna was copied in La-sam 339 ( 1457-58 A. D.) when Mahārājadhiraja Madana sim hadeva ruled over Goraksapura i. e. modern Gorakbpur (p. 29 of the Report ). It is likely that some confusion arose among the scribes of the work owing to the fact that two chieftains bearing the name Madanasimha flourished at the same period near Delhi and Gorakhpur. Tie great similarity of the names Madanapala and Madanasimha misled J. C. Ghose ( Hindu Law, vol. II, p. xiv. ed. of 1917) into holding that the Madanapărijāta and the Madanaratna were written under Madanapala. But it is clear from the ancestry of the two kings, Madanapala and Madanasimha, and the names of the real authors of the digests (Madanapärijāta and Madanaratna) that they have no connection with each other.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
96. Vidyāpati 
In the first edition of the History of Dharmasāstra, Vidyāpati was not dealt with in the body of the text, but some information about him and his works was given in the list of authors on pp. 739–40. It is thought advisable that a separate section be de voted to Vidyapati in this revised edition, Dr. Umesh Mishra published in Hindi1235 a life of Vidyapati; he gives the pedigree which shows that he was fourth in descent from Dhireśvara, uncle of Candeśvara. That work deals at some length with the lineage of Vidyāpati, gives a brief account of the kings of Mithila, the times of Vidyāpati, his works his padas, (songs) his learning and similar matters. There is difference of opinion about the date of his birth among scholars but there appears to be agreement about the date of his death viz. 1448 A. D. His birth place was Bisapi, a village in Madhubani ( lit. forest of honey) on the eastern side of north Bihar. The ‘Love Songs of Vidyāpati', translated into English from Maithili by Mr. Deben Bhattacharya and edited with an Introduction, Notes and comments by W. G. Archer, were published in London in 1963 by George Allen and Unwin (Ltd.). It was preceded by the publication of the Songs of Vidyāpati rendered into English by Shri Subhadra Jha in 1954, published by Messrs Motilal Banarsidas (of Benares ). 
This edition of 1954 contains an introduction of 193 pages, Maithili text of 212 songs with an English rendering on the opposite page of the song and mentions the rägas in which they are to be recited. Vidyapati is famous for his songs; he is also credited with the authorship of twelve works in Sanskrit (vide note below). 1236

Dr. Mishra sets out the contents of the grant on pp. 2–3. The grant is dated in La, Sari, 293. Dr. Mishra refers to Intro ductory verses 7-12. The names of his twelve works are :-- THÁFHIT (or - वाक्यावली), दानवाक्यावली, वर्षकृत्य (or वर्षक्रिया), विभागसार, भूपरिक्रमण (or FFHT), gotat, format, Fiíšeni, afa gatht, 44191FT वली, दुर्गाभक्तितरङ्गिणी, व्याडीभक्तितरङ्गिणी. रघुनन्दन, in his मलमासतत्त्व (vol I. p. 823 ), refers to arrest as faangfarenhet aantareata.

Vidyāpati 
In the edition by Shri Subhadra Jha the Introduction on p. 18 sets out a pedigree of the poet Vidyāpati viz. his father was Gana pati, whose father was Jayadatta, son of Dhireśvara. Most of the dates referring to Vidyāpati are in the Laksmanasena era. No one knows for certain when this era was started. Dr. Rajendralal Mitra held that the La-sam. (i, e. Laksmanasena era) starts from 1106 A. D. Kielhorn held that the La-Sam. started in 1119-20 of the Christian era. Several scholars regard the Bisapi plate as spurious. Further, several scholers say that the La-Sam. started from the date of the birth of Lakṣmaṇasena, The Sena kings are called Brahma-khatriyas. For the Inscriptions of Sena Kings, vide E. I. Vol. 20 Appendix Nos. 1682-1693 and "Indian Culture' vol. IV pp. 22 ff. Shri. G. C. Basu (of Dacca University) in New Indian Antiquary' (Vol. VII pp. 49--57) mentions a hitherto unknown work of Vidyàpati viz. Vyädjbhaktitarangini (lit, a river of devotion to the serpent goddess Manasā). It is a Tāptrika work. The Ms, refers to the Durgābhaktitarangini as his own work. 
He was a voluminous and versatile writer. A few words may be said here about some of the other works,

Vidyāpati's name is as great in Bengal as in Mithilà and it is curious that in Bengal Vidyāpati is believed to have been a great Vaisnava, while in Mithilà he was held to be a Saiva. 1237 The poems of Vidyapati were edited and published by Khagendranath Mitra.

and re-arranged the work and has puplished it in Devanagari characters along with a very elaborate and informative introduc tion of 132 pages ( in 1953 ). There is great difference of opinion about what padas were the genuine works of Vidyāpati. In this latest edition the editor had to reject 203 padas, which had been wrongly ascribed to Vidyāpati by the editor Babu Nagendranatha Gupta (vide J. of G. J. R. Institute Vol. X. pp. 175-196 Review). 
For Vidyàpati's Purusapariksā, vide No. 1922 in Mitra's Notices (vol. V pp. 244-46). The work was written under the orders of King Śivasimha , son of King Devasimha , of Mithila. It has four paricchedas and contains over forty stories about heroism, benevolence, dayā (kindness), theft, cowardice, a lazy man, a clever man &c. The Purusapariksă was rendered into English by Sir George A. Grierson and was published in 1935 by the Royal Asiatic Society, London. The translation contains 44 tales in all, most of them being arranged in groups e. g. there are at first four tales of heroic men and four tales about men of the opposite type. Grierson published a paper on 'Vidyapati and his contemporaries' in I. A. Vol. XIV (1885) pp. 182-196. On pp. 190-191 of that volume the original Sanskrit of the Bisapi plate and its translation into English are set out. It is dated in several eras, san 807, sainvat 1455 and sake 1321 (and L. Sam. 283, Sravana suidi 7). The Ms. of the Bhagavata Purana copied by Vidyapati bears the date · La. Sam. 349' says Dr. Jayakanta, while others read that date as La. Sam. 349 or 389 (vide History of Maithili Literature, vol. I. p. 185. 
He may be held to have flourished between 1360-1448 A. D. and should be placed just about the times of Sulapāņi. Vide Journal of Department of Letters for 1929, vol. 16, for an informing paper on him.

The two verses at the end of the work are quoted below.1238 They are clear on the point that the work was composed by the Queen and that all that Vidyāpati did was that he studied certain works and made her work look faultless by providing it with authorities from several nibandhas that he studied. It is clear that the work was that of the Queen and Vidyāpati only supplied some textual authorities in support of her propositions. 
An exeellent edition of the Gangāvākyāvali of Queen Viśvā sadevi, Queen of Padmasimha ( along with the Dvärakāpattala by Binabai) was published as volumes III and IV (as part of the Contribution of Women to Sanskrit Literature ) by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri in 1940 at Calcutta, with a Foreword by Dr. C, Otto Blagden and with five Appendices one of which contained some remarks on the autborship of the work (pp. 105-108 ) and on members of the royal family of Mithilă ( 15 in all) and some well-known Smārta writers who quoted the Gangāvākyāvali. Viśvāsadevi was the wife of Padmasimha, son of Sivasimha, king of Mithilā.1239 Padmasimha became the king of Mithilā on

Sivasimha's death and on the death of Padmasiṁha Visvasadevi ascended the throne. The work has 29 chapters dealing with such matters as remembering the Ganges, uttering its name, pil grimage to it, hearing the eulogy of the Ganges, seeing it, bowing down to it, śrāddha to be performed on it, bathing in it, offering libations ( tarpana ), counting beads (japa ), gifts on it and offer ing pindas and residing on it; prāyascittas, voluntary or natural death (mộtyu ), putting the bones of the dead in the waters, baths at the confluence of the Ganges and the Sea &c. 
For the Vibhāgasăra' of Vidyāpati, vide Mitra's Notices Vol. VI pp. 67-8. It deals with the meaning of 'Daya', nature of partition, what is not liable to partition, disquisition on Stri dhana ( woman's property ) and its partition among heirs, division of wealth concealed, but later found partition among those who are born of persons that had partitioned; description of the twelve kinds of sons and partition among them; heirs to person dying without male issue; partition of wealth among persons who had reunited after partition. 
The Dänavākyāvali is described (on p. 352 of Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar's Report on the search for Sanskrit Mss. for the year 1883–84) as composed by Dhiramati, queen of king Darpanārāyaṇa of Mithila, who was herself learned and who permitted the very clever Vidyāpati to render it faultless with authoritative texts. 1940 
One of Vidyāpati's works is Bhūparikramana of which a complete copy exists in the Mss. Library of the Sanskrit College of Calcutta. Some account of this work is given by Sri Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya in J. G. J. R. I. Vol. VI at pp. 241-247. That work shows that Vidyāpati had sākta leanings. His work seems to have been called Dvaitanirnaya (or Agamadvaitanirnaya).

97. Vyavahāranirnaya of Varadarāja Twelve years after the first volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra was published in 1930), Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar and his pupil Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar published in the Adyar Library Series ( Madras ) an edition of the Vyava hàranirnaya of Varadarāja based on nine mss. 
One remarkable feature of the work is that it has no Mangala śloka at the beginning. Prof. Aiyangar suggests that this is so because it is only a part of a large work. I am not satisfied with the suggestion. The work could have been begun by saying ' after completing the part on the subject already finished I (or Varadaraja ) begin '&c. 
There are four well-known South Indian works on several branches of Dharmaśāstra including Vyavahāra viz. the Smộticanr drikā,the Parāśaramadhaviya, the Vyavahāra-nirnaya of Varada raja and the Smộtimuktàphala of Vaidyanātha Diksita ( composed sometime about or after 1700 A. D.), the Vya. N. dealing only with Vyavahāra. The Miràksarà also may be regarded as South Indian, since Vijñāneśvara composed it in the domains of the Călukya emperor Vikramärka. All except the last two were published early. 
In this edition there is a preface (pp. IX-XX), an Introduc tion (pp. XXIII-LXII), synopsis of its contents, comparative statement of the authorities on Vyavahāra cited in the Mitākṣarā, Smộti-candrika, Vyavahăranimaya, Parāśara-madhaviya, table of contents in Sanskrit (pp. 1-28 ) the text (pp. 1-534), names of

authors and works quoted with references to pages where they occur (pp. 538–547). Inspite of the large bulk of this publi cation the main work will not cover more than half of the Mitakşară on the Vyavahāra section of Yajñavalkya. Each page of it bas various readings placed one below another and the result is that 1/3 or 1/4 portion of most of the pages contain only the various readings ( rarely one half of the page e. g. pp. 114, 183, 234, 236-37, 476). The Editor quotes frequently in the foot notes Narada-Manusamhita and Bhavasvāmin's bhāsya (e. g. on pp. 304-5, 323-24, 336–37, 379, 382-83). Varadaraja's explanations are often the same as in the Mit. (e. g. on pp. 67, 239, 241, 251, 321, 413–14, 420-21, 480 ) and therefore one may hold that he borrows from that work (particularly as he mentions Vijñāneśvara on p. 78 and appears to refer to hin as the most eminent among those who have realized brahman on pp. 253, 270). He does not enter into discussion on knotty points like those in Yaj. II. 21, II. 24 or whether ownership arises on partition (vibhāgāt-sva-tvam uta svasya sato vibhāgah). On p. 521 he quotes the two verses of Yaj. II. 305, 306 on review of judgment but has not a word in explanation while the Mit. comments on them at length. On Yàj. II. 100--102 the Mit. has three closely printed pages of explanation, while the Vya. N. quotes the verses on p. 154 but has not a word of explanation. Similarly on Yāj. II. 118-119 the Mit. explains in two closely printed pages, while the Vya. N, which quotes both on pp. 442-443, has hardly any explanation. 
On the whole the Vyavahāranirnaya is a pedestrian perform ance. In spite of the labour bestowed by the editors on this work, one is surprised at the mistakes committed by them in some places. A few are cited here. On pp. 120-121 the Vy. N. quotes as Yajñavalkya's the verses 'uktepi sākṣibhiḥ' &c. (Yāj. II. 80 and 83 ) but in the alphabetical Sanskrit index of verses it is noted (on pp. 580 and 712 ) that the two verses are anāmaka ( without name ). Similarly, on p. 386 the Vy. N. quotes Yaj. I. 65 (dattām api haret &c.) and Yáj. 11, 146 (daitvå kanyảm &c.) but there is a footnote ( 4 ) on the sanie page that those passages of Yaj. are not found in the printed Yajñavalkya. 
The Vy. N. quotes many Smrtis and some works and authors of which the following deserve to be noted. Akhardadarśa (p. 434), Agnimitra (p. 130 ), Asahāya (pp. 135, 230, 455), Udyo 
97. Vyavaharanirnaya of Varadarają 
817 
tana (pp. 78, 455 ), Kavaşa (p. 471), Krsna (pp. 78, 278 ), Kautilya (pp. 284-85), Charmadrona (p. 353 either a work or author ), Dhāreśvara ( pp. 78, 135 ), Bhattakumāra ( pp. 78, 135 ), Pañcădhyāyi (pp. 132, 357), Vijñānešvara (p. 78), Śrikara (p. 135 ), Svāyambhuvāgama (p. 14), Acārya Viśvarūpa (pp. 78, 135, 474). 
The Vy. N. nowhere refers to Bhäruci who was comparatively an early author on Dharmaśāstra. 
It is interesting to note that the Vy. N. (on pp. 284–85) quotes a passage from Kautilya's Arthasāstra about the payment of Dakşină when one of the several priests required in Agnistoma and other Vedic sacrifices falls ill before the whole sacrifice is finished. 
The date of Varadaraja lias now to be discussed. As he mentions Vijñāneśvara, designates him 'brahmavitpravara' and appears to have copicd the very words of the Mitākşară (as indi cated above and as admitted by Prof. Aiyangar on p. XXVIII of the Introduction ), he must be held to be at least one generation later than the Mitākṣarā. It has been shown above that the Mit. cannot be placed later than 1100-1120 A. D. I regret to say that I cannot accept the encomiums that the late Professor showers on Varadaraja on p. xxix ( as being independent, original as to interpretation and endowed with conimand over Mimāṁså and Nyaya). To me he appears to be a puny figure in the matter of Mimāṁsā applied to Dharmasastra as compared with the vast erudition shown by the Mitäkşarà. Here I cannot deal with the arguments of Prof. Aiyangar. Varadaraja is earlier than 1515 A. D. That is certain. So one has to find out how much earlier he can be placed. 
Prof. Aiyangar (on p. LXVI of the Introduction) refers to p. 459 of the Vy. N. where the Vedic text 'tasmāt striyo nirindriya adàyādir 'is cited and explaired. On p. LXVI of the Introduction he remarks that the interpretation of 'nirindriyāḥ' as applied to women in Manusr rti (in IX. 18) by Varadarāja is original and was not anticipated by any previous writer. This is a bold and sweeping statement. Much of the medieval literature is still unpublished and buried in Mss. and chronology is uncertain and a large part has perished beyond recovery. The most important 
H. D.-103 
818 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
point of construction of the Vedic text is that it is not to be taken literally and as prohibiting women as inheritors of family property. It may be shown to be restricted in import in various ways. To be brief, Aparårka whose commentary on Yaj. cannot be placed later than 1140 A. D. has a similar explanation. The Manusmộti (IX. 18) refers to the Vedic passage and says 'nirindriyà hyamantràśca striyoşnstam-iti sthitiḥ'. Aparärka held it was a mere artharāda, not to be taken literally, and that that passage refers to cases where a son exists. The Smsticandrikā also holds that the śruti is an arthavāda and refers to women other than those that are expressly named as heirs. The Parāśara Madhaviya also explains it as indicating that the wife of the sacri ficer has no right to partake of the Soma drink. Madhavācārya is the most learned writer among Daksiņàtyas. His greatness and fame stand only second to the great Sankarācārya. 
The Parāśaramadhaviya is one of his earliest works. The Kàlanirnaya expressly says that it was composed after the com mentary on the Parăsarasmộti. Therefore the Parăśara-Mădhaviya cannot be dated later than about 1340 A. D. Great controversies bave raged round Madhava and Vidyaranya. There are some scholars who deny their identity (vide J. of Indian History Vol. XII pp. 241-250 by Doraiswami Iyengar ). Unfortunately secta rian zeal of Vaisnavas and non-Vaisnavas in South India also appears to play a part in these discussions. Prof. Aiyangar's discussion about Varadarāja and Madhava smacks of these ten dencies. Some undisputed facts must be first stated. Varadaraja is a very common name in the Tamil country as the presiding deity at Kàncīpura is named Varadaraja (admitted on p. XLVII ), Varadarāja is not referred to anywhere by Madhava (admitted by Prof. Aiyangar on p. XLVIII of Intro. to Vy. N. ). But he musters courage to say 'In spite of the absence of some reference to Varadarāja's work, it is incredible that it should not have been known to Madhava'. The belief of a person however learned he may be is worth little. It is the reasons for that belief that matter. Prof. Aiyangar may believe anything but it is his reasons that have to be examined. If one scholar says that Varadarāja borrows from Madhava, he cannot be silenced by another simply saying he does not believe that at all. What are the grounds of this sweeping assertion ? On p. 414 the Vyavabaranirnaya quotes 
97. Vyavaharanirnaya of Varadarāja/ 
819 
a verse (quoted in note below )1242 as from Prajāpati about some matters forbidden in Kaliyuga. The same passage occurs in the Mit.on Yaj. II. 117. The Mit. composed in about 1100 A. D. could not have borrowed it from Vy. N. The same passage is quoted in the Smsticandrikà as from Sangrahakāra (Vyavahāra p. 266 Gharpure). In the Sac-carita-raksā (p. 47 Venk. Press ed.) of Vedāntadesika there is a verse of Yama quoted from Skandapurāņa, the reading of which was changed in a work called Varadarājiya-Smsti-Sangraha. On p. XLVI ( Intro.) Prof. Aiyangar refers to certain remarks of Vedāntadesika in his Saccaritaraksā viz. that the topic of sanctified food for Vaisnavas had been treated by Yamunācărya ard elucidated by the learned Varadarāja-pandita in his Sanmārgadipikà and that he (Vedānta desika ) follows in their footsteps. Prof. Aivangar at once jumps to the conclusion that the Smộtisangraha of Varadarāja referred to by Vedāntadesika must be the work of Varadarāja, who is the author of Vy. Nirnaya. Prof. Aiyangar complacently observes (P. XLVI of Intro.) As the topic comes within the scope of Dharmasastra, there is no reascnable ground for ascribing the Sanmārgadipika to a Varadarīja different from the author of the Smộtisangraba'. There are very reasonable and strong grounds for scouting all the remarks of Prof. Aiyangar. In the first place, the Varadaraja of Vy. N. gives no information about himself. He nowhere states that it is a part of a larger work nor does he mention any work called Smộtisangraha. Besides, Varadarāja is a very common name in the Tamil country as he admits (p. XLVII of Introduction ). The Smsticandrikā on Vyavahāra (p. 36 ) quotes five verses from Sangrahakāra about the chara cteristics of a proper plaint in a suit. The same five verses, are quoted by the Mit on Yaj. II. 9 with the words • Yathoktam', Ttiese five verses are not found in Vy. N. Therefore, the Sangra ha or Smsti-Sangraha known to the Mit. and Smsticandrika is entirely different from the Smộtisangraha of Varadaraja. Prof. Aiyangar unnecessarily parades (on p. XXXVII of Intro.) the colophons of the Mss. used by him for editing the Vy. N. The words 'Śrinad-Varadarājiye vyavuhära-nirnaye' or 'Srimad Varadarajiye Dharmaśāstre vyavahāranirnaye' mean nothing more

than · Varadarājena prokta ' (expounded by Varadarāja ) accord ing to Panini IV. 3. 101 tena proktam'. If one looks into the various catalogues of Sanskrit mss. (such as Aufrecht's ) one would find that there are more than two dozen authors called Varadarāja. There is at present absolutely no evidence (except the sameness of name ) that the Smộtisangraha of Varadarāja mentioned in note 3 on p. XLVII is the work of the same Varada rāja who is the author of the Vy. N. Granting for a moment that Vedāntadesika's Saccaritaraksă was composed about 1297 A. D. (as asserted on p. XLV of introduction to Vy. N.) there is no substantial evidence to connect that Smộtisangraha with the author of the Vy. N. beyond the mere name. It has been shown above (under Kalpataru of Laksmidhara) that scholars have had grave doubts about the dates of the successors of Sri Ramanujācārya and the dates assigned to them by their own Vaisnava writers and the traditions of the Vadagalai and the Tengalai scholars. That being the case, I take exception to the statement on p. XLVI (of Intro.) that Varadarajapandita ( author of Sanmärgadipikā) is identical with the Varadaraja. author of Vy. N. Again I take strong objection to the remark on p. XLVIII that a comparison of the two works (Parāśaramadhaviya and Vy. N.) establishes the superior learning and acuteness of the Varadarājiya and its greater originality. I have shown above how mediocre is the work called Vy. N. as compared with the Mitākşarà and I hold on the evidence available so far that the author of Vy. N. is later than the Mādhaviya and borrows from the Madhaviya. 
For reasons of space it is impossible to criticize at length the many debatable points in Prof. Aiyangar's Introduction, parti cularly about the chronological relation between the Smsticandrika and Paràsara-madhaviya on the one hand and the Vy. N. on the other. On pp. LIV-IV i Intro.) he refers to Prajāpati quoting the verse about Niyoga, unequal partition and the immolation of a cow. That verse is quoted from Sangraha by the Smộticandrikā (vide pote 1241 above ). Prajapati is not cited even once by Visvarüpa on Yāj. The Mit. quotes Prajā pati as Smrti only in three places viz. on Yaj. III. 20 ( on asauca and the birth of a son), III. 25 (again on āśauca ) and II. 260 (penance for a person guilty of adultery with even the low caste wife of his brāhmaṇa guru). The Mit. does not quote Prajāpati on acāra and Vyavabāra. Aparărka97. Vyavahāranirnaya of Varadaraj 
821 
quotes only four verses of Prajāpati on ācāra, two on Vyavahāra, and one on āśauca and one prose passage on the four kinds of Sannyāsins. The Kștyakalpataru (on Vyavahāra ) quotes only three verses of Prajāpati. That establishes that Prajāpati's work was either non-existent or negligible in the 9th century A. D., was very sparingly relied upon even upto the 12th century A. D. and was a very minor authority as compared with Bệhaspati, Katyāyana and many others. The Smsticandrika quotes from Prajāpati about eleven verses on Ahnika, about 21 on Vyavahära and about three on Srāddha. The Smộticandrikā would have to be placed at the latest about 1220-1250 A. D. (as Hemàdri quotes it very frequently). Turning to the Vyavahāra-nirnaya which is a much smaller work (being confined only to Vyavahāra) it quotes about 86 verses of Prajāpati, of which about 46 relate to ordeals alone. Another remarkable circumstance is that Vy. N. was composed at a time when weekdays and Sankranti had come very much to the fore even in judicial matters such as trial by ordeals. 
Besides, the Smrticandrikå even on the section on Vyavahara covers (in Gharpure's ed.) 322 closely printed pages of a very large size (with hardly a line for various readings ), with about 32 lines on each page each line containing from 24 to 38 letters. The Vy. N. has only 534 pages of a smaller size with about 12 to 23 lines (of texts ) on each page and a much smaller number of letters from 16 to 28 in each line. The Smsticandrikā text on Vyavahāra contains far more matter than the text in the whole of the Vyavahăranirnaya. From these facts it may be concluded that the Smsticandrikā, though inore extensive on Vyavahāra than the Vy. N., quotes Prajapati less than half as many times as the Vy. N. does. That is Vy. N. had a much more inflated text of Prajapati than what even the Smsticandrikå had before it and so it probably is a great deal later than the Smộticandrikā. Simi larly, the Madhaviya on Vyavahåra quotes from Prajapati only 35 verses on Vyavahāra of which eleven refer to ordeals. 
Prof. Aiyangar attaches undue importance to the quotations from Prajapati in Vy. N. Prajapati is not one among the many authors on Dharmaśāstra named in Yāj. I. 4-5 nor among the thirtysix expounders of Dharma named by Paithinasi quoted by the Smrticandrikä on its first page. The Parāśaramadhaviya on 
822 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
Vyavahāra quotes only 31 verses from Prajapati of which only eleven are concerned with ordeals, while Vy. N. quotes 86 verses from Prajapati on Vyavahāra, of which 46 are concerned with ordeals. The above facts should be held to lead to the conclusion that Vy. N. had before it a far more inflated text of Prajāpati than what the Madhaviya had before it. Critical scholars should not be impressed or influenced by the mention of an ancient name tacked to verses by Medieval writers. The Manusmộti (in I. 34-35 ) says that the first human being created by Virāj was Manu who created ten Prajāpatis viz. Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Pracetas, Vasistha, Bhỉgu and Nārada, from all of whom verses on Dharma topics are quoted by the Mit., Aparárka and Smsticandrikā. That shows that works were palmed off on people as composed by primeval sages, though composed by scholars in medieval historic times in order to make them appear very authoritative. 
The sources of Dharma were chiefly three, viz. Śruti (or Veda ), Smộtis and customs (vide Gaut. Dh. S. I. 1-2, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 1. 2, Vas. Dh. S. I. 4-6, Manu II. 6 ) and the theory was that each succeeding one was inferior in authority to each preced ing one. In the march of ages certain practices that prevailed in the Vedic times (such as Niyoga) and even in the times of the Smstis (such as marriage of a brāhmana with a woman of the the Ksatriya or Vaisya varna ) went out of vogue and new ones came to be observed. In some cases, therefore, changes were introduced or recommended by learned men interpreting vedic texts as merely arthavādas ( not to be taken literally) and by even changing the words of the texts. For example, the Kalpataru (on Vyavahāra p. 691 ) and Dayatattva12+2 (Jivananda ed. p. 185) provide by quoting Devala that the Stridhana of a woman dying childless is taken (on her death ) by her husband or by her mother or by her brother or by her father. But writers from Kamarûpa (Assam ) read the same verse as ( aprajāyām hared bhartă bhrătă måtà pitàpi vā). Vide Pandit Manoranjan Sastri's paper in 
• Prāgjyotişa Souvenir' (published at the time of the 22nd Session of the All India Oriental Conference in Jan. 1965). Bịhaspati

prescribes that the stridhana of a woman on her death passes to her sons and to daughters that are unmarried, but the married daughter (in such a case ) receives a small part as a token of honour to her. The Dāyabhàga by a slight change (samudha to na labhen-mātņkam dhanam') denies to the married daughter the right to receive even a token part of her mother's stridhana. 
In the above cases the original text must have been only of one tenor, but by a slight change the same verse is made to yield a different sense. 
As this Varadarāja is quoted in several places in the Vyava hārakảnda of the Sarasvativilāsa of Prataparudra (on pp. 135, 179, 268,269, 276, 319), his work must be earlier than about 1500 A. D. as Pratāparudra ruled from 1497 to 1538 A. D. and refers to him as one among àdhunika writers (p. 325). It should be noted that the Sarasvativilăsa, which quotes Aparărka many times (as on pp. 230, 262, 264, 308, 344_45, 354, 367 &c.) and the Can drikäkära (i. e. author of Smộticandrikā ) dozens of times (as on pp. 212, 230, 235, 242, 264, 267, 275, 308, 350 ) never speaks of Aparārka or the Candrikā or Smrticandrika as adhunika. The Smsticandrika would have to be placed between 1200-1240 A. D. as it quotes Aparărka and is quoted very largely by Hemādri. Therefore Varadarāja must be later than 1300 A. D. and would have to be assigned to a period between 1450–1495 A. D. (in order that he may be styled Ådhunika in a work composed in the first quarter of the 16th century).

98. Sūlapāņi 
Jimütavahana, Sūlapini and Raghunındana are the three leading and very eminent writers on Dharmaśāstra from Bengal, Rai Bahadur Manomohan Chakravarti in his learned and long paper • Contributions to the History of Snısti in Bengal and Mithila ' in J. A. S. B. ( New Series) Vol. XI (1915) deals with Bengal authors on Smsti in pp. 311-406 and deals with Sūlapāni in pp. 336–343 giving a very interesting account of his works and time. 
The earliest work of Śülapāņi appears to have been his Dipa kalikā, a commentary on the smiřti of Yājñavalkya. It is a very brief commentary. Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti had no

printed edition of the Dipakalikā and relied upon a ms. from the Sanskrit College. The Dipakalikālz43 was published by Mr. Gharpure in 1939 in his series of Hindu Law texts. Raghu. nandana quotes or refers to it very often in spite of its small size (vide vol. I, Sraddha, pp. 201, 208, 225, 247; Ahnika 454; Prayascitta 543, 546; vol. II Udvaha 138, Vyavahara 224, 225; Divya 577. The portion on the dayabhāga section (Yajnavalkya II, verses 114-149) is contained in five printed pages ( vide Ghose's Hindu Law, edition of 1917, vol. II. pp. 550-554). In this commentary, besides the sages he names only a few writers and works on dharma, e. g. the Kalpataru, Govindaraja, the Mitākṣarā, Medhātithi and Viśvarúpa. He entertained somewhat archaic views on matters of inheritance. For example, he holds that the text speaking of the right of the parents to succeed before the brothers of the deceased has reference to property acquired by the deceased from his father or grand-father. He explained the word 'apratisthita' in the sutra of Gautama 'stridhanam duhi tļņāmaprattānām-apratișthitānāṁ ca' in the same way as Apararka, Jimitavahana and the Smrticandrika.1244 He says that a full brother though not re-united succeeded before a half-brother 
1243 The दीपकलिका ( ed. by Gharpure ) covers only 110 pages but 
mentions a large number of smrti works, and authors : गौतम धर्मसूत्र, बोधायन, बृहस्पति, वृद्धबृहस्पति, भरद्वाज, मनु, बृहन्मनु ( verse अन्यायोपात्त.), वृद्धमनु ( verse अपुत्रा शयनं ), मरीचि, यम, वसिष्ठ, विश्वरूप (p. 81), विश्वामित्र, विष्णु, व्यास, शङ्ख ( prose once), शङ्खलिखित (prose 12 times ), शातातप, वृद्धशातातप, शौनक ( once), संवर्त, सनन्द (once), सुमन्तु, हारीत ( both prose and verse ), कल्पतरु, छन्दोगपरिशिष्ट, महा भारत ( 4 times ), रामायण ( once आकारश्छद्यमानोपि०), आयुर्वेद (once), सुश्रुत ( twice). It quotes several पुराण ( some of them often ) आदि, कूर्म, नृसिंह, पद्म, ब्रह्म ( 10 times), भविष्य ( 13 times ), मार्कण्डेय, विष्णु, स्कन्द. In प्राय. वि. pp. 390-91 he states-'विवाह्याविवाह्यस्त्री विशेषश्च याज्ञवल्क्यटीकायामस्माभिरभिहितः । सगोत्रादिकन्यानां चाज्ञानतो विवाह इदं यथा बौधायनः सगोत्रां चेदमत्योपगच्छेत् मातृवेदनां बिभृयात् । प्रजाता चेत् कृच्छाब्दपादं चरित्वा जन्मन आत्मनो वेदाग्निभूतः पुनरग्निश्चक्षुरादित्येताभ्यां

though re-united.1346 This explanation of the much canvassed verse of Yāj. offered by Sulapāņi is referred to by the Viramitro daya.1248 The Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana several times refers to Sūlapāpi's explanations of Yáj. 1247 
In the Prayaścittaviveka (p. 390 of Jivananda's ed.) Śūlapāņi states that he has already composed a commentary on Yåj. The Suddhitattva (vol. II p. 380) mentions that solapani also com posed • Parisista-dipakalikā': 
Šūlapāņi wrote several small treatises on topics of dharma sāstra. It is doubtful whether he contemplated or proposed to make them parts of a huge digest on Smrti. At least twelve tractales of his ending in the wotd • Viveka’ are known. Chakra varti on p. 337 of his paper opines that the several 'small treatises formed parts of general treatise by name the Smrtiviveka.' With great respect I demur to this conclusion. He nowhere drops even a hint that he meant these large and small treatises to be parts of a Smộtiviveka viz. Ekadasi-viveka, Tithi-viveka, Dattaka-viveka, Durgotsavaprayoga-viveka, Durgotsava-viveka, Dolayātrā-viveka, Pratişthà-viveka, Prāyaścitta-viveka, Rasayātrā-viveka, Vratakāla viveka, Suddhi-viveka, Srāddha-viveka, Samkrānti-viveka, Sam bandha-viveka (on marriage ). Of these the Durgotsavaviveka seems to have been amongst his latest works, since he names therein five of his vivekas on durgotsava-prayoga, pratisthā, prāyāscitta, suddhi and śràddha. The Śrăddha-viveka is the most famous of his works and has been printed. His Prāyaścittaviveka and Durgotsava-viveka have also been published, the former by Jivananda (1893) and the latter by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parisad at Calcutta in Bengali characters. In the Durgotsava-viveka he deals with the worship of Durga in Asvina and also in spring (hence the deity is called Vasanti). In the Durgotsava viveka, besides such purāņas as the Kalıkā, Bhavisyottara, Bhāgayata,

Devi, he names a host of writers and works as noted below.1248 In spite of Aufrecht's view the Samvatsara-pradipa is not his own work. The Samvatsarapradipa mentioned by Śülapāni in Durgo tsavaviveka appears to have been a work of Halayudha, as Raghu nandana states in Ekādasitattva (vol. II. p. 51, “Samvatsara pradipe Halāyudhopi etanmatīnusāri') and in Suddhi (Vol. II p. 327 ata eva samvatsara-pradipe Halayudhenoktam ). The Samvatsarapradipa without the author's name is quoted by Raghunandana many times, as in (vol. I) Tithi (pp. 34, 43, 49, 106 ); Śrāddha, p. 250, Prāyaścitta p. 508, Malamasa pp. 754, 848; in vol. II Ekadasi pp. 8, 40, 61-62, 65, 83, and Suddhi 382. A Sårasamuccaya is also mentioned in Hemādri (Dānakhanda page 135). The Smstisāgara is probably the same as the Govindārņava of Seșa Nțsimha, Srikaramišra is probably the ancient author referred to even by the Mitakşară. 
Sûlapāņi is mentioned by name by Raghunandana in some places without any title ( as in vol. I Malamasa pp. 748, 854–55; Vol. II. p. 577 Divya ), sometimes as upadhyāya (vol. I. Daya 175 ) and very often as Mahāmahopadhyāya (as in vol. I Prāyas citta pp. 528, 553; vol. II. Vyavahāra p. 197, Suddhi p. 296 ). Brief notes may be added on a few of his works. 
The Sambandhaviveka1249 was edited by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri (Calcutta ) in 1942 with an Introduction of 23 pages dealing with the origin and development of the forms of marriage (8 forms in the Gaut. Dh. S. and in Aśv. Gș. I. 6) and contain

सारसमुच्चय, स्मृतिसागर. 1249 The text in the edition by Dr. Chaudhuri of the Sambandha 
vivek u contains only 15 pages. But about one-third or more of each page is covered by various readings. So the text by itself would occupy only about six or seven printed pages of a small size book in modern times. As there were hardly any printing presses for Sanskrit works before the advent of the British and as the different parts of India were separated by the barriers of language and usages and were governed by different dynasties, each region produced its own compilations in Sanskrit, particularly on matters of Dharmaśāstra.

ing a few remarks on the work of Sūlapāņi. A work of the same name by Bhavadevabhatta who flourished at least three centuries before Sûlapāņi has also been edited by Dr. S. C. Banerjee in N. I. A. Vol. VI. pp. 97-102. A comparison of the works of the same name by Bhavadeva and Sulapiņi would be interesting but reasons of space prevent any such attempt. It is a misnomer to speak of the small treatises of Silapāņi as granthas or nibandhas. It is cumbersome and unnecessary to mention and describe all the writings of Sulapāņi (in a work like the present general History of Dharmaśāstra ) said to be 23 by Dr. S. C. Banerjee in N. I. A. vol. V. pp. 169-176. 
For the Dolayâtràviveka one has to turn to the volume of studies presented to the present author on his completing 60 years on the 7th May 1941, to which Dr. S. C. Banerji contributed a paper containing the text of Dolayātráviveka of Sūlapāņi (pp. 56-62 ) based on seven mss. belonging to the Dacca University mss, library. It is a small tract of about five printed pages (if the footnotes about different readings of the mss. be excluded ). Dolayātrā means the festival of swinging (of the image of Krsna ). Half of the work is taken from Skandapurāņa, some verses are also quoted from the Brabmapuràņa and Devipurāņa and the work called Bhujabalabhima is also cited. The festival may be celebrated for three days or five days. Ordinarily it is celebrated on the full moon day of Phàlguna (but questions arise when Paurnimă is mixed with Caturdaši) or with Uttaraphålguni naksatra. The conclusions are stated in the note below1250 when one or two of the three required particulars are wanting. 
A few words are required to be said on the two extensive and important works of Śülapāni, viz. Prayascittaviveka and Sraddhaviveka. But the Sraddhaviveka not being available to me in Devanāgari script, I have had to give up the idea of say, ing something about it. The first was printed over seventy years ago by Jivananda with the commentary of Govindånanda called

It is difficult to believe that all these (or even large portions ) were actually practised by the people in the author's days or even centuries before him. A brief statement of its contents is given here.— Etymology1981 of the word Prayascitta according to Angiras and Harita ; how sins are incurred ( acc. to Manu XI. 43, Yaj. III. 219-220); the effect of sins are experienced in the present life itself or in another life (Yaj. III. 32-33 ); sinners fall into hell or are born with bodily defects (Manu XI. 49, 52); narakas (hells ) are many acc. to Manu IV. 88–90; two views -- one is that the results of every act must be endured and there is no escape from them; the other is that results of sins may be avoided or mitigated by appropriate acts and penances declared in the śástras ( Manu XI. 45, 46, 53 ); distinction between sins committed through ignorance and sins committed of set purpose ( Yaj. III. 226 ); sinner should approach a parişad (assembly of learned men) or the king; consti tution of parişad for prescribing appropriate penances (pp. 27-29); various methods for reducing or removing effects of sins (Manu XI. 227, 230 ); enumeration of penances like kịcchra, cândrāyana, prajāpatya, santapana, paraka; secret penances like japa of mantras and homas; nine kinds of sins, such as atipätaka, mabăpătaka, anupataka, upapataka, jätibhramsakara &c.; enumeration and definitions of these; acc. to Visņu (34. 1) there are three utipàtakas viz. incest with mother, daughter or daughter-in-law; Manu does not mention atipātakas as a distinct class; for Atipătakas, penance for these is entering into fire; Prayaścittas for the five Mahāpātakas (in Manu XI. 57); upapātakas are 38 in Manu (XI. 59-66); Jâti bhramsakara are sins mentioned in Manu XI. 67-70; penances for Mahàpatakas; no sin incurred when a bråhmaṇa who is being treated medically dies (Yaj. III. 284); Manu (VIII. 350-52) and many ancient sages very clearly accept the right of private

defence by stating that even if one's guru or a boy or an old man or a learned brāhmana approaches with a weapon to harm a person, the latter should kill him without further thought"268 ; penances for killing a brāhmaṇa ( 13 indicated by Manu XI. 72–82 as stated in the Pr. Viveka p. 65 ); but this applies only when killing is not of set purpose; P. ( stands for Prāyascitta or Prāyaścittas in this summary') for those who abet killing or who encourage or merely approve; P. are more severe according as the culprit in the case of killing a brāhmana is a Ksatriya or of another varna or even in other offences (than killing a brāhmara); Daksiņă in penances depends upon the means of the guilty person; penances for drinking surā ;1253 meaning of sură (Manu XI. 93 ), since all intoxicants are not regarded as sură (pp. 89 ff.); P. for theft of gold (pp. 107--127); 
1252 
Similar provisions occur in Matsya-purāṇa, chap. 227. 115-117 Prāyaścitta V. of Sūlapāpi (pp.59-60 ) quotes Manu VIII, 351. and remarks that the words Hanyád-eva' show that there is no alternative and the only action is to kill that brāhmaṇa offender (evahiro niya rithah ) and the Dandaviveka (p. 240) of Vardhamāna repeats these words of Sulapāpi. Vide an elaborate paper on 'Atatāyivadha' by Prof. Rangaswami Aiyanyar in C. K. Raja Felicitation volume pp. 197–232. The Chándogyopanişad ( V. 10. 9) enumerates the fire Maha pātakıs in the verse steno kiranyasya .... pañcamas-cācaca raistar-iti'. Manu IV. 162 and VIIT, 350 ( = Matsyapurāna 227. 115 ) appear to be inconsistent with each other. Therefore The Sar. V. p. 155 holds that the latter deals only with the punishment for) Atatāyi brāhmaṇay. Eien in the Rgveda (VII. 86.6) Vasiştha appears to plead with God Varupa that man commits sin under the influence of surī, wrath, gambling, thoughtiessness and in VIII. 2. 12 refers to brawls (or fights) arising among people intoxicated by surā. The Prāyaścitta V. (p. 89) quotes & Śruti Surà vai malam annānām' and adds 'yadyapi annusabdah....odane prasi ddhastathāpi ... pişta-yavágvādivikāramapi lakṣayati tenā nnavıkāraviệeşo madahetuh suretyu yate' and cites Manu XI. 93 Surā vai malai annānāin dc,' and then quotes two verses of Pulastya, in which eleven kiods of iutoxicating drinks are specified as varieties of marlyn, are distinguished from sură and it is expressly provided that all hiuds of mariya are not

A few of the original basic texts ( not many in number ), that were full of differences of opinion among the sages and had to be reconciled or explained away somehow, may be cited here in the original. Many of the medieval writers cite them and seek to bring order out of them. तस्मा समानादेव पुरुषदत्ता चाद्यश्च जायत इदं हि चतुर्थे पुरुषे तृतीये संगच्छामहे इति वि देवं दीव्यमाना जात्या आसने एतम्मादु तत् । शतपथ ब्रा.

pp. 117-118 about the meaning of the word Mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of persons carried away by Mlecchas or robbers and made to eat forbidden things and to do dirty jobs as slaves. The Prāyaścittaviveka of Sülapāni (pp. 455-456 ) quotes verses ( 17-22 ) of Devala ( that occur in the collection of Smrtis of the Anan. Press). Devala was liberal enough to prescribe that hy proper prāyaścittas & person carried away hy inleechas and made to eat even condemned flesh and to live like one of them may be taken back in the Hindu fold within four years and that after four years he becomes assimilated to the Allecchas, has to die as a mleccha and thus death frees hin from the taint. It is very creditable to Sūlapāņi that he quotes these verses of Devala, that he accepts them in toto and does not try to treat them as not applical;le in his days or explain them away in some other way.

silver māsaka (p. 522 ); Prājāpatyavrata held equal to the gift of a cow yielding milk (pp. 525, 528-29 ) or its price; Gautama dharmasutra ( 19. 11-18 ) prescribed various optional prayascittas (for purification ) viz. Japa (of sacred texts ), tapas, homa, fast and gifts and among gifts of cows also there were certain options (Pr. Viveka pp. 530-534 quoting Manu XI. 127–130, Yāj. III. 266-67); P. for twelve years may be held equal to donating 180 cows yielding milk (p. 538); on p. 538 Parāka is held equal to gift of five milk-yielding cows1258 and these equations are mainly based on the dicta of authoritative texts (pp. 539-40 ) and Sūlapāņi discusses here and there the reasonableness of these equations (on pp. 538-544). 
The Prāyaścittaviveka is very often referred to by Raghu nandana in his Smstitattva. Vide (vol. 1.) Tithi pp. 28, 90 (Prāyāścittavi vekakstām mate tu); Ahnika pp. 341, 350; Prayas citta 467, 470, 472, 477, 481 (criticised ), 485, 513, 517 tac-cin tyam ); Vol. Il-Ekādasi p. 8, 15, (Prāyascittavivekakrdbhih); Udvaha p. 112, Dāyatattva p. 182; Suddhi p. 283. The Sraddha viveka is also frequently mentioned, e. g. (vol. I) Tithi pp. 12, 18, 154; Śrăddha pp. 190, 194, 206, 223, 271, 290; Prāyaścitta p. 471, Malao pp. 769, 801, 850 (plural kļdbhiḥ' used ); vol. II. Ekadasi pp. 85, 179; Suddhi p. 377. It appears, from the fact that the honorific plural is used by Raghunandana when referring to the author, that Sulapāņi was alive or recently dead when Raghunandana began to collect material for his work. 
Among the authors and works (omitting Dharmasútras, Smrtis and their authors ) the following may be cited as men tioned by Sūlapāņi in Prayascittaviveka : Kapardibhāşya (p. 536); Kalpataru ( several times as on pp. 104, 144, 149, 155, 178, 180, 359, 364); Govindaraja (p 91); Jikana (about 18 times as on pp.19, 50, 86, 94, 97 &c. ), Dharmapradipa ( about a dozen times pp. 209, 257, 281, 335, 347, 366, 379, 401, 442, 446, 477, 526 ( those under lined dissented from ); Dhūreśvara (p. 61, same as Bhojadeva); Bālaka (pp. 43, 55, 93, 125, 131 on gurvanganā ), pp. 149, 146, 364 
1259 
It may be noted that from p. 522 to p. 514 Sūlapāņi deals with establishing equivalences among certain vrata: (or Prāyaścittas ) inter se and also equivalence of some vratas with gifts of milk-yielding cows in certain numbers.

(dissented from); Bhartryajña (p. 254), Rājan (Bhojadeva) 150,152, 157; Lakşmidhara 319, Višvarūpa 91, 119; Śrikara 66 (dissented from ); M. M. Chakravarti (JASB. 1911, p. 339) does not mention Kapardibhāsya and Bhartsyajña. On pp. 98, 139, 536-37 Śūlapāņi refers to Mahadevapada and on p. 118 Srimaheśvara, all referring to God Siva as the interlocutor in the Bhavisya Purāņa. 
The chronological relation between Salapāņi and Vācaspati mišra appears to be this that Sūlapāņi was the older of the two, though they appear to refer to each other. For example, the Dvaitanirnaya of Vacaspati (p. 102 in the Sástramālà Series of Benares ) mentions Sraddhavivekamata. On the other hand, in the Rasayātrāviveka (which appears to be his last work) Sūlàpani mentions the Tirtha-cintămani of Vacaspatimisra.1260 
At least thirteen Vivekas are known viz. Ekidasi, Tithi, Dattaka, Durgotsava, Dolayātrà, Pratisthà, Prayascitta, Rāsa yátra, Vratakála, Suddhi, Sraddha, Sankranti, Sambandha. The Vratakālaviveka is published by Prof. S. C. Banerji in I. H. Q. Vol. 17 for 1941 ( appendix pp. 1-24, based on seven mss.). It mentions the Tithiviveka as already composed (p. 11) and also Pratișthàviveka (p. 24). He makes remarks on Vratas in general and then deals with individual vratas. It differs from the Vratatattva of Raghunandana (vol. 11. pp. 151–161 ) in that Raghunandana deals with the characteristics and rites of Vratas in general. For a short work (as the Vratakālaviveka is) Śülapāņi mentions a large number of authorities; many Purānas are relied upon as much as Smộti works and writers. 
The Tithiviveka1261 of Śūlapāņi was edited by Prof. of S. C. Banerji in P. O. Vol. VI. pp. 230-38, Vol. VII. pp. 8, 95-103. It is very brief, the text based on two mss. covering about 12 pages. It mentions that the Sraddhaviveka had been written before it. The object is to resolve the doubts caused by differ ent views in the authoritative works. Relying on two verses

of Devala (quoted below )1262 he appears to lay down the propo sitions that in a rite to be performed for worship of gods, find out whether the tithi required exists at sunrise (and it does not matter if it does not exist later ) and in rites in honour of pitss (manes ) find out the tithi that exists at sunset and per form the rite on it. Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri edited the Tithi viveka (Calcutta 1964) with the commentary called Tātparya dipikā by Srinātha-ācārya-cúdāmaņi, son of mahamahopādhyāya Srikara and guru of Raghunandana Bhattăcārya. 
A work called Caturangadipika’ (manual of fourhanded chess ) composed by Salapīni was edited by Mr. Mano Mohan Ghosh in 1936 with an Introduction, Sanskrit text (pp. 1-24), English tr. (32 pages ), Index of important words, proper names and general index (pp. 33-36). It is mentioned by Raghu nandana in (vol. I.) Tithitattva pp. 137-139. Vide Prof. S. K. Chatterji felicitation volume pp. 267-275 for Lexicographical notes on this work by Prof. E. D. Kulkarni. 
Four works of Sūlapāņi are very famous viz. the Dipakalika, Prāyaścittaviveka, Durgotsavaviveka and the Srăddhaviveka. Unfortunately the last two works are not yet printed in Deva nāgari script. The Durgotsavaviveka has been published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parişad of Calcutta in Bengali script and the Sraddhaviveka has similarly been published in the Bengali script by M. M. Candicarana Smistibhūsaņa of Calcutta. 
Śūlapāņi is mentioned with great respect by Raghunandana not only by the addition of titles like Mahamahopadhyāya but by referring to him in the plural as in (vol. I. Tithi p. 90, Prayas cittavivekakstām mate tu ) and in Vol. II. Ekadasi p. 15 (Prayas cittavivekakļdbhir-uktam ). 
Sūlapāņi gives hardly any information about himself.1283 In the colophons of his works he is styled Mahamahopadhyaya 
1262 The two verses of Devala are : fi fatü fa914 3G* HIT

and also Sāhudiyān or Sähudiyala or Sàhudiyà (in a ms. of the Dipakalikā). What this last means is not clear. It is possible that he came from some place called Sàhudi. There is hardly any reliable evidence to establish that the Sahudiya was a degraded section of the Radhiya brāhmaṇas in Bengal from the time of Ballalasena. I understand from Bengali friends that in these days also the surname Sāhudiyān is extant among the śrotriya brāhmaṇas of the Ràdbiya group in Bengal. Raghunandana (a great Bengali writer ) often refers to im as Mahamahopadhyaya ( vide pp. 827-28 above ). 
There are several commentaries on the Sraddhaviveka such as those of (1) Srinātha-Åcăryacūdamani, son of Śrikara and Guru of Raghunandana; (2) Acyuta Cakravartin ; (3) Govinda nanda; (4) Śrikrýņa (printed in Bengali type); (5) Nila kantha; (6) Jagadisa; (7) Ramakrsna. Some commentaries on the Prayascittaviveka also exist. Besides, the Tattavārtha kaumudi of Govindananda ( already referred to on p. 828 ) there is a commentary called Kaumudi or tippani by Rama krsna and another com. called Nigūdhārthaprakāśikā. 
As Sūlapāņi names the Ratnakara of Candeśvara and Kala madhaviya, he must be later than about 1365 A. D., since some time must have elapsed before a work from Vijayanagara came to be regarded as an authority in Bengal. As Sulapāņi's works 
(Continued from the previous page) Srinātha-Acāryacūdāmaņi appears to be mentioned as Acar yacūlāmani along with other authors by Raghupandana in Vol. II. Yajurvedarşotsargatattva p. 640. Raghunandana refers to his guru's views under the caption guru-carapāh' in a few places e. . vol. I. ( Tithi pp. 31, 85, Mala. p. 719. 815, Sariskāra p. 873 ); vol.

Rai Babadur Chakravarti furnishes a good account about his com mentaries and works in J. A. S. B. ( new series) Vol. XI. pp. 344-349. Śrinātha wrote two works on Śrāddha viz. Śrāddhacandrikā (Smộtitattva, Vol. II. pp. 493 and 500) and Śrāddhadīpikā (Suartitattva, Vol. II. p. 488).

are mentioned by Rudradhara, Govindānanda and Vacaspati, the former must be earlier than about 1460. In this connection it has to be noted that Govindananda not only comments upon Śülapāņi's works but probably looks upon Sulapāņi as an old writer along with Aniruddha,1263 
A ms. of the Prayascittaviveka was copied at Benares in sake 1410 (i. e. 1481 A. D. ).1264 Ms. No. 10849 of the Prayascitta viveka in the Baroda Oriental Institute's Library was copied in Vikrama year 1501 Magha (i. e. about February 1445 A. D.). The post-colophon entry in that ms. is set out below.1265 From all these data it follows that Sūlapāņi flourished between 1365 and 1445 A. D. 
Dr. Hazra in A. B. O. R. I. Vol. 32 (for 1951 ) in note on p. 46 says that Salapāņi's Tithiviveka and Sraddhaviveka are mentioned by Räyamukuța in the Smộtiratnahāra which was composed before Rāyamukuta's commentary on the Amarakośa and that commentary was begun in 1431–32 A. D. But in I. H. Q. vol. 17 (pp. 456-471) it is pointed out by Prof. Dineshcandra Bhattacharya at p. 468 that the Țikä on the Amarakośa was composed in Sake 1396 i. e. 1447–75 A. D. and not in sake 1353 (which was mentioned incidentally in the ms. and was taken by Colebrooke and later scholars as the date of composition). Further contributions on the same subject appear in I. H. Q. vol. 18. pp. 215-224 against Prof. Bhattacharya, to which the latter replies in I. H. Q. vol. 19 pp. 182-190, to which Ahmed Hasan (the writer of the paper in I. H. Q. vol. 18 ) gives a rejoinder in I. H. Q. vol, 30 pp. 261-270. I cannot go here in these controversies. It has to be remembered that the fragment of Smstiratnākara refers to the Sraddhaviveka about three dozen of times. I agree with Prof. Bhattacharya's view. So even the dates proposed in the first edition (1375–1460

A. D.) for Salapāņi were not altogether wide of the real date, In this edition an attempt has been made to advance somewhat more definite dates for Śülapāņi, that is all. 
It appears that Śūlapāņi, Rudradhara and Vācaspati were more or less contemporaries of one another. Rudradhara men tions on p. 50 ( of his Śräddhaviveka ) Gaudiya-Sraddhaviveka'. 
99. Rudradhara 
This is a well-known Maithila writer on Dharmasastra, who composed several works. His Suddhi-viveka has been published several times (at Benares in 1866, in 1878, and by the Venkateśvara Press in Bombay, samvat 1978). That work is divided into three paricchedas and deals with purification from impurity on birth and death, the persons liable to undergo purifications, the mean ing of the word putra, purification of the body and of various substances when polluted, purification of cooked food and water and women in their menses. He tells us that after1266 having examined seven works ( nibandhas) on suddhi and being encoura ged by his father and brother he composed the Suddhiviveka. He further says that he made the effort for the benefit of those who were not disposed to go through such works as the Ratnakara, Pārijāta, Mitākşarà and the Hăralatā.1267 Besides these he mentions the Acaràdarśa, Suddhipradipa, Suddhi-bimba, Sridattopadhyāya, Smrtisára and Harihara, 
The śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara is the most famous of his works. (It was printed in the ashi Sanskrit Series in samvat 1993 ( i. e. 1936-7 A. D.) and the page references are made to that edition ). The work is divided into four paricchedas. He first defines śrāddha, and then treats of several topics, viz. the varieties of sraddha, the procedure at śrāddhas, the mantras that are recited, the proper time and place for śräddhas, the Brāhmanas worthy to be invited at śrāddha and the proper food etc. Among the numerous works and authors referred to in the work the

undermentioned ones deserve notice. 1268 He refers to his own Suddhiviveka as already written (p. 48). Several Purānas are mentioned such as the Devipurāna (pp. 14–15, 32), Brahma purāņa ( several times and 7 verses from it are quoted on p. 33), Matsyapurana (p. 37 five verses quoted ), Vayu (p. 37). 
In several places he tells us that ne follows a different tradition on certain matters from that of the Pitrbhakti or of the Sugatisopāna. He points out that the prasātikā is a kind of grain known in Madhyadeśa as sāthilā.1268 
For his Vratapaddhati, ride Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 15, No. 1995. He says that he was urged by his brother's advice to write the work and that he foilows the Samayapradipa. 1270 From the colophon to the suddhiviveka it appears that Rudra dhara's father's name was Lakşmidhara and his elder brother's name was Haladhara. 
Another work of his is the Varsakstya which deals with festivals and fasts. 
He was the son of Mahamahopadhyāya Laksmidhara and youngest brother of Haladhara. His works are quoted by

History of Dharmaśāstra Vacaspati in his Dvaitayanirnaya, by Govindananda in the Sraddha kriyakaumudi, by Raghunandana ( as in vol. I, Tithitattva pp. 136, 137, 186, Śrāddhatattva p. 226, Prāyaścitta p. 542; vol. II. Śuddhi tattva pp. 265, 272), in several of his tattvas, by Kamalakara and Nilakantha. 
As Rudradhara mentions the Ratnakara, the Smstisára, Śridattopadhyāya and the Sraddhaviveka of Sūlapāņi, he is certainly later than 1425 A. D. A ms. of his Vratapaddhati is dated in Laksmana samvat 344 i. e. 1463 A. D.1271 Besides he is quoted by Vacaspati and Govindānanda. Therefore he must have flourished between 1425 and 1460 A, D. 
Raghunandana several times mentions Rudradhara in his Smstitattva viz. (in vol. I), Tithi pp. 136-137 (on Kojā gara Paurņimă ), p. 186 ( Kuberapůjā ), Sraddha p. 226, Prayas. p. 542; (in vol. II ) Suddhi pp. 265 (criticized ), 272, 471. Vide M. M. Chakravarti in JASB vol. XI (1915) pp. 404-405 for some information on Rudradhara. 
The Rudradhara who was a pupil of Candeśvara and author of the Kętyacandrikā, the Vivădacandrika and the Sraddha candrikā appears to be a different author. 
100. Misarumiśra 
Misarumiśra is famous for his works called Vivādacandra and Padártha-candrikā (on the Nyāya-Vaiseșika system ). There is a ms, of the Vivādacandra in the Deccan College (No. 57 of 1883-84). That work deals with the titles of Law (vyavahāra padas ) such as ļņādāna (recovery of debt), nyāsa (deposit), asvảmivikraya, sambhůya-samutthana (partnership), dàyavibhāga, stridhana; and then with procedure, viz. the plaint, reply, pramānas, witnesses, possession etc. It frequently quotes the Ratnākara ( on vivāda and vyavahāra ) of Candeśvara and several times criticizes him. Besides numerous smộti writers the other authors and works named are : Parijāta, Prakāśa, Bălarüpa (often ), Bhavadeva and Smstisāra ( frequently ).

Nepal mss. XIII and p. 73. 
100. Misarumisra 
843 
In the mss, and colophons the name of the author seems to be Misarūmiśra.1972 He tells us that he wrote the work under the orders of princess Lachimadevi, wife of prince Candrasimha who appears to have been the younger brother of Bhairavasimhadeva of the Kāmeśvara dynasty of Mithilà. The work was probably called Vivādacandra to connect it with the prince Candrasimha. The Vivădacandra first1273 speaks of king Bhavesa of the Käme svara dynasty, then of his son Harişimhadeva, then of his son Darpanārāyana and the latter's queen Hirà or Dhira and then of Candrasimha and his queen Lakhimă or Lachimà. We saw above that Candeśvara who had weighed himself against gold in 1314 A. D. wrote in his old age under Bhavesa his work on Rājaniti. Lachimadevi was queen of the great-grandson of this Bhaveśa, who became king of Tirhut in the third quarter of the 14th century. Therefore Candrasiṁha must have flourished about the middle of the 15th century and Misarumiśra's work must be assigned to that period. M. M. Chakravarti points out (JASB for 1915, p. 425) that for Dhirasimha, a son of Darpanārāyaṇa, there is an authentic date, viz, 321 of the Lakṣmaṇasena era in Tirhut (i. e. 1438 A. D. ), when a ms. of Srinivasa's Setudarpaņi (com. on Setubandha) was copied during Dhirasimha's reign. It appears that Misarumiśra was closely related to Lakhimădevi, who was the daughter of Misarumisra's sister, 
That the Vivādacandra is a work of authority on Hindu Law in Mithilā has been recognised from very early days in the British courts,1274 The Vivādacandra held that the word stridhana was to be applied to such woman's property as was technically

101. Vācaspatimiśra 
Vacaspatimiśra is the foremost nibandha writer on Smộti in Mithilă. His Vivadacintamani had been recognised by the High Courts in India and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a work of paramount authority on matters of Hindu Law in Mithila. 278 His literary activity was closely connected with the reigns of two kings of Mithilā, viz. Bhairavendra or Bhairavasimha ( also styled Harinārāyana ) and his son Rāma bhadra (called also Rūpanårāyana ), both of the Kameśvara dynasty. Vacaspati was an extremely voluminous writer and appears to have composed dozens of works. In the Sraddhakapla alias Pitsbhakti-taraigini, almost his latest work, he says that he wrote in his youth ten works on sastra and thirty nibandhas on smīti and composed the work in question in his declining years.1277 At least eleven works of his bearing the title 'cintā maņi' are known. They are briefly noticed below.

Dr. Rocher (in Preface to Vyavahāracintāmaņi (pp. 8–11 ) brings together all works ascribed to Vācaspatimiśra and points out how doubts bave been entertained about authorship of some of them. It is not necessary por possible (for reasons of space) to go into the question of the authorship of some of the works brought toge ther by him. One instance may soifice to show the difficulties of the task, M.M. Chakravarti lield in JASB ( vol. XI N. S. for 1915 p. 398 ) that the work called Candana-dhenu-pramāņa was a work of Vācaspati-mijra, but Prof. D. C. Bhattacharya holds in vol. IV. of J.G.J. R. I. (pp. 295–312 ) that it is a work of another Vācaspati (i, e, of Candrasekhara Smrti

The Ähnikacintamani is quoted in his Suddhicintamani. The Kệtyacintamani was published in Bengali characters at Benares in sake 1814 ( vide JASB. for 1915, p. 395 ) and deals with the festivals that are celebrated on different days in the year. The Tirthacintāmaņi has been published in the B. I. Series. It is divided into five prahāśas, viz. Prayaga, Purusottama (Puri), Ganga, Gay, and Vārāṇasi and deals with such topics as the purpose of pilgrimages, the preliminaries of pilgrimage, the various rites to be performed at the several tirthas, the subsidiary sacred places at the principal tirthas etc. He mentions the Kalpataru, Ganeśvaramišra, Jayasarmà, the Mitākşară, Smsti samuccaya and Hemadri. In the introduction he explicitly states that he composed the work after carefully examining the Kệtyakalpadruma and Pārijāta, the Ratnākara and other works, 1279 The Dvaitacintánani is mentioned in his Kệtyacintamani. The Niticintamani is mentioned in the Vivadacintamani (p. 72). The Vivādacintamani (texi ) was published at Calcutta in 1837 (which edition is used in this work) and was translated into English by Prasannakumar Tagore (in 1863 ) with a learned preface. A translation into English of the Vivādacintamani made by Dr. Ganganath Jha, with an Introduction by Dr. Umesha Mishra, was published in the Gaikwad's Oriental Series (Baroda ) in 1942. The Vivādacintamani was elaborately examined by the Patna High Court in I. L. R. 12 Patna 359-616 at pp. 420-538 which examined passages of the Vivādacintāmani (from two editions of that work viz. one published in 1837 and another published by the Venkateshwar Press, Bombay in 1898). It explicitly states that the author carefully studied the Kstyakalpa druma. Pārijāta and Ratnakara.!2$0 The work deals exhaustively with the eighteen titles of law ( vravahārapadas ).

mentioned in the work are noted below.1281 In this work he mentions several vernacular equivalents for Sanskrit terms. The Vyavahāracintămani1282 deals with judicial procedure, viz. the four principal topics thereof, viz. bhāsā (the plaint), uttara (reply of defendant ), kriyà ( evidence), nirnaya ( decision ). An excellent edition of the Vyavahäracintāmaņi was published at Ghent in 1956 by Dr. Ludo Rocher, based on seven mss., with an English translation and several appendices giving the first words of the verses ( quoted ), the authors quoted or referred to, the passages where the Vyavahāra-cintamani has been expressly referred to and a glossary of technical terms. The Suddhicintā. màpi was printed at Benares in Bengali characters in śake 1814 (JASB for 1915. p. 396 n 2). The Sudrācăracintamaņi deals with the duties of sūdras (Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 22, No. 2001). The Sraddhacintāmapi is a standard work and was printed at Benares in Bengali characters in sake 1814. The Vivada-cintàmaņi (p. 151, ed. of 1837) states that all persons that are sonless have been dealt with at length in Sräddha-c, and are therefore not dealt with by him in Vivàda-c.

Besides the works and authors enumerated in the foot-note above, the others mentioned by him in his several Cintamanis are noted below.1283 
Besides these there is a group of Vacaspati's works with the title 'Nirņaya’ on Tithi, Dvaita, Mahādāna, Vivada, Suddhi and some miscellaneous works under the headings 'Mahārņava'; only one of which viz. Kļiyan:ahārnava was a large one, the rest being small; vide M. M. Chakravarti in JASB vol. XI (1915) pp. 398– 99. The Tithinirņaya1284 starts with an invocation of the highest Being (paramātman) while most of his works are begun with an obeisance to Hari or Krşna. It first divides tithis into śuddha and viddhà (commingled with another tithi) and then discusses all the tithis from the first to the fifteenth and also amāvāsya; it deals with the questions as to the sites of that tithi which is k saya, with sivaràtrivrata, naktavrata, holidays, fasts, jayantivrata, holikā festival etc. 
The Dvaitanirnava of Vacaspatimiśra is one of his famous works. It has been published in the Sāstramàlā Series of Benares in the year 1994 of Vikrama era (i. e. 1937–38 A. D.) and contains 105 closely printed pages. Its very name suggests that it states definite conclusions on some matters of Dharmaśāstra on which there are differences of opinion. There are twelve introductory verses. The first verse praises Kęsna and identifies him with brahman. Verses 2-6 praise King Bhairavendra of Mithila and his queen Jayā who was the mother of king Purusottama, state that she assigned this task to him (v. 7) and verses 8-10 praise her as having dedicated many parks, got many

reservoirs of water to be dug and made munificent gifts. For a work of 105 pages, it quotes numerous authors and works. It is impossible to convey in a few words its method of dealing with points of difference discussed by it. Two easy examples may be cited. A text says about naming a child (namakarana ) 'the father should on the 11th or 12th day give a name to the child'. This does not mean that there is an option, viz. that the father may choose at his sweet will any of the two days. An option like this is liable to have eight faults, accordingto mimāṁsā rules ( for which see H. of Dh. vol. V. pp. 1250–52). The real meaning is that nāmakaraṇa should be done as a rule on the 11th day after birth, but if that is impossible for some reason, then it should be done on the 12th day after birth. Most of the differences relate to religious rites. An instance of an ordinary transaction may be cited here. Manu (VIII, 151 ) states that when money is lent at interest the lender cannot recover more than double of what is lent when he demands the sum lent and the interest thereon at one time, but in VIII. 142 Manu says that the lender may take as interest on money fent at 2, 3, 4 or 5 per cent per month according to the varņa of the borrower. The conclusion is that is interest is demanded only once it cannot exceed the damdupat rule but if interest is taken month by month, the total interest received may be so much that the lender may have received in all much more than double the amount. 
It resers on p. 6 to this work Sabdanirņaya on p. 17 and p. 98 to his Mhädānanirnaya and on p. 49 to his Śrāddha cintāmaņi.

For a detailed treatment of the Mahādanas based on the Puräņas vide the author's H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 869-877, where it is shown that Tulăpuruşa ( weighing a person against gold or silver and donating the metals to worthy brāhmaṇas ) is the first. The Mahadànanirraya1286 expatiates on the sixteen munificent gifts such as weighing against gold and silver. In the introductory verses Vācaspati gives the genealogy of his patron's family from Bhaveśa, whose son was Harasimhadeva, whose son was Narasimha, whose son Bhairavendra bore the biruda ( appel lation ) Harinārāyaṇa. A verse1287 at the beginning and one at the end attribute the work to Bhairavendra and to Rūpanārāyana respectively. Rupa-Dārāyana was the biruda of Rāmabhadra, a son of Bhairavendra. Therefore it looks probable that the work was commenced in the reign of Bhairava and was completed in the reign of his son Rāmabhadra. The Maha dànanirnaya of Vācaspati is expressly named in (vol, I ), Tithi tattva p. 99, in Ahnika p. 420 and in (vol. II ) Suddhi, p. 241. M. M. Chakravarti says that Bhairava himself bore at one time the biruda Rūpanārāyana. M. M. Haraprasad Sastri (Nepal Cat. p. 90) mentions a Vivådanirnaya of Vācaspati.

Suddhicintamani published at Benares in Bengali characters over seventy years ago ends with the words "Suddhinirnaya ucyate'. The Suddhinirnaya of Vacaspati deals with impurity, on birth and death, the religious acts that must be performed even in times of impurity, sapinda relationship, periods of impurity for the prin cipal varnas and mixed castes; periods of impurity on abortion, the deaths of infants and women, accidental deaths etc., overlapping of several periods of aśauca; impurity arising from carrying a corpse; rites after the death of a samyäsin; impurity from contact of lower castes, such as washermen and cāņdālás, freedom from impurity at tirthas and marriages etc. 
It may be noticed that many of his works run in pairs e. g. Dvaita-cio. and Dvaitanirnaya, Suddhi-cio and Suddhi-ni“. Vivada-cio and Vivāda-ni'. Why it was necessary to do so is not clear. 
Besides these, Vācaspati appears to have either composed or contemplated writing seven works called Mahārnava on krtya, acara, vivāda, vyavabāra, dāna, suddhi and pitsyajña. Of these the Krtyamabărņava is found and deals with festivals and fasts and the proper times therefor (vide JASB for 1915, p. 398 ). The Kītyanahārņava is mentioned by Raghu' in (vol. I) Tithi pp. 82, 103 and in (vol. II ) Ekadasi pp. 17, 46. He also wrote the Gayāsiāddhapaddhati, and the Dattakavidhi. Probably his last work, as stated above, was the Sraddhakalpa alias Pit;bhakti taraógini. 
Apart from the works on dharmaśāstra, Vācaspati wrote also on the systems of philosophy. But those interested may refer to P.of. Dineshcandra Bhattacharya's paper on Vàcas patimisra's Nyāya Werks' in vol. 4 of J. G. J. R. I. pp. 294-312. But it is not necessary for our purpose to go into that question. 
Many of the works of Vācaspati are mentioned by Raghunan dana in his Tattvas. The Acāra-C. is mentioned in (Vol. I) Tithi p. 24, Åhnika 207 and in ( vol. II ) Matha (616); Āhnika-C. is mentioned in vol. I, Áhnika 357, (vol. II ) Ekadasi 58 ( on 36 upacaras in devapijā); Kệtya-C. ( in vol.

Vācaspati vouchsafes very little information about himself or his family. In the colophons of his works he is generally styled mahamahopadhyava and misra or sanmisra. In the colophon of the Sūdrācāra-cintamaņi1288 he is described as the pari sad ( the adviser of the king in finally deciding difficult points of Dharma śāstra) of Mahārājadhiraja Harinārāyaṇa. We saw above that his Mahadānanirnaya connects itself with two kings Bhairava and his son Rupanārāyana. At the end of the Sraddhakalpa we are told that Vācaspati who was the parişad of Ramabhadradeva alias Rūpanāråyaņa, son of Harinārāyaṇa, composed the work at

flafo au faifa: Tranfeathfor: &c. Mitra's Notices, vol. VI. p. 22 No. 2001. In the Pitřbhakti-tarangiņi (also called Śräddhakalpa) also he is styled Parişad of king Rāmabhadra, Dr. S. C. Banerji states (in I. H. Q. Vol. 32 for 1956 pp. 386-392 ) that he found a single ms, of Sambandha-cintamani with a Pandit in East Bengal ( the ms, being corrupt in some portions ). It begins with the verse of Manu (I11. 5, asapi nilā ca. ), cites Yāj. I. 52 and Manu. V. 60 and other passages useally quoted in treatises on “Sambandba". It is incom. plete and is ascribed to Vācaspati at the end. It contains only 4} pages in print. I am not inclined to accept it as a work of the great Maithila writer and I think it is possible, that somebody copying from others or trying his band at writiog & tractate on Sambandha, wanted to pass it off as Vācaspati's,

the bidding of his patron.1288 Varadhamāna in his Daņdaviveka says that one of his gurus was Vacaspati.1290 It is probable that it is this Vācaspati that is meant. But as against this we must remember that Vacaspati in his Sraddhakalpa quotes Vardhamana Upadhyāya on śrāddha. Vardhamāna wrote his Dandaviveka while king Bhairava was reigning and his Garga krtyaviveka for Rāmabhadradeva. So Vacaspati was an elder contemporary of Vardhamana. 
Prasannakumar Tagore assigned 1423 A. D. as the time of the Vivādacintamani (vide preface p. xxVIII). Ghose in his 
Hindu Law (vol. II. p. XIV ) says that Vacaspati wrote the Srāddhacintamani by order of queen Jayà, widow of king Bhaira vadeva and mother of Purusottamadeva, 1281 that Harinārāyaṇa

(i. e. Bhairava) ruled from 1513 to 1527 and that the latter was killed by Nasratshah, the Pathan king of Bengal. M. M. Chakravarti holds that the literary activity of Vacaspati lay between 1450 to 1480 A. D. (Vide JASB Vol. XI (N. S.) for 1915 on p. 400 ). Since Vacaspati mentions the Ratnākara (of Candeśvara) and Rudradhara as his authorities he must be later than about 1425 A. D. Vacaspati's works are quoted by Govinda nanda and Raghunandana. Therefore Vacaspati is certainly earlier than 1540 A. D. The ms, of the Mabādānanirpaya found in Nepal is dated in 392 of the Lakşmanasena era ( Monday of Vaišākha, dark half, 12th tithi i. e. 22nd April 1511 A. D. ). The ms. of the Suddhinirnaya (Mitra's Notices vol. X. p. 58, No. 3308 ) was copied in saivat 1416, which must in this parti cular case, be taken as equivalent to sake 1416 i. e. 1494-95 A. D., since Vācaspati could not have flourished about 1360 A. D. (which corresponds to Vikrama suinvat 1416). Hence the period assigned by Chakravarti for the literary activity of Vaca spati appears to be correct. That date is further corroborated by the fact that Vācaspati wrote under Bhairavendra and his son Råmabhadradeva, that were 4th and 5th in descent from king Bhavesa of Mithilà, who, as we saw above, began to rule over Mithilă in the third quarter of the 14th century. Vide M. M. Chakravarti in JASB Vol. XI (New Series ) pp. 394-400 for information on Vācaspati. 
This Vacaspati, who flourished in Mithilā in the latter half of the fifteenth century, is very often confounded with other authors bearing the same name. The great philosopher Vacaspati, who was author of the Bhāmati on the Särirakabhāsya of Sankara and of several other commentaries on other systems of philosophy, flourished in the first half of the 9th century as he wrote his Nyāyasücinibandha in 898 (most probably of the Vikrama era ).1292 There was another (Candrasekhara) Vācaspati who wrote the Smstisārasaṁgraha (Cat. of Calcutta San. College mss. vol. II, p. 181, No. 203) and flourished in the first half of the 18th century. 
Raghunandana, the foremost medieval Nibandhakara of Bengal on Dharmaśāstra is conspicuous for his strong and frequent

History of Dharmaśāstra 
criticism of Vācaspati and Maithila writers. He often discusses the views of Vācaspati and in a large number of cases states that what Vacaspati says should be given up or not followed (heyam) or that what Vācaspati says has been rejected or shown to be wrong ( nirastam ). The present author will first mention a large number of cases by references to the pages of the Smstitattva of Raghu. where those words (heyam) or 'nirastam' or 
apāstam' are used about Vacaspati. (A) Important cases where the words 'heyam or nirastam' have been used are: (vol. I). Tithi p. 20; Sraddha 224, 258, 275, 289, 294; Malamāsa 790, 794, 799, 816, 829, 854; (vol. II ) Suddhi 292, 306; Yajurvedi-Srāddha 502. Once the word ‘Pramāņa-śünyam' is used in vol. II Yajur vedišraddha p. 488. Sometimes the criticism is a little milder viz. when phrases like 'må evam' (in Tithi 20 or Srāddha 288 ) or 'tad-ayuktam' (Srāddha 290 ) are employed. The present author has not collected such cases. Then in many cases Raghu' lumps together Maithila writers on certain topics and remarks that their views are 'heya' or ' nirasta' or “apāsta', The words. Maithiloktam’ heyam or “nirastam') are also fre quently employed by Raghunandana. What authors are included in those words it is difficult to say. Capdesvara, Sridatta, Rudradhara, Misarumiśra and Vardhamana are all Maithila writers and there are several others less famous Mithilā writers. 
A few cases of the words. Maithiloktam heyam' or 'nirastam or 'apāstam’ are mentioned here; (in vol. I) Tithi 9, 168 (apăstam); Sraddha 207, 246, 274, 292 308 and 315 (nirastam ), 341; Malamāsa 804, (vol. II) Áuddhi pp. 316, 332 (Maithilânām Vākyaracanà heyā). The difficulty of modern readers is that most of the works of Vacaspatimiśra and Vardhamana are not yet available in print and they are not in a position to consider the fairness or otherwise of Raghu nandana's criticisms. The words generally used are either T fa font or simply fait or rarely refer to the name of the work (e. g. daraugliticias in Malamāsa. p. 794). 
102. Dandaviveka of Vardhamāna In the first edition of this History, Vardhamana was not dealt with, because none of his works was then available to me in print. His Dandaviveka was first published in 1931 in the Gaikwad Oriental Series (Buroda ) edited by Mahamahopā

dhyāya Kamalakrsna Smộtitirtha of Bhatpara in West Bengal with an exhaustive Introduction in English and a brief one in Sanskrit. 
The work deserves special mention in this history since it is probably the only extensive extant Sanskrit work (in 356 pages) on the law of crimes and punishments alone. 
Smstis like those of Manu and Yajñavalkya deal with crimes and punishments, but the treatment is brief and mixed up with other matters. For example, Manu VIII, 20 ( = Santiparva 15. 30 ) states that if the king were not vigilant in awarding punishment to those who deserve to be punished, the strong would devour the weak and further the king properly awarding punishments becomes endowed with the three goals of life viz. dharma, artha and kāina (Manu VII. 27, Santiparva 121. 10). Kautilya (in I. 4. 11-14) emphasizes the same things.1203 
1 
Separate works on Vivada (substantive law) and Vyava hāra (procedural law) were composed but those on Vyavahāra alone were few and far between viz. Vyavahāraratnākara of Candeśvara,1294 (vide Mitra's Notices, vol. VI p, 66 No. 2036 ) and Vyavahāra-Cintamani of Vacaspati ( published long ago and lately published by Dr. Rocher). Halàyudha also appears to have composed either a work dealing with both Vivāda and Vyavahara or two works dealing with the two branches of law separately. 
In dozens of places the Vivādaratnákara mentions Halā yudha's work and sometimes styles it · Hälayudha-nibandha' (as on pp. 41, 44 and 50 ). Halayudha appears to have also dealt with the procedural law and with crimes and punishments.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
Vardhamana in the Dandaviveka cites Halāyudha 33 times and sometime meotions his work Halàyudha-nibandha (as on pp. 72, 150, 275 ) and as Halāyudhiya (pp. 119. 152 ). 
The Dandaviveka is a large work in 355 printed pages. It starts with the eulogy of danda' contained in Manu VII. 14, 15, 17, 18, points out by quoting Manu VII. 20-21 that, if the king does not punish those who deserve punishment then what is called Mātsyanyāya will prevail. He further cites Manu VIII. 304 that the king shares one-sixth of the inerit (dharma) of his subjects when he properly regulates them and takes 1/6th of the sins of his subjects if he does not regulate them properly. He quotes Bșhaspati that Danda is of four levels viz. vāg-danda (i. e. censure by saying you did an improper act), dhig-danda ( censuring a guilty person in the words 'fie on you who are guilty of an unworthy act), dhanadanda (fine, either a fixed amount or a varying amount), vadha-danda (inflicting bodily pain, mutilation of a limb or limbs and death); the circumstances on which the punishment depends such as jāii (caste ), amount (of property ), age (childhood, grown up man), time of offence (day or night &c ). On pp. 22-30 he discusses at some length the fines in panas (lowest, middling, highest &c.) basing his remarks on Mauu VIII, 138 and Yāj. I. 366 and discusses the scale of the values of guñjā, kịşnala, mășa, suvarna (&c.) and of weights and measures called karśa, pala, tolaka &c. and coins of copper, silver and gold. He discusses at some length the parts of an offender's body that are to be dealt with by way of punish ment ( quoting Manu VIII. 124 ) and states different views about bodily punishments for a brāhmaṇa offender (pp. 46-48). He has a long disquisition on fines with reference to various crimes in pp. 52 ff. Manu (VIII. 336) provides that, where for an offence an ordinary person would be fined one Kārşāpaņa, a rajan (king )1295 should be fined one thousand panas. The Danda 
1295 
It may be noted here that comentators like Kullūka state that the king in such a case should himself lay down the fine and that he should distribute the fine among eminent vaidika brāhmaṇas or throw it into waters, since Varuņa is the lord of waters and of kings, is said by Danu ( IX. 245 ). Rgveda ( VII. 49. 3) states that Varuna is the lord of waters and

viveka explains that rajan' in this passage means only persons who are endowed with power (landlords &c.) and not the king himself. He quotes Manu VIII. 126 and Yāj. I. 368 and elaborates on them. He devotes pp. 88-140 to punishments for thefts of various kinds. He deals with adultery, rape and unnatural offences on pp. 54–195 and with defamation and cognate offences in pp. 196-218, with assault and battery in pp. 219-258, miscella neous (prakirnaka) matters which are taken up by the king him self and not brought before the king by any person (pp. 259 272); he devotes pp. 273-292 to the rules about property or treasure lost and found or buried treasure found. He has a special discussion (pp. 293-320) on sāhasa (of five kinds viz. killing a person, rabbery, carrying away a woman by force or rape and the two kinds of pārusya), special rules of punishment for Sudra guilty of certain acts such as those described in Manu VIII. 272, 281 (both verses occur in Narada also ), such as wear ing the sacred thread and thereby earning his livelihood or (Yaj. II. 304); cutting down trees growing near temples, burial places or on boundaries &c.; On pp. 325-33 he mentions the Vivada padas and details some punishments about some of them such as 'aşvāmi-vikraya' (Manu VIII. 197–198); pp. 331-337 deal with fines arising on breach of court's temporary orders in a proceeding such as temporary injunction not to leave one's place of residence or not to do certain acts, pp. 331-355 are concerned with fines for members of the court (sabhya) in certain cases, review of judgment, fines for parties attributing faults to good witnesses, fines for false witnesses, fines for witnesses found to be false on account of being bribed (Manu VIII. 120-121 ), fines for witnesses called upon to depose but not coming to do so without any reason &c. 
Vardhamåna gives about himself and his work some in formation. He wrote the Dandaviveka while king Bhairava was the ruler of Mithilā and states that his elder brother was Gandakamiśra and the latter along with Sankara and Vacaspati

were his gurus (Intro. Verse 6). At the end he says that he wrote the Dandaviveka for the sake of the king of Videha, that he was the son of Bhaveśa of the Bilvapañcaka family. He mentions at the end that he wrote the work after consulting the follow ing works and authors viz. Kalpataru, Kamadhenu, Halāyudha, Dharmakosa, Smrtisára, Krtyasagara, Ratnakara, Parijāta, the two Sambitás of Manu and Yajnavalkya with the commentaries thereon; besides Vyavahāratilaka, Pradipika and Pradipa. Besides those mentioned in the verses at the end and besides the two epics, Purinas, Dharmasutras and smstis he mentions also Krtya såra (p. 28), Graheśvaranišra (pp 27, 13+), Candeśvara, Catur varga-cintamaņi (326, 346-7). Parāśarab räsya (p. 279), Bhava deva (pp. 77, 238, 347, 353), Bhüpālapaddhati (136), Balabhūşana (p. 135), Miśràḥ (i, e. Vacaspatimiśra, his guru 64, 65, 92, 195, 97, 282, 317), Vivāda-cintāmaņi (211, 278 ), Samayaprakāśa (136), Smstisagara (136), Sūlapāņi (240), Harinātha (p. 251, 326 ), Harihara ( 182 ). 
It appears that he composed nine works viz. Dandaviveka, Dvaitaviveka, Ganzākstyaviveka, Peribhāṣāviveka, Smộtitattva viveka, Dharmapradipa, Smrtiparibhası, Smrtitattvāmrta, Smộti tattvāmsta-sāroddhāra ( abridgement of the preceding ). For the Smộtitattvàista, vide Mitra's Notices, Vol, VI No. 1992 pp. 12-13 on (Santika-Paustika) where his mother's name is given as Gauri. The 2nd verse of that work is interesting. 1296 It says at present people's usages differ from Sastra; when there is a conflict Sastra is stronger and therefore it has been accepted in this work. For Smstitativāmsta-sároddhāra Vide Mitra's Notices Vol. VI p. 57 ( where at the end he refers to the Dandaviveka his as work). On p. 76 of the Dandaviveka he refers to his own Dvaitaviveka.1297 At the end of the Sonrtitattvaviveka (Mitra's Notices Vol. V No. 1868 pp. 183-185 the colophon describes Vardhamāna as Mahă dharmadhikärm (Judge).

Some of his references are interesting e. g. he quotes a prose passage of Vispugupta about Rūpyamāsaka, Dharana, Nişka and a verse of Vişnugupta stating that 1/70th part of a suvarna is called ropaka and a dināra is equal to 28 ropakas,1298 
On p. 28 he refers to another view of Vişnugupta on * Māşa ’.1299 in one place (p. 291-292 ) he cites some cases of conflict between Dharmaśāstra and Arthasastra and between two dharmaśāstras also.1300 
The English Introduction to the Dandaviveka is an instruc tive one. It compares the provisions in the Dandaviveka with the Indian Penal Code and the modern criminal law of India and well brings out the points of agreement and difference between them. 
As to his date there is no much difficulty. He was a pupil of Vàcaspatimisra and refers to the Vivadacintamani of that great Maithila scholar and therefore was a junior contemporary of Vacaspati. He flourished under king Bhairava of Mithila ( 5th Intro, verse of Dandaviveka) who belonged to the Kameśvara dynasty. In J. A. S. B. vol. XI ( New Series, p. 433 ) a complete list of the kings of this dynasty and the probable dates of the authors that flourished under the Karnața and Kumeśvara dyna. sties is set out, according to which Sankaramisra (one of the gurus of Vardhamana ) flourished in the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 15th century A. D., while Vacaspati flourished in the 3rd and 4th quarters of the same century and Vardhamana must have flourished some decades before La. San. 376 (i. e. 1496

Raghunandana refers to him as Vardhamānopàdhyâya or Navya-vardhamāna in order to distinguish him from another Vardhamana, son of Gangesopadhyāya, who flourished in the 13th century. Vide Tithittattva (Vol. I, 122) where the Smști paribhāșikà is cited; for citations from Navya-Vardhamana vide Smộtitattva Vol. I, tithi pp, 19, 184, Sraddha, 213, 224; Áhnika p. 332 (Raghu. differs ), 352, 424, Mala. pp. 803, 815, 818. The Sraddha-pradipa of Vardhamana is mentened by Raghu. in Sraddhatattava (vol I) p. 414. 
In the Journal of Oriental Institute (Baroda ), vol. II (pp. 71-85) Dr. Ludo Rocher (Ghent University) furnishes an analysis of all mss. of the Dandaviveka with varions readings. 
103. Npsimhaprasāda This is an encyclopaedic work on dharmaśāstra, no part of which had been printed when the first volume of the H. of Dh. was published in 1930. Since then, however, four parts of it have been published in the series called Princess of Wales Sarasvatibhavana Texts (the General editor being M. M. Gopinath Kaviraja ) viz. Vyavahårasāra (edited by Pandit Vinayaksastri Tillu, Sanskrit College, Benares ), Prāyaścitta-sāra (edited by Pandit Nandakishore Sharma and Nandakumar Sharma Sahitya charya ), Śrăddhasāra ( ed. by Pandit Vidyadhara Misra, College of Oriedtal Learnir.g, Benares, Hindu University), and Tirthasara (edited by Pandit Süryanårāyaṇa Sukla, Assistant Professor, Govt. Sanskrit College, Benares ), the first three being published in 1934 and the 4th in 1936. 
The Benares Sanskrit College bas a complete ms. of this vast work. I could examine the whole of it. Besides, the Deccan College collection has two mss. of portions of it, viz. of the Dåpasāra ( No. 353 of 1875-76 ) and of the Tirthasāra (No. 352 of 1875-76). The Dànasāra and Santisára are also noticed in Mitra's Cat. of Bikaner mss. (pp. 429-430) and six sections out of twelve are noticed in the I, O, Cat. p. 434 No. 1467. Unless otherwise stated the references here are103.

to the Benares Sanskrit College ms, and to the four printed parts thereof. 
The NȚsimhaprasada is divided into twelve1301 sections called ' sāra' on samskāra, ahnika, Sraddha, kala, vyavahara, prayascitta, karmavipaka, vrata, dāna, śānti ( the averting of evil foreboded by natural portents and other strange occurrences ), tirtha and pratistha (consecration of temples, idols etc.). Each section2802 begins with an invocation of Nýsimha ( the man-lion incarnation of Visnu) after whom the work is named Nșsimhaprasada (the fruit of the grace of Nrsimha). In the Samskārasara, after in voking Nrsimha, the introduction tells us that130s when king Rāma ruled in Devagiri ( modern Daulatabad), Samavit was ruler of Delhi and that after the latter Nijāmasāha wielded power over the world. Then after pronouncing an eulogy on Nijāma säha ( verses 10-13) the author speaks of himself. We1304 are told that the author was Dalapati ( or Daladhisa), son of Vallabha, of the Bharadvāja-gotra and of the Yājõavalkiya sākba (i. e. Suklayajurveda ) and that he was the keeper of the imperial records of Nebajana (?). Should we read in note 1304 'श्रीमन्ने

quuted in the Intro. (p. 6) to the Vyavahārasāra. 1302 e. g. verse 8 of the संस्कारसार. The first verse of आहिकसार is 
प्रणम्य श्रीनृसिंहेन (हं तु ? ) दलाधीशेन भूभुजा । श्रीनृसिंहप्रसादन दिनानुष्ठेय मुच्यते ।।; the श्राद्धसार begins 'श्रीनृसिंहं नमस्कृत्य दलाधीशमहीपतिः ।

This verse occurs in each i at the end with variations. In the D. C. ms. No. 358 of 1875-76 the last two lines are श्रीमद्वल्लभसू नुरात्मनिरतस्तत्संप्रदायागणी: सारे दानकसंज्ञकेतिचतुरे श्रीमान्दलाधीश्वरः ।।

बजने समस्तकरणाधीशः'? This will remove the defect in the metre, but the question would still remain 'who was Nebajana ?'. Besides, the printed दीर्थसार, प्रायश्चित्तसार and श्राद्धसार read the latter half of the verse as श्रीमदलभम् नुरात्मनिरतः सत्सप्रदायाग्रणी:...श्रीमान्दलाधी श्वरः There are elaborate colophonsisos at the end of almost each section (called sāra ) in which we are told that Dalapati was the pupil of Süryapardita, that he was a great exponent of the Vaisnavadharm.a, that he was the chief minister and keeper of the records of Nijāmasāha, who was the overlord of all Yavanas ( Mahomedans) and ruler of Devagiri. In some colophons — Dalapati or Daladhisa ' is styled Maharajadhiraja. H. P. Shastri in his Preface to Vol. III of the Catalogue of Govt. Mss. (pp. XXIII-XXIV) in the custody of the Bengal Asiatic Society remarks that Dalapatiraya was chief of Gadh mandla and had a commanding position in the Nizamshahi kingdom of Ahmednagar. Dalapati's wife was the famous Durgavati who so bravely fought against the generals of Akbar that the latter had to come hiniself to invade her capital, It is doubtful whether Dalapati or Dalidhisa was the real name of the author or was merely a title. It is not unlikely that Suryapandita, said to be the guru of the author, is the same as Sürya, the father of the great Maratha saint Ekanātha, who wrote his Bhāgavata at Benares in śake 1495 (i. e. 1573 A. D.) and who states that he was born in a family of devout Vaişņavas. 
The Nșsimhaprasāda names numerous authors and works. In the beginning of the Samskärasāra, he mentions a host of writers and works that he consulted.1308 Besides these he

The contents of some of tiie sections of the Nțsimhaprasada may he set out here. In the Sarriskurasára the author treats of the meaning of dhai ma, śruti, smrti, the authoritativeness of purāņas, kalivarjya (usa es prohibited in the kali age ), punyāha Vacana, madhuparka, ymddhisraddha, garbhadhāna, pussavana, jātakarma, nāmakarana, upanayana, marriage and other sanskaras, the duties of brahmacărins, snātakas, householders, vānaprasthas and samnyāsins. In the Ahnilasära the author, after dividing the day into eight parts, speaks of the actions appropriate to each viz. : in the first getting up from bed at the brāhma muhurta, sauca, brushing the teeth, decoration of the hair, bath etc.; in the second, study; iii the third, looking after dependents and pursuit of one's livelihood; in the fourth, midday bath, brahmayajñ.", tarpsna, vaišvadleva. daily Śräddba, in the fifth dinner and foods prescribed and forbidden; in the sixth and sevenih reflecting over i:ihisa and purāns; in the 8th decision about worldly affirs, evening samdlıyă etc. In the Kalasära (which is in onplete in the Benarcs ms.) he defines the nature of kala and gives rules and decisions about months, tithis and such festivals as Navarătra, Janmastani etc. In the Vyavahāra sāra the author deals with the neaning of vyavahāra, the eighteen titles of law, the four-fold method of deciding dharma, the pramānas (means of proof), diyavibhaga etc. In the Vratasàra he speaks of the several principal vratas in each month, some of which are for both men and women, some for men only and some !, I women only. In the Dānasāra he dilates upon the nature of Säna, its varieties, the various results of dànas, the proper time and place for dānas, proper recipients of dàna, what things can be the subjects of gifts, units of gold, silver etc., the description of kunda, mandapa and vedi, the sixteen great danas such as tuli, hiranyagarbha, brahmānda, kalpapádapa etc., and three atitlánas, viz. land, cows and learning; gifts of image, food, ornaments, bed-stead etc.; gifts on sa zkrānti and eclipses etc. The Tirthasara is interesting for this that as the author hailed from Devagiri he 
864 
History of Dharmasastra 
speaks principally of tirthas of the Deccan and Southern India. In his work he speaks of Setubandha, Pundarika1307 or Paunda rika (modern Pandharpur in the Sholapur District, it seems ), Gayatirtha, eulogics of Godavari, Krsna-Venyā, Narmada, Malaprahārini etc. 
As four parts of Nrsimhaprasada have been published, it would be necessary to say a few words on each of the four. 
The Vyavahårasāra is rather a large work in 280 pages. It relies sparingly on the Dharmasotras of Ápastamba, Gautama, Vasiştha and Vişnu, quotes only a verse from Baudhāyana. It quotes from Nārada several hundred verses, also from Bịha spati and Katyayana. Similarly, most of the verses in Yājña valkvasmsti on Vyavahāra are quoted and the Manusmịti also is profusely cited. But out of other Smstis only a few like those of Usanas (p. 12), Pitamaha (only on ordeals ), Yama (p. 7), Vyasa, Sankha-likhita (p. 200), Samvarta, Hàrita (pp. 34, 35, 213) are quoted. The Sangrahakära is quoted twice (pp. 69 and 219 ). 
ITA? 
The Prayascitta-sára has 236 printed pages and deals with the following maters. Derivation and meaning of the word Prayascitta ; P. to be prescribed by a parişod; five mahāpātakas (killing a brāhmaza &c.); enumeration of patakas that are equal to Mahāpatakas; those sins that are called Anupatakas and Upapatakas; those guilty of Malāpåtakas fall into terrible hells and after undergoing the torments of hell are born as dogs, donkeys, and the like and then they are again born as men suffering from such disease as consumption or are born as când-las &c. (Yâj. III. 206-215); one should perform appropriate penances for sins; requesting the Parisad to declare the proper penance. It is unnecessary to set out the penances (in view of the fact that a good deal has been stated on them from the Prayascitta-viveka of Śülapāņi above.

Besides the Smrtis1308 and Puràņas, the work mentions Dharmavivști (pp. 5, 201 ), Mitaksarà (p. 189 and differs from it about the meaning of 'Brahmakurca'), Rājanighantu (p. 138 ), Vākyamimàńsă (138-139 ), Subodhini (com. on Yāj. by Viśveśvarabhatta ), Susruta, Smstisāgara ( 206 ), Smrtyarthasāra. 
The Srăddhasāra is comparatively a small work (in 168 printed pages) but it quotes a far larger number of authors and works than the other two. In the Śrāddhasāra (p. 106) the author refers to the fact that the portion on Dāna had been already composed, that Ahnika had already been dealt with, that Prayascittasára preceded Sraddhasāra1309 (vide p. 64 *uktam caitat-bahu Prāyascitte'). On p. 29 it remarks that it will expatiate at length cr the proper time for a certain śrāddha in Kālanirnayasāra.

It quotes for its size numerous authorities, particularly smrtis and Purā ņas,1309a but nibandhas or digests rarely. It men tions the Mitāksarā (p. 43), Mădhavācārya (p. 94 ), Smrticandri kākāra (p. 71 in the plurai ), Smộtiratnāvalikāra (p. 94 in the plural). 
The Tirthaşára is a small work in 103 pages. It deals with the following tirthas ( 16 in number ) all in the Deccan and South India except Gayā 310 namely, Setubandba (and Rāmeśvara ), Pundarika ( Pandharpur on the Bhimă, where there is Panduranga's image ), Amardaka (Nāganātha pp. 21 30), Gayā, Godāvari (and subsidiary tirthas ), Krsņa-Veni (and tirthas subsidiary to them ), Narmadā and eight more. The principal authorities are Purāņas, viz. Kālikā, Kūrma, Garuda, Padma, Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Brahmānda, Matsya, Vāmana, Vāyu, Vişnu, Saura, Skanda. The few other author ities that are quoted are BỊhaspati (p. 34, several verses, probably from some purāna ), Mahābhārata (on pp. 30, 41, 42-43), Yāj. (on p. 39, a half verse I. 261), Vasisthasmsti (p. 33), Vyāsa (p. 89, two verses ). 
The Nșsimhaprasåda being a work from the Deccan held the view that marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter was sanctioned by the Veda and was not to be censured.1911 It says 
1309" The Purāṇas quoted in Śrāddhasāra are": 37 (twenty-four

that where there is (irreconcileable ) conflict between the smộtis and purāṇas there is an option.1312 
As the Nșsimhaprasāda relies upon the Mādhaviya and the Madanapărijāta, it is certainly later than 1400 A. D. As it is mentioned as an authority in the Dvaitanirņaya of Sankara bhatta and in the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha, it must be earlier than about 1575 A. D. If by the Dipikavivarana, which it enumerates among its principal authorities, is meant the com. of Nýsiṁha, son of Rāmacandrācărya, on his father's comment ary of the Kalanirnaya (which is most probable), then the Nșsimhaprasada must be later than about 1500 A.D. Dr. Bhandar kar1313 says that Ramacandrācārya lived about 1450 A. D. A ms. of the Dipikāvivarana was copid in sainvar 1604 ( 1548 A. D.).1314 The Benares Sanskrit College ms. appears to have been copied for Rāmapandita Dharmadhikari at Benares, who is said to have been the father of Nandapandita 315 ( see sec. 110 below). At the end of several sāras either samvat 1568 (1511-12 A. D.) or 1569 occurs as the date.1316 This may be said to be the date of the actual composition of the work or of the copying of the ms. for Ramapandita. It seems difficult to believe that Rāmapandita for whom the ms. was copied in 1511-12 A. D. was the father of the famous Nandapandita. We know that Nandapaudita composed his Vaijayanti in 1623 A. D. Rāmapandita must have been a man of middle age before he could order the copying of a huge ms. like the Nțsimhaprasada. If he did this in 1511-12 A. D. bis son could i ardly have been alive 120 years later. Therefore it looks probable ihat the dates ( samvat 1568 and 1569) are not

the dates when the ms. was copied for Rāmapandita, but rather the dates of the composition of the original work or of the copy ing the ms. from which Ramapandita got his own ms. copied, At all events it is clear that the Nosimhaprasāda could not have been composed later than 1512 A. D. As the author was a minister of Nijāmasāha who ruled over Devagiri, it appears that he is referring to Ahmad Nizam Shah who ruled from 1490-1508 A. D. or to his son Burhan Nizam Shah ( 1508-1533 A. D.), most probably the former.1317 It may be taken as certain that the work was composed between 1190 and 1512 A. D. 
The author Dalapati appears (if it is his proper name) to have been a south Indian. He mentions only a few authors and digests by name among which are South Indian Madhavācārya, Mitāksarā, Smsticandrikā, Smrtyarthasàra. There are also some other indications. In the Sraddhasāra, while dilating on going to Gayà for sraddha, the author first quotes a verse prescribing that the pilgrim intending to go to Gayā should first perform a śrāddha, should be dressed in a karpata (worn out or ragged clothes) and should circumambulate his village.1318 The author says that provision is not restricted to one going to Gayā alone, but also applies to Godavari when Jupiter is in the sign of Leo. 
It may be noted that the Nșsimhaprasāda had become a well-known work of some authority before 1600 A. D. even at Benares. The Nirnayasindhu composed in 1612 A. D. (2nd Pariccheda on Navaratra ) refers to passages quoted on Navaratra in Nțsimhaprasada.

104. Pratäparudradeva 
The Sarasvativilāsa was compiled by Pratāparudradeva, a king of the Gajapati dynasty who ruled at Cuttack (Katakanagari) in Orissa. The Dayabhāga portion of this work was published with an English translation by Rev. Thomas Foulkes in 1881. When the materials for the first volume were being collected, this work dealing with Vyavabăra was in the Press. It was edited by Dr. R. Sham Sastry and was published as a volume in the Oriental Library Publications of the University of Mysore. It is a large work containing 503 pages of the text with an Introduction of thirty-two pages containing an Index of the topics dealt with in it, errata and an account of the mss. on which the edition is based. 
After invoking deities the work starts with the prasasti of the king and his family (pp. 2–11). Descent is traced to the Sun bim self through Dasaratha, Rāma and his sons. Rāma, his son Kuša, his son Atithi and in this family of the Raghus was born Kapi lendra, founder of Gajapati dynasty, whose son was Purusottama. His queen was Rupămbika. Pratāparudradeva or Vira-Rudra-deva was the son of Purusottama. He is spoken of as having given protection to Sultan (Suratrāņa) Husanshah who threw himself on his mercy.1319 In the coloprions 320 the king is styled Gajapati, Gaudesvara (king of Gauda), lord of Kalubariga (modern Gulbarga ) in the Karnataka country of nine crores (probably of revenue ) and as the protector of Sultan Husanshah of Jamunapura. It is significant that the same titles are applied to Puruşottamal321 in his Potavaram grant of sake 1412 (1490 A.

D.) and in other inscriptions. Prataparudradeva, while ruling his capital1323 Katakanagari, called together an assembly of Pandits and compiled an extensive digest of civil and religious law. The royal author feels qualms of conscience on the question of eulogising himself and his family but stifles them easily by saying that a poet can also be an appreciative critic of his own productions.1323 He boasts that he composed the work for saving scholars the trouble of bringing harmony among the conflicting dicta of Vijnanayogi, Aparārka, Bharuci and others, that there was no work that could equal his own and that his literary effort would make his predecessors' works afford illu strations of the maxim that when a certain purpose is served by one the existence of others is superfluous. 1824 Then it is said that the Vyavahārakānda was first taken in hand even before the Ācārakānda following the special desire of the king Virarudra Gajapati,1325 But it appears from references in the Vyavahāra kānda itself that before that part was finished the Acārakanda had been completed.1328_The Sarasvativilasa, being a work composed under the express orders of a king for the benefit of his subjects, makes the nearest approach to the Austinian conception of law as a command addressed by political superiors to political inferiors and enforced by a sanction. 
The principal topics dealt with in the Vyavabàrakanda are: the hall of justice, the method of judicial procedure, the plaint, the reply, documents, possession, ļnādāna, dāyavibhāga, sähasa

and other titles of law. In the beginning of the work he sets out at great length the views of ancient writers on politics about the constitution of the mandala, such as those of Parāśara, Usanas, Visnu, Brhaspati, Visalaksa, Manu etc. He generally follows the views of Vijñānesvara on dayavibhāga, but here and there strongly criticizes bim e. g. he says that Vijñāneśvara gave a very far-fetched interpretation1327 of Yajnavalkya's verse "rikthagrāba ļņam dăpyah'. Another interesting example of of criticism of Vijnanesvara is found on p. 457 of Sar. V. 'विज्ञानयोगिना यदुक्तं विवादपदानां परस्परसङ्गतिर्नास्ति तत्परास्तं वेदितव्यम्'. This passage has in view the Mitākṣarā passage at the beginning of Svāmipālavivada (taken up immediately after dealing with Simāvivada) 'व्यवहारपदानां परस्परहेतुमद्भावाभावात् तेषामाद्यमृणादानमित्यादि पाठक्रमो न विवक्षित इति व्युत्क्रमेण स्वामिपालविवादोऽभिधीयते।' for 'तेषामद्य ' vide Manu VIII. 4-7. Similarly another proposition associated with the 
Mitaksara is attacked by the Sar. V. (p. 396) viz. यत्तु विज्ञानयोगिना स्वत्वं लौकिकं लौकिकक्रियासाधनत्वाद् ब्रीह्यादिवदित्युक्तं तदुग्रन्थं स्थूलमिव प्रतिभाति. On the other hand, Varadaraja refers to Vijõānesvara as 'Brahmavit-pravara ' (eminent or best among those who realized brahman on pp. 253 and 270 of Vyavaharanirnaya). ___It may be noted that the Sar. V. names (on pp. 13--14)1388 41 Smrtikāras, some Upasmrtis, 18 Puranas and makes a distinc tion between Tikākāras (like Vijñāteśvara) and Nibandhanakāras (i. e. digest-writers ) like Lakşmidhara. On p. 12 he quotes a

verse containing names of sages like Manu, and Vasistha and Yogiśvara and Nibandhanakäras like Bhăruci, Kulärka and Yogiśvara. 
The Sar. V., though a late work, is of great importance in some respects. In scores of places it cites the different views or explanations of Vijñāneśvara and Bhăruci on the same topic or verse. A few examples may be cited here. (1) On Yāj. I. 312 ( Sar. V. p. 23 on “sthirah'), Yāj. I. 313 ( Sar. V. p. 20 on the 
• uditodita'), Yaj. I. 317 ( on 'pātreșu ', Sar. V. p. 24), Yāj. I. 327 (no krama of the several acts is intended' says Bhăruci in Sar. V. p. 30). 
Differences of opinion between Bhāruci and Vijñāneśvara are pointed out by Sar, V. as to several matters, e. g. on p. 308 Sar. V. states that Vijñanayogin, Asahāya and Medhātithi allowed recourse to ordeal in the case of a dispute about sale by one who was not the owner of the property sold (asvāmivikraya ), while Bharuci, Aparārka and Smộticandrikà did not allow such recourse to ordeals in that matter. Recently Dr. Derrett (of the London School of Oriental and African Studies) came across a ms, of Bharuci's commentary on some chapters of the Manusmặti found at Trivandrum and he is thinking of bringing out an edition of the part available. Here and there the Sar. V. cites Bharuci's explanations of several passages of Manu and also explanations of Vijñānesvara. For example, on Manu VIII. 383 (Sahasram 
(Continued from the previous page) वैष्णव-शैव-भागवत-नारदीय-मार्कण्डेयाग्नेय-भविष्यत्-ब्रह्मवैवर्त-लैङ्ग-वाराह-स्कान्द वामन-कौम-मत्स्य-गारुड-ब्रह्माण्डानि एतान्यष्टादशपुराणानि । सरस्वती विलास pp. 13–14. टीकाकारैर्विज्ञानयोगिप्रभृतिभिर्निबन्धकारैः कुलार्कलक्ष्मीधरप्रभृतिभि: लोकानुजिघृ क्षया स्मृतिव्याख्यानव्याजेन सर्वाः स्मृतया व्याख्याताः शिष्टानुगृहीतसर्वानुष्ठापक gefterlaluargary chlag i Franta p. 14. The word nibandhana' or 'njbandhanakāra' often occurs in the Sar, V.(e. g. pp. 52, 53, 149, 349, 451, 456, 468). It appears likely that Nibandhanakāra in these cases does not refer to one work only, but to different digests at different places, On p. 53 it is noted that a Nibandhanakāra followed Närada as regards the order ( Krama ) of the 18 Vyavahūrapadas and 
not the order given in the Manusmrti.

brāhmaṇo dandam &c.) he quotes the views of both Vijñāneśvara and Bhāruci;- vide also Sar. V. pp. 369-373 where Manu, Yaj. and Vişnu are quoted and the differing views of Bhāruci and Vijñāneśvara are pointed out. A few more cases, where Bbāruci's coniments along with those of others on some verses of Manu are cited, may by pointed out. On p. 348 Manu IX. 103 is cited and the word 'Dayadharmam'occurring therein is explained by Bhāruci as indicating both Dāyavibhāga and Dharmavibhāga. On p. 360 Manu IX. 118 ( svebhyo &c.) is explained by Sar. V. which points out that Asahāya, Medhātithi, Vijñānesvara hold views opposed to those of Bharuci and Aparărka. Vide also Sar, V. pp. 389-90 where are cited Manu V. 197 and 161 and the different explanations of Vijñānesvara and Bhāruci are set out. 
Another interesting matter is that the Sar. V. cites in many places the explanations of certain sūtras and words of Vişnu and gives their interpretations by Bharuci; vide for example pp. 160, 314-15, 318-19, 422–23, 427-28, 430-32, 447-48, 487, 488-89. The question arises whether Bhăruci wrote a commentary on Vişnu as well as on Manu or whether he embodied many com ments on Vişnu in his commentary on Manusmīti. That question cannot be answered until Bharuci's commentary on Manu is available in print, 
It may be mentioned here that the Sarasvativilāsa paid high honour to Bhåruci, since on p. 428 it refers to Bhăruci as 
bhagavat' and it appears that Pratàparudra and his helpers possessed a copy of the commentary of Bhāruci on Manu. 
On p. 457 Sar. V. quotes a verse of Visnugupta for explaining a sútra of Vişnu. Who this Visņugupta is cannot be definitely stated. Kautilya, who also is called Visnugupta in the Mudrà raksasa, has some of these terms (in II. 19. 2-9) but there is no such verse in the Kautiliya. It may be pointed out that the Bịhaj-jātaka of Varahamihira in VII. 7 and XXI. 3 mentions the views of Vişnugupta and that Utpala ( who comments on Bșhaj jātaka ) quotes two Aryā verses of Vişnugupta. So a Vişnugupta (writer on astrology ) flourished before 500 A, D Whether Căpakya and Visnugupta are identical is discussed by the present author in his paper on Varahamihira and Utpala' in JBBRAS New Series Vol. 24. 3 at p. 19.

The Sarasvativilăsa quoted the views of Varadarāja in sevaral places (e. g. on pp. 135, 179, 268-69, 276, 319 )1329 his work must be earlier than about 1500 A. D., as Pratãparudra ruled from 1497 to 1538 A. D. and the king refers to him as an àdhunika (recent writer) on p. 325 ( of the Sarasvativilāsa under `Kritvā nusaya '). It is noteworthy that the Sarasvativilása, which quotes Aparārka many times (as on pp. 230, 262, 264, 308 ) and Smsti-candrikā dozens of times (as on pp. 212, 230, 235, 242, 264, 267, 275, 308, 350 ) does not speak of Aparărka or the Candrika (or Smsti-candrikā) as 'àdhunika'. The Smsticandrikā would have to be placed between 1200 A. D. to 1240 A. D., as it quotes Aparārka and is very largely quoted by Hemadri. Therefore Varadaraja has to be assigned to a period between 1450 to 1500 A. D. in order that in a work like the Sarasvativilāsa composed in the first quarter of the 16th century he may be called *adhunika' (recent, modern). 
The Sarasvativilása is a work of authority in Soutbern India on matters of Hindu Law, though inferior to the Mitaksarā.1330 It informs us that, though the Snısticandrikā passed over the ordeals of water and poison on the ground that they had gone out of vogue, in Utkala the ordeal of water alone was resorted 
1329 Some decisive references may be given here to the passages 
in Varadarāja's Vyavahāranirņaya ( ed. by the late Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar ), which are quoted in Pratāparudra's Sarasvativilāsa ( on Vyavahāra ). 1. Op p. 135 of Pratāparudra's work there is a long quota tion of the respective strength of title and mere possession in different circumstances, which repeats what Varadarāja says on p. 132 of the Vyavahāranirnaya. 2. On pp. 275-76 of the Sarasvativilāsa a passage is quoted as cited from Kautilya by Varadarāja : 312 417 fasur: 1 3 ऋत्विजि मृते पश्चादन्यं वृणुयात् । पूर्ववृतस्यैव दक्षिणा ! पश्चादाहूतः यत्किंचिल्लमते चेति । यत्तिचिच्छब्दार्थमाह कौटिल्यः । अग्निष्टोमादिषु दीक्षणीयाया ऊर्व 9737STHT:, TÁTAZ 377 HT ... 977:ATTEET TETTI HTETTHANE 5 warg Tourg Hautfa ATEIT: 1 This occurs in व्यवहारनिर्णय of वरदराज (pp. 284-85); it is found in Kautiliya

to and in Śūrasena (Mathurā ) and Magadha ( Bihar ) the ordeal of poison alone was administered 1331 
Besides the usual dharmasútras and other smītis, the principal authors and works named in the Sarasvativilāsa are noted below.1332 The Sarasvativilāsa presents in the case of the dharmasútras, particularly of Vişnu and Gautama, great varia tions from the printed texts of these works (vide sec. 10, p. 127 above ). The Sarasvativilāsa in scores of places gives the con flicting views of Bharuci and the Mitūksarā (for which see under Bhăruci, sec. 62). The Sarasvativilāsa also contains valuuable information about the views of such authors as Asahāya, Bhava deva and Srikara whose works have not yet come to light. 
Burnell (introduction to Vamsa Brāhmaṇa p. VII took Pratāparudradeva to be the king of that name who belonged to the Kakatiya-Gapapati dynasty of Warangal and who was carried captive to Delhi in 1332 A. D. But in this he was wrong. It has been shown above that the king connected with the com position of the Sarasvativilāsa belonged to the Gajapati dynasty that ruled at Cuttack and not at Warangal. Pratāparudradeva ruled from 1497 to 1539 A. D. Therefore the Sarasvativilāsa must have been composed in the first quarter of the 16th cent ury. Foulkes thinks (Intro. p. XX) that the work was com posed about 1515 A. D. His argument is that though the commentary of Madhavācārya was written about two hundred years before the Sarasvativilása, the latter is entirely silent about it in his work and that the reason of this is to be sought for in the rivalry of the two dynasties of Prataparudra and Krşparāya

of Vijayanagara which was set at rest by a marriage alliance about 1516 A. D. Vide Prof. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar's 'Sour ces of Vijayanagar History' (p. 116), where we are told that the daughter of the Orissa king married to Krspadevarāja was named Jaganmohini (according to some) or Tukkà (according to others) and Sewell's ' A Forgotten Empire' p. 320. Another argument advanced by Foulkes for 1515 A. D. as the date of the work is that during the latter part of his reigo Prataparu dradeva had come under the induence of the great Vaišnavite saint Caitanya, who made Puri his residence during the last years of his life and that the Sarasvativilāsa has in the beginning an invocation of Siva. Caitanya was born in sake 1407 Phālguna Full-moon (i, e. in 1486 A. D.); vide Bhandarkar's “Vaisnavism and saivism' (p. 83) and Caitanya is said to have gone to Puri about 1510 A, D, and died in 1533 A. D. Beames in Ind. Ant. vol. II, p. 1 ff.). Both these arguments are not of much weight. As a matter of fact in some mss. there is an invocation of both Vişnu (Hayagriva ) and Śiva; vide Descriptive Cat, of Govern ment S. mss. at Madras vol. VI, p. 2426 No. 3221. 
Among the latest works and authors of certain dates that the Sarasvativilāsa names are the Smộticandrikà and Varadarāja. Some confusion has been caused by the fact that there were two kings called Pratāparudra viz. King Pratāparudra Gajapati (ruler of Orissa) and Pratãparudra Kakatiya (of Warangal). There is a work called Pratáparudra-Yaśobhūsana on Sanskrit Poetics (in cluding dramaturgy composed by Vidyānātha and published in the Bombay Sanskrit Series (in 1909) edited by K. P. Trivedi. In that work while dealing with dramaturgy a Sanskrit drama is put forward in which Pratāparudra Kakatiya is the hero (p. 135) (vide pp. 131-218 of that work). He ruled over Andhradeśa called Trilinga because that country has three famous lingas (Grisaila, Kaleśvara and Draksārāma) and he was also called Vira-rudra or Rudra. He was the son of Mahādeva and Mummudi or Mummudamba. It would be seen that the parents of the two Pratāparudras were different and that their capitals were different (Katakanagara of the Gajapati king and Ekasila of the Kakatiya king). 
An interesting question about the authorship of the Sar. V. was raised by the late Dr. P. K. Gode in the Calcutta Oriental 
104. Pratāparudradeva 
877 
Journal, Vol. II (1934–35 ) pp. 229-231 and he suggested that the real author of the Sarasvativilāsa was Lolla Laksmīdhara, who wrote a commentary on the Sundaryalahari of Sri Sankara cārya. In the journal of the Bihar Research Society (for 1950), Vol. 36 (parts 3-4 pp. 15-18 ) Mr. R. Subrahmanyam raises the same question and answers it by saying that the Sarasvativilāsa was really composed by Lolla Lakşmidhara. The arguments advanced are iimsy and worth little. He boldly asserts that the author of the Sar. V. nowhere gives his own opinion or hazards his bonafides. One fails to understand what he means by the first part of his dictum. In dozens of places the author of Sar. V. gives his own opinions on the varying interpretations of Vijñāneśvara and of Bharuci and others. Vide above and notes for striking examples of the decisive conclusions reached by Pratáparudra (such as that on the question of Svatva cited above ). 
I regret to say that Mr. Subrahmanyam has not made clear what he means hy saying that he (Pratāparudra ) nowhere gives his opinion and I am afraid that he has not read the original text carefully. In many cases he gives his opinions and pre fers one explanation to another. Vide p. 208; he employs the words tan-jiandam' against Vijñānesvara and expressly says 
asmad-uktaiva vyavasthì samyak'. On pp. 160-161 he refers to the differing explanations of the Smşiicandrikả and Bharuci and expressly says Bharuci's explanation is the proper one. For reasons of space it is not possible to dilate at length on this first charge against Pratāparudra. Only a few references to pages where he prefers one view to another are given here. Vide pp. 109 (Vijñāneśvaramatameva samyak ), 154 ( where the views of both Bhavadeva sad Apararka are declared as heya i. e. to be rejected); p. 384 (asahāya-vyākhyānamasahāyam), p. 458 ( Medhātithi-vyākhyānam svamatikalpitam iti mantavyam). The criticism against his reference to Ganapati, Sarasvati, Hanuman is to say the least worth little. Even a Vaisňava king has to pay regard to the views of the subjects in his realm and when he comes forward as an author he may follow the usual pattern of his predecessors viz. of making obeisance to Ganapati and to Sarasvati. But even when making homage to Hanumat in introductory stanza he emphasizes that Hanumat learnt from his

Upadhyâya (ādyād-upādhyāyāt ) viz. Raghuvara (i. e. Rāma who was an incarnation of Vispu) and verse 6 refers to Krsna (who was a child of the Yadavas ). Therefore, there is hardly anything in the Introductory verses to detract from his being a staunch Vaisnava. Further, Mr. Subrahmanyam is offended by the use of the words “Kāntānām Kāmadevah' and remarks that nobody would write like this. All that is meant is that women looked upon the king as the paragon of beauty. Lastly Mr. Subrahmanyam complains that the king has overdone the permitted bounds of self-laudation. No limits have been set anywhere for self-laudation. But one example of another royal author several centuries earlier than Prataparudra may be cited for com parison viz. of Apararka who in the 5th Introductory verse of his commentary on Yāj. states that even God Śiva was astonished by the King's bhakti and that Bịhaspati himself was astonished by the king's intellect and the Sun by his brilliance (svatva ).1333 
Lolla Lakşmidliara appears to have been a braggart. In his com, on the Saundaryalahari he gives at the end of his commentary a long list of his several ancestors and credits each of them with the authorship of works, hardly any one of which has been noticed so far in the numerous reports on Sanskrit Mss. It is possible that he might have been one of the Pandits called to help king Pratáparudra. He must have been paid for his tro uble and there the matter ended. This is like the case of Všveśvarabhatti who helped Mandanapala in his works and whose name occurs as the author in the ms. of some of those works, It is known that Godavaramiśra was a learned court poet of Pratāparudra (vide Dr. Gode commemoration volume pp. 63-67 for him ). 
Vide JBORS. vol. V, pp. 147-148 and Ind. Ant, for 1929, pp. 28-33 for information about the Empire of Orissa and its emperors, Kapilendra (who died in 1470 A. D.), Purusottama deva (1470-1497) and Pratāparudra-deva. 
There is a ms. of a work called Pratăpamārtanda or Pra udhapratāpamārtanda (D. C. ms. No. 48 of 1872–73) which is

The work means 'The Moon (Kalànidhi) of the essence of Dharma, or also Pșthvi candrodaya 'the rise of Pịthvicandra'. This last was a king. The volume now published contains a portion of Vyavahāra prakāša, one of the several parts of a huge digest on dharma. The Introduction (on pp. v-vi) states that only seven parts of the work are available (each in a single ms.) at different places viz. three parts called praksas on Vyavahāra, Vrata and Samaya are available in the Anup Sanskrit Library; there is a ms. of Srāddha-prakāśa in the Bombay University's library. A ms. of the Āsauca-prakása is available in the Library of the Baroda Oriental Institute, a ms. of Gshasthaprakása exists in Sarasvati Bhavan Library of Benares and a ms. of Acăra-prakāśa is available in the Adyar Library, Madras. It is not possible to say how many parts were included or intended to be included in the whole work. But Kalanidhi means 'the Moon' and as the Moon is supposed to have sixteen kalās (kalā tu sodaso 
880 
History of Dharmasastra 
bhāgaḥ- Amarakośa), it was probably intended to spread the digest over sixteen parts. The section on Vyavahāra is called Vyavaliūraprakasa and is divided into 14 ullāsas (lit. 'flashes' or coruscations). Mr. Dave publishes ten out of the 14 ullāsas and is going to publish the remaining four in the near future. 
The Vyavahāraprakāśa (which is the 7th part of the pro posed work) deals with judicial procedure as well as with sub stantive law. The present volume contains the whole of judicial procedure (technically called Vyavahāra) in 202 pages and some titles out of the 18 titles of law (in pp. 203-331 ), viz. from Tādāna to boundary disputes. 
The present work is beautifully printed by the Nirnayasa gar Press (Bombay) and contains (besides the introduction, (pp. V-XI ), the Index of subjects (XIII-XVI ), Sanskrit text (pp. 1-331 ), Index of the verses (p. 333–357, in all over 2000 verses ) and an Index of the names of authors and works (pp. 358-359) which inadvertently omits the names of Garudapurana (p. 271 ), Govindarāja (p. 132 ), Candesvara (p. 161 ), Bhavadeva (p. 116 ) and all passages that are ascribed to the joint author ship of Sankhalikhita in the text as those of Likhita. 
The very first verse claims that king Pșthvicandra personally looked into the causes of the citizens day after day along with learned brāhmaṇas and the judge and states that he begins the composition of a work on vyavahști ( vyavahāra, including both substantive and procedural law). 
More than 50 authorities are cited in the portion published. Among the sutrakāras on Dharma, Vișnu is most frequently quoted, next come Gautama and Sankhalikhita. Among metrical Smrtis Manu is quoted about a hundred times and Yājñavalkya about 120 times. Among the other metrical Smộtis Katyayana, Narada and BỊhaspati are all quoted more than 160 times each. Vyása is quoted 40 times and Pitàrnaba is quoted not only on ordeals but also on several other matters. The Rämāyaṇa is quoted twice and the Mahabharata thrice. Many Puranas such as Agni, Kālika, Brahma, Bhavisya, Matsya, Mārkandeya are quoted but not at great length. Among digests and writers on Dharmaśāstra are mentioned Kalpataru ( several times ), Cande śvara (on p. 161 ), Candrikākāra (i. e. author of Smộticandrika )105. Pythvicandrodaya-Vyavahāraprakāśa 
881 
once on p. 55, Pārijāta ( several times ), Vijñānayogiśvara (on pp. 7, 249), Sarvajña-narayana, commentator of Manu VIII. 53–54, (on p. 63 ) and on Manu VIII. 41, 42, 46, (on p. 33), Halāyudha on p. 161 and 284 ( on Närada's verses.). 
From the colophons at the end of certain sections (Ullāsas) of the portion printed, it appears that the author was the son of Nāgamalla, was a great devotee of Visnu and had such birudas as Kalikāla-karņa, Pratāpa-lankešvara, Ripujayasimha. On p. 279 he refers to Brahmacāriprakāśa as already composed. 
This Vyavahăraprakāśa, when completely printed, would be recognised as a treatise on law and procedure applicable to Hindus in Northern India. The quotations from authorities are ample, to the point, fucid and not burdened with lengthy dis cussions on Mimāṁsā. It keeps throughout a practical end in view viz. to explain the law in easy and clear language. Not only the Vyavahāraprakāśa, but other sections on non-legal topics have been quoted extensively by writers on Dharmaśāstra from the 16th century onwards such as the Nirnayasindhu (which quotes it hundreds of times), the Mayükhas of Nilakantha who quotes it in Acara-m., Samaya m. and Srāddha-m. and others. 
His date can be settled without much difficulty. Mr. Dave points out (in Intro. p. VIII) that on the last leaf of a ms. of the Vyavabàraprakāśa the scribe (named Srivastavya Kayastha ) states that he finished the copying of the work on the 15th of the bright half of Phålguna on Wednesday in Samvat 1530 i. e. ( 1474 A. D.) in the city called Sehunda when king Pșthvicandra was reigning. 
Therefore it follows that the work was composed sometime before 1474 A. D. This date is corroborated by the fact that it cites the Smộticandrikā and Candeśvara and so it must be placed later than about 1375 A, D. Mr. Dave states that Sehunda is now a town in Bundelkhand. It is a remarkable coincidence that three great digests on Dharmaśāstra were composed in Bundelkhanda, viz, the Pộthivicandrodaya, the Bhagavantabhas kara of Nilakantha in twelve parts called Mayükhas (rays ) and the Viramitrodaya of Mitrami:ra (the last two in the first half of the 17th century).

Prof. Velankar's Catalogue of the Sanskrit mss. in the Bombay University No. 251 (p. 52 ) is a ms. of the Sraddha prakāśa, in 24 ullāsas, but it breaks off in the midst of Sampātasråddha. 
In A. vs. B. ( 54 Bom. L. R. pp. 725-754) Mr. Justice Tendulkar had to deal with a case in which a suit had been brought by the husband against the wife for nullity of marriage on the ground that the woman was impotent at the time of marriage and continued to be so thereafter and a decree for nullity of marriage was passed. Many authorities from original Sanskrit texts were cited in the arguments and in the learned judgment (pp. 743-754). In the same volume on pp. 115-119, Dr, Derrett deals with the question in dispute and relevant Sanskrit texts and Mr. Dave, Advocate in the case of A. vs. B. cited above, contributed a paper in the Journal portion (pp. 25-32) of 55 Bom. L. R. The above mentioned case is a con verse of the case Ratan Moni vs. Nagendra Narayan (1945) 1 Cal. 407. 
106. Govindānanda 
Govindananda wrote several works out of which four have been printed in the Bibliotheca Indica series, viz. : the Däna kaumudi, śuddhikaumudi, Sraddhakaumudi, Varşakriyâ-kaumudi. The last work deals with tithinirnaya, vratas on several tiihis all the year round, festivals like Durgotsava, Kojāgara etc. Besides these be wrote a commentary called Arthakaumudi on the Suddhidipikā of Srinivasa which was printed in Bengali characters, and also a commentary called Tattvārtha-kaumudi on Sulapāņi's Prāya ścittaviveka (published by Jivananda at Calcutta ). This com mentary is extensive and learned. A verse eulogising his father's great learning in Astronomy, Vedānta and Smsti occurs in the commentary as well as in Srāddhakriyakaumudi (it is quoted below).1334 His works are of great utility on acccount of the

numerous authors and works quoted therein. The following deserve special mention.1335 He was the son of Ganapatibhatta and was styled Kavikankaņācārya. From the introductory and final verses of his works it appears that he was a Vaisnava. His father was a resident of Bagri in the Midnapur District of Bengal. 
Since he quotes Rudradhara-upādhyāya (pp. 115, 116) and his Srāddhaviveka in Srāddha-kriyakaumudi and Vācaspatimiśra on p. 452 of the same and Srāddhacintamani sixteen times in the same work, he is not earlier than about 1500 A. D. His father coniposed his astronomical work Jyotişmati in Kali year 4613 (i. e. 1512 A. D.), when his name had become famous. Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya in his paper Govindānanda the least appreciated Bengal Nibandhakāra' (in JOR, Madras, Vol. XXIX for 1963 pp. 101-107 ) blames me for not mentioning ( in the first edition of the H. of Dh. vol. I) all the years in which intercalary months occurred near about Govindananda's time and for not making use of a verse ( quoted below) about the compo sition of the work of Govindananda's father contained in the editor's Preface to the Varsakriyakaumudi. I must enter a protest against these references to my not dilating on matters occurring even in prefaces to editions. I had to deal in H. of Dh. with more than one hundred authors in less than 500 pages. I could not indulge in long discussions as one can do in papers in journals. Even without referring to the date in the preface to Varşakriya kaumudi I placed Govindānanda between 1500-1540 A. D. Dr. Bhattacharya himself (in J. O. R. Madras, Vol. XXIX pp. 101-107 at p. 103) holds that my conclusion (in H. of Dh. vol. I 1930 on p. 415 ) we shall be very near the truth if Govindā

nanda's literary activity be placed between 1500 and 1540 A. D.' was justified. My reason for stating only a few intarcalary months was to find out the latest dates ( which Govindananda cited) for arriving at the date of composition of that work (Suddhi kaumudi). Dr. Bhattacharya is not quite accurate when he says on p. 500 of his paper on the Varsakriyakaumudi of Govinda nanda in Adyar Library Bulletin (Vol. XXV pp. 505-510 ) that Dr. Hazra's paper on 'works and period of literary activity of Govindananda' (J. O. R. Madras, Vol. XVIII pp. 97-108 ) has settled with certainty Govindananda's date as 1510-40 A. D. The only settled date ( if at all) is that of the composition of Jyotişmati ( an astronomical work of which only a single ms. is said to have been found) of Ganapatibhatta (written in 4613 Kaliyuga i. e. about 1512-13 A. D.). Dr. Hazra towards the end of his paper (pp. 107–108 ) relies on the three epithets (of self praise ) applied to Ganapatibhatta by himself viz, whose name was famous (prasiddhāhvayah), who was superior on account of his well known qualities (khyataguņottara) and the leader among astronomers. There is nothing to show that all these epithets were really deserved. There is nothing to show that the epithet 'bhatta ' had been conferred upon him. Further, we do not know whether a son had already been born to him about or before 1512 or whether the son was 10 or 20 or 40 years old at the time. 
It may be noted that Govindānanda himself was loose in giving the names of some of his own works; for example, the 5th Introductory verse in his work on Dāna employs the word “Dana kriyākaumudi', while the verse preceding the last one in the same work employs the word Dànakaumudi'. Similarly, the fifth Introductory verse of the Sraddhakaumudi has . Sri-Govindakavih karoti gahanām Śräddhakriyakaumdim', while at the end of the same work he says 'Govindānandakstinā kȚteyam Śrāddha kaumudi'. But as regards the Suddhikaumudi the Introductory verse is Śri Govindakaviḥ karoti gahanām śuddher-imām kaumudim' and at the end we have the verse 'Ganapatibhatta tavyo Govindānanda panditah sriman / samakstā santosārtham sudhiyam Sri Suddhi-kaumudim-etām'll. 
The Dànakriyakaumudi mentions ro other Kaumudi but is itself mentioned by Śråddhakriyakaumudi on pp. 340 and 529 and 
106. Govindananda 
885 
by Suddhikaumudi on p. 160 and by the Varsakriya-Kaumudi on pp. 352, 487. The Sraddhakaumudi mentions the Dànakaumudi on pp. 340 and 529 and the Suddhikaumudi on pp. 323, 342, 348, 440 and 483 and is mentioned by the Varșakriyakaumudi1338 on pp. 352, 487. The suddhikaumudi mentions the Dànakaumudi on p. 160 and is mentioned by the Varsakriyakaumudi on p. 359. The Varşakriyakaumudi mentions all the other three works as stated above but is not quoted by any of the other three Kaumudis and therefore it is the latest among his four works. 
On pp. 266-267 of the Suddhikaumudi it is stated by Govindananda that in 1414 sake ( i. e. 1492 A. D.) Vaišākha was intercalary, in sake 1416 (1494 A, D.) Bhadrapada was so, in śake 1419 ( 1497 A. D.) Sravana was intercalary in the 36th month from the time when an intercalary month occurred before that year and it remarks that there is not certain rule about these intercalary months, except this that an intercalary month does occur in the 3rd solar year after the occurrence of an intercalary month in some year. Then on p. 270 he quotes a Jyotişa verse and states that in sake 1449 (1527 A. D.) there was an intercalary month, Asadha, that in 1452 šake Vaišākha was an intercalary month, then in 1454 sake ( 1532 A. D.), Bhadrapada was an inter calary month and in 1457 sake ( 1535 A. D.) there was Śràvana as intercalary month and remarks that all this about intercalary months is not certain, but it is only prāyika ( probable). 
The learned editor of the Varsakriyakaumudi appends in the Preface (PP. III-V) a list of fourteen matters on which Govinda nanda differs from Raghunandana. Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya in his paper on the Varsakriyākauniudi (Adyar Library Bulletin, Vol. XXV on pp. 506-507) gives (on the fourteen points of difference between the two great scholars ) references to the pages of Varşakriy, and of the Tattvas on Ekādasī, Kộtya and Tithi. 
The Śrăddhakriyakaumudi mentions Sūlapāņi several times (on pp. 31, 71, 138, 374, 380, 549) and once on p. 71 includes him along with Aniruddha among the ancient ones ( vid note 1263

above prācāmasammatam ). “Prácảm' may also mean eastern but that meaning would not be proper here, since Aniruddha, Śūlapāņi and Govindananda are all men from Bengal. It men tions the Śrāddhacintămapi of Vacaspati sixteen times and often says that its opinion deserves to be rejected (heyam or apāstam ) as on p. 354 or is stupid (mandam) as on pp. 185, 280, 296, 319. 
Govindānanda wrote a learned and extensive commentary called Tattvarthakaumudi on the Prayascittaviveka of Sūlapāņi. The verse describing his father's attainments in Astronomy, Vedānta and Smstis also occurs there. On p. 142 of that com mentary he holds an elaborate discussion on the Holākadhikarana (Jaimini's Sūtras I. 3. 15-23) and he finds fault with Jimüta vahana's interpretation of it in the Dayabhaga. Vide H. of Dh. vol. V. Pp. 237–241 and 1281-82. It is not possible (for reasons of space ) to say more about the Tattvarthakaumudi here. 
Apart from his com. on Sūlapàni's work the four Kaumudis cover over 1800 printed pages. His is a great effort and is next to Raghunandana's Smstitattva in extent. 
Raghunandana does not mention him by name or his works nor does Govindānanda refer to Raghupandana or his works or views. Govindānanda appears to be the earlier of the two, though they were contemporaries. 
Govindānanda mentions Śrīdharasvămin, the famous com mentator of the Bhagavatapurāņa, in Varsakriyakaumudi (p. 56) and declares that a certain verse (kalārdhâm dvadasīm dệstvā &c.) quoted by him appears to be amúla (baseless ), while Raghu nandana also quotes him (i. e. Sridharasvāmin ) in (vol. I) Tithi 107, Prayascitta 517 (refers to his commentary on the 12th adhyāya of the 10th Skandha ), ( vol. II ) Ekadasi 25, Kịtya 430 (Sridharasvāmi-vyākhyānam-atra grāhyam ). 
On p. 559 of the Sraddba-kriyakaumudi, while dealing with Śrāddha in honour of ancient sages like Sanaka and the use of the word 'hanta' therein, Govindānanda remarks the rite (offering sråddha to Sanaka and others) may be seen in Kriya kaumudi'. Several explanations of these words are possible viz. that it is a marginal note introduced by scribes in the text or that Kriyakaumudi is a work of Govindananda himself or that Kriyakaumudi is a work by some other author. Raghunandana 
I 
106. Govindananda 
887 
(in Ābnikatattva, 343) quotes two verses from Kriyākaumudi (attributed to Vasistha ) that enumerate seven trees or plants called • tặnaraja' and condemns the use of the skins or leaves of those trees for ' dantadhāvana' and on p. 344 cites a verse from Kriyākaumudi that requires that if a man knowingly touches a jalaukā ( leech) or si.nilar worm he should forbear from perform ing daily religious duties ( unless he bathes or washes the hands ). On p. 376 of Ăhnikatattva Raghu, quotes a half verse from Kaumudi1337 forbidding for tarpana the use of water taken from a sūdra or water falling from clouds. 
It appears that the Bengal Asiatic Society has a ms. of a work called Kriyakaumudi.1338 I learn from Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya that Dr. Shrimati Vani Chakravarti in her recently published Bengali work (in July 1964) named 'samaja-saṁskāraka Raghunandana' has shown that all the quotations from Kriya kaumudi found in Raghunandana's Smộtitattva ( which are only four or rather 3 verses) can be identified in the ms, of Kriya kaumudi belonging to the Bengal Asiatic Society. Those quotations by Raghunandana appear, according to Dr. Miss. Vani, on folios 7, 8 and 34 of the A. S. Ms. of Kriyakaumudi. Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya assures me (from personal examina tion of the ms.) that the prayoga alluded to in p. 559 of the Sraddhakriyakaumudi occurs on folio 36 of the ms. (in the Asiatic Society). This makes the conclusion certain that the Kriyākaumudi was a work of Govindānanda. There is evidence in the Suddhikaumudi that he describes the details of a subject in one Kaumudi (viz. on Dina) and sets out the mere prayoga in another work (viz. in Suddhikaumudi). 
Dr. Hazra in J. O. R. (Madras) Vol. XXIII pp. 97-108 sets out all the works of Govindānanda (eleven in all) with some 
1337 
1338 
It is difficult to say why the quotation on p. 376 is cited from 
Kaumudi' and not from 'Kriyākaumudi', while the other two are cited from Kriyākaumudi. 
The beginning of the Kriyakaumudi (in the ms, of the A. S. of Bengal) is : sthaariralamees Tetera: sitifaceta: करोति विदुषां कृत्यां क्रियाकौमुदीम् । कविकङ्कणपण्डितः पितुश्चरणाम्भोजयुगोप

details in each case and holds (pp. 99-101) that the Kriya kaumudi (m. in Sraddbakriyakaumudi p. 559) is his (Govindā nanda's ) work. 
The learned editor of the Varsakriyakaumudi (M. M. Kamalakrisna Smộtitirtha ) stated clearly in his Introduction to Varsakriyakaumudi (page 1) that the author Govindānanda lived in the village of Bågri in the Midnapure District, that he was a devout Vaişpava ( as appears from the Introductory verses of the Varșakriyakaumudi and his other works ), that some of the paścătya vaidikas of the Gautama family assert that they are descendants of Gapapati-bhatta and Pandit Haranchandra Tarka vagisa of Bagri (who supplied to the editor the date of the Jyotismatī) traced his descent from Ganapatibhatta (p. lll of Introduction ). The eminent scholar M. M. Dr. Haraprasad Sastri in the Preface to his Descriptive Cat. of Sanskrit Mss. vol. III (published by the Asiatic Society of Calcutta in 1925) made two statements which are inaccurate. One statement was that at the end of the 15th century a leader of the foreign bråhmaņas settled in the outskirts of Bengal in the district of Bankura, wrote a code for the brāhmaṇas of his own persuasion entitled Varşa kriyākaumudi, complete in six books; (p. XXI). The second inaccurate statement was that Govindananda Kavikavkaņācārya was a Dravida Brāhmana settled in the District of Bankura in Bengal and that he wrote a comprehensive work entitled Kriya kaumudi of which Dānakriya and Varsakriyà are represented in Nos. 2691 and 2692 (of the Society's mss. ). One mistake is that the so-called code is called Varsakriyākaumudi and another is that it is in six books. It is one of his books (and not the whole code) that is called Varșakriyakaumudi and the code is not in six books but only in four (or at the most in five). There is nothing to show that Drāvida brāhmaṇas settled in West Bengal in the 14th century. The only probable migration might have been from Kanoj (which can be described as being to the west of Bengal). 
I am inclined to hold that the Kriyakaumudi is Govinda nanda's work. He had already given some directions about the śråddha in honour of Sanaka ( and other sages on pp. 557-58 ) and therefore added that the detailed procedure of Sanaka's Srāddha would be found in Kriyakaumudi. The note below 
106. Govindananda 
889 
collects in one place some references to the pages of detailed procedures mentioned in his works. In this case he did not like to dwell long on Sanakàdiśraddha (which was a daily one) and referred to another work for details. It would be noticed that (in some cases mentioned in the note )1339 he expressly says that he has already explained some matters in another work and uses the words ' asmàbhiḥ' and 'vivecanam..krtam &c. 
For information about Govindananda vide JASB (New Series) Vol. XI for 1915 pp. 351–57. His Suddhi-kaumudi exam ines intercalary months 1340 from sake 1414 to śake 1457 (i. e. from 1492 A. D. to 1535 A. D.). Therefore it appears that he wrote his Suddhikaumudi immediately after sake 1457 (i. e. 1535 A. D.). He wrote the Sraddha-kaumudi and Varşa-kriyākaumudi after the Suddhikaumudi. Therefore we shall be very near the truth if his literary activity be placed between 1500 and 1540 A. D.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
107. Raghunandana 
Raghunandana is the last great writer of Bengal on dharma śāstra. He compiled an encyclopædic work on the different branches of dharmaśāstra styled Smộtitattva, divided into 28 sections called tattvas. He cites the names of over 300 authors and works in his encyclopaedia, which have been collected together by M. M, Chakravarti (JASB for 1915 pp. 363-375). His wonderful mastery over smrti material and his erudition displayed in the Smsti-tattva earned for him the appellation smärtabhattācārya or simply smärta' from later writers. For example, the Vīramitrodaya refers to him in that way and so does Nilakantha in his Vyavahāramayukha,1341 His Smộtitattva was printed at Serampore in Bengali characters so far back as 1834 35 A, D. The Smrtitattva was published by Jivananda in 1895 (in two volumes ) in 1631 pages. Out of 28 tattvas the Rgvedi vssotsargatattva is not included in Jivananda's edition; but for a brief note on Ķgvedivisotsargata ttva, vide Mitra's Notices, vol. VII p. 119 No. 2349 ( which follows the procedure laid down by Saunaka). The Srāddhatattva (in Jivananda's ed. vol. I. pp. 189– 325) is really Sāmasrāddhatattva, since Raghunandana being a Bengali Rādhiya brāhmaṇa was a Sāmavedin. He begins by quoting in the very first lines of this part Gobhila : 'Atha Pārvapaśrāddham tatra Gobhilāḥ \ Atha śrăddham amāvāsyā yām pitrbhyo dadyat'. On many pages he quotes Gobhila grhysütra, as on pp. 195 (twice ), 196, 203, 207, 209, 210, 213, (twice ), 218, 228, 233 (twice ), 235 ( several times ), 238, 240, 242, 245, 259, 273 ( five lines quoted ), 282, 288, (6 lines ), 307 ( 6 lines ). The Tithitattva ( in Jivananda's edition) men tions on p. 93 (vol. I) a Durgāpūjātattva (pūjāyām visesastu Durgāpājātattveşvasandheyah) and at the end of the 2nd vol. of Jivananda's edition there is Sri-Durgārcanapaddhati, which is the same as the Durgā pūjā-prayogatattva published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parişad, Calcutta. He wrote also a Tirtha

yātratattva, dealing only with pilgrimages to Gayà, 1342 Prayaga and Vārāṇasī. He also wrote a commentary on the Dayabhāga. It has also been published by Jivananda (in two volumes ). Some tattvas have been separately published as e. g. the Vyavahå ratattva and the Dayatattva (published at Calcutta in 1828 by the Department of Public Instruction). His Dảyatattya was translated into English by Golapcandra Sarkar in his Mala måsatattva the names of his tattvas are given.1343 Vide Mitra's Notices, vol. III. p. 50 No. 1081 and 1. O. Cat. p. 420 No. 1405 for an enumeration of the tattvas and for reference to the volumes and pages in the Serampore edition. The tattyas are not arranged in the verses quoted below according to their chronological order, but according to the exigencies of the metre. In this work I have used Jivananda's edition.

We have to under. stand the word Pratişthã as meant for Devapratişthā only ( vol. II pp. 502-513 ) and that the word “Talagabhavanot sarga' in the note is meant both for "Jalāśayotsargattva' (vol. II. pp. 513-528 ) and Mathapratisthādi' (vol. II pp. 613-633).

History of Dharmaśāstra 
It is not feasible to give even brief sammaries of Raghu nandana's tattvas. Their very names indicate the subject matter. But one of them, the Dayatattva, deserves special mention. It treats of partition made by father, partition among brothers after their father's death, persons not entitled to a share, property not liable to partition, evidence of separation, stridhana and its devolution, inheritance to one dying sonless etc. His Tithitattva contains a description in Sanskrit of the game called Caturanga played on the full moon of Aśvina by four players. Vide (in vol. I) Tithi-tattva pp. 137–139 ( for a description of 'catu rangakridana). 
Besides the 28 tattvas Raghunandana is said to have com posed several other works. There is a commentary on the Daya bhäga attributed to him. Colebrooke suspected its genuineness, but the colophon of the commentary1314 gives the same details about Raghunandana as are found in his admitted works. It is to be noticed that the Dayatattva of Raghunandana sets forth the same principles of Hindu law that are peculiar to Jimütavahana, though in matters of detail they disagree in a few cases. The Viramitrodaya styles the author of the Dāyatattva a follower of Jimūtavāhana.1345 It has been held by the Calcutta High Court that Raghunandana's is the best commentary on the Dāyabhāga and that the authority of Raghunandana is acknow ledged and respected universally in the Bengal School.1346 
Besides the above, Raghunandana wrote also Tirthatattva or Tirthayatrāvidhitattva, the Dvadaśayātrātattva (on the princi pal festivals at Jagannāthapuri, one in each month ), Tripuskara sānti-tattva, Gayāśrāddhapaddhati and Räsayātrāpaddhati. His works however are not very much in vogue elsewhere than in Bengal. 
Raghunandana was the son of Hariharabhatticàrya and was a Bengal Vandyaghațiya Bråhmaņa. He was a pupil of Srinàtha. ācārya-cúdāmaņi, whose works are frequently quoted in the

several tattvas ( vide Chakravarti in JASB for 1915 p. 351 n. 2). According to tradition Raghunandana and the great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya were pupils of the same teacher, Vasudeva Sárva. bhauma, who was the shining light of the new logic (navyanyāya) at Navadvipa and were residents of that place (Sarvadhikari's Tagore Law Lectures, first edition p. 403 ff.). 
Among the authors and works quoted in his encyclopaedia by Raghunandana those noted below deserve mention 1347 
In the Malamāsatattva, after citing the names of the tattvas and mentioning the topics to be dealt with in Malamàsatattva, he states (vol. I. p. 738 lines 1-2) that he is writing the work after looking into many nibandhas (nibandhan bahudbālocya nibadhyante satām mude). It may be noted further that he enumerates the names of the 18 Puráras from the Visņupuråpa (III. 6. 21-23) and quotes from the Kurma the names of 18 upapuranas (in Smrtitattva, vol. I. pp. 792-93). Raghunandana profusely quotes all the 18 Puranas, but the Upapuranas are sparingly cited except the Adi, Aditya, Kalika, Devi, Nandikes vara, Narasimha, Naradiya. 
In may be noted that Raghunandana in Malamāsatattva (vol. I. p. 792) quotes a passage accepted by great people (or by many people ) viz. "Śūdras are Vājasaneyins in all matters and should follow the procedure laid down by the sages of that

Veda'.1348_In another place i.e. in the Sudrakrtyavicaranatattva (vol. II. p. 634) he quotes the passage Arsakramena sarvatra &c.' and remarks that the muntra to be recited is to be taken from the Grhya relating to Yajurveda. The Smrti of Yājñavalkya (I. 121 )1349 provides that he ( the sudra) should perform the five daily yajñas to the accompaniment of the word 'namaḥ' as the mantra. The Mitaksara on Yaj. I. 121 says the same thing and adds that the sūdra should perform five daily yājñas to the accompaniment of the word 'Namaskāra' as the Mantra and then states that some prescribed a mantra for Śūdras as noted in the footnote1350. This establishes that at least in some parts of India Sudras could even in the 11th century A. D. repeat a mantra cited in the note below. It appears that the opposite view viz. that a sudra could repeat only the word 'namaskara' as a mantra had begun to be emphasized in the IIth century A. D. and had been prescribed some centuries before Christ in some works such as the Gautama-Dharinasūtra (X. 66 'anujña tosya namaskāro mantrah'). 
How the attitude of our learned writers towards women and śūdras went on becoming stiffer and stiffer may be very briefly indicated here. In the daily tarpana ( satiating by offering water ) three women are included in the tarpana of sages viz. Gärgi

Vacaknavi, Vadavi Pritithevi and Sulabha Maitreyi' (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 691). Further, in the BỊliadārāņayakopanişad, the great sage Yājñavalkya imparts to his wife Maitreyi the know ledge of brahman ( Br. Up. II. 4-5). Sankarācārya1351 on Brahmasutra I. 3. 38 quotes a portion of Santiparva 328. 49 for establishing that Smrti declares that men of all four varnas have the right (or privilege ) to acquire knowledge of Itihasa and Puranas. The Dharmasindhul352 says (p. 77) 'Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have the privilege (or capacity) to perform rajasapijā containing offerings of flesh and to perform japa and homa; simil arly, in the case of sidras, tāmasapījà without mantras and japa with offerings of even flesh is allowed, but the Sättvikapājā consisting of japa of saptašati and homa should be got performed through brāhmaṇas, ( since ) sudras and women have no privilege of reciting even the mantras from Puriņas and that in the bhâsya (conimentary) on the words the sūdra may secure happiness', it has been said that the sadra reaps the fruit of religious rites viz. merely by listening to the mantras and not by repeating the mantras himself; therefore it should be unders stood that the sūdra secures the desired fruits (results) of religious rites by merely listening to the Purāņi mantras and not by himself reciting them; from this it should be understood that personal recitation by women and sūdras of the Gità and the thousand names of Vişnu would lead to sin in their case.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
dictum of the Darmasindhu is opposed to that of Gita1363 itself (IX. 32) and the words of Sankarācārya who places the Südras on the same footing as the three Varnas. 
The Bhagavatapurâņa 354 (I. 4. 25) expressly states. As the three vedas cannot reach the ears of (i. e. are not or cannot be studied by) women, sūdras and those who are merely somhow related to the twice-born, the sage (Vyāsa ) composed the Bharata story (i. e. the epic Mahabharata) out of compassion for them'. Some writers from Mithilā, says Raghunandana in Rūdrakrtyavicāranatattva (vol. II, p. 635), held that in srāddhas a sudra could repeat a Purāņa mantra; to this Raghunandana replies that the Varaha and Matsya Puràņas are opposed to this.1355 The result would be that there is an option, the Mahābhārata can be studied by women and sūdras just as men of the first three varnas study the Veda. Even granting that some Puràņas like the Matsya and Varāha are opposed to this, that does not matter. There would be an option as the Bhagavata purāņa states that the Mahābhārata takes the place of Veda in the case of women and sūdras, while some Puranas deny this in certain matters. 
Aufrecht placed Raghunandana between 1430-1612 A. D. Dr. Jolly (Tagore Law Lectures p. 10) places him early in the 16th century. In I. L. R. 48 Cal. 643 (F. B.) at p. 695 it is said that Raghunandana belongs to the latter half of the 15th century. As Raghunandana's works are quoted and criticised by the Virami trodaya (pp. 79, 531, 683, 697, 703 etc.,) and by Nilakantha, Raghunandana is certainly earlier than 1600 A. D. As he names Madhavācārya, Sūlapāņi, Răyamukuta, Rudradhara and Vacaspati, he is later than about 1500 A. D. If tradition is to be believed that he was a fellow-student of Caitanya he must have been born about 1490 A. D. Caitanya is said to have been born in 1485

or 1486 A. D.1368 In his Jyotistattva he mentions śake 14211887 in connection with the position of Vișuva. That shows that the work was not composed probably very much long after that date (i. e. 1499-1500 A. D.). In the same Tattva (vol. I. p. 568) for calculating ravi-saņkrānti he takes sake 1489 as the basis (i. e. 1567 A. D.). So that Tattva was composed just about that year. A ms. of the Chandoga-śrāddha-tattva was copied in sake 1497 (1575–76 A. D.)1358 and a ms. of the Matha pratisthà-tattva was copied in sake 1498 (i. e. 1576–77 A. D.).1358 Therefore he must have flourished before 1575. Raghuandana, as shown above at some length (on pp. 853–54) very often criti cizes Vācaspati, whose literary activities have been placed above between 1450-1480 A. D. Besides, Nārāyaṇabhatta, who was born in 1513 A. D. (as will be shown under Nārāyaṇabhatta ) and was the paternal grandfather of the famous cousins Kamalakara ( who composed the Nirnayasindhu in 1612 A. D.) and Nilakantha, is mentioned with great respect as Bhatta nārāyaṇacaranāḥ "1360 by Raghuanandana in (vol. I) Tithitattva (pp. 99-100), Srāddhatattva (pp. 201, 245), Saṁskāratattva pp. 868, 878 ( in vol. II ). Suddhitattva (p. 251 ). Therefore Nàråyanabhatta must have been an honoured contemporary of Raghunandana. The latter very rarely differs (if at all) from Nārāyanabhatta and never employs words like heyam' or ' nirastam' about Nārāyaṇabhatta's views ( as Raghu. does in the case of Vācaspati). So Raghunandana may be said to have flourished between 1510--1580 A. D. It may be noted that the Nirņayasindhu ( 2nd. Pari. p. 83) mentions the Tithitattva as quoting Kälikāpurāņa about bath in the waters of the Brahma

Raghunandana was a great writer with wide reading, a wonderful memory, patient industry and a logical mind. 
Several papers have been written about him. I have read some of them. The following may be mentioned. 
1. J. A. S. B. New Series, Vol. XI, pp. 351-357 by M. M. Chakravarti, with an Index of Writers and Works in English characters (pp. 363-375) based on the text in the Serampore edition of 27 tattvas (omitting 'Rgvssotsaraga-tattva') published in 1834–35). This index loses much of its usefulness because very few libraries in modern India have got the very old Seram pore edition and the only procurable edition now for many is that of Jivananda's. The present author had to spend weeks over preparing an index of authors and works by reference to the pages of the edition of Jivananda.

The Tattvas in the Smộtitattva enable us to see clearly, what subjects falling under Dharmaśāstra had assumed importance and gripped people's minds in the 16th century A. D. and a few centuries before. The Tattvas1362 are arranged here in the order of the number of pages devoted to each tattva in Raghunan dana's Smộtitativa. (1 ) Tithi 188 pages (vol. I pp. 1-188); 2 Suddhi, 180 pages, (vol. II. pp. 233–412); 3 Jyotistattva pp. 177 (vol. I pp. 559–735); 4. Áhnika, 140 pp. (vot. I pp. 326-465); 5. Sraddha 137 pp. ( vol. I. pp. 189-325); 6. Malamāsa pp. 121 (vol. I pp. 736-856); 7. Ekadasi pp. 105 (vol. II pp. 1-105); 8. Prayaścitta pp. 93 (vol. I pp. 466-558 ); 9. Saṁskāra pp. 92 (vol. I pp. 587-948); 10. Kętya p. 60 (vol. II. Pp. 423-483 ); 11. Udvaha pp. 45 ( vol. II pp. 106-150 ); 12. Divya pp. 40 (vol. II. pp. 574-613); 13. Dāya, pp. 36 (vol. II pp. 161-197); 14. Vyavahāra pp. 36 ( vol. II pp. 197-233 ); 15. Chandogavssotsarga pp. 34 (vol. II pp. 528–562; 16. Yajurvediśrăddha pp. 20 pp. 613-633); 17. Mathapratisthà pp. 20 (vol. II pp. 613-633); 18. Jalāśayotsarga pp. 15 (vol. JI pp. 513-528 ); 19.

(Continued from the previous page) shed by the Calcutta Asiatic Society in 1955 ) he has exhau stively dealt with the Bhagavadgita quotations on pp. 50-51. He is sometimes uncharitable when dealing with others as (e. g) when he says on p. 225 of Siddhabhārati,' part I “Though Prof. P. V, Kane and Dr. S. K. Dey have occasionally repeated the fact of particular digest-writers having been quoted by Raghunandana from the above-mentioned list of Chakravarti, yet, far from identifying the quotations, they have nowhere even mentioned the fact of the Bhagavadgitā or the Srimad Bhagavata baving'been quoted by Raghunandana". The History of Dharınaśästra vol. I (published in 1930), contains only 466 pages on details of about 113 authors and their works and it was irrelevant and absolutely unnecessary to say anywhere in the History of Dh. (vol. I) that the verses from the Gită had been mentioned by a writer of the 16th century. It may be noted that the Kșspajan māştami-tattva is included in Tithitattva ( pp. 41-54 ). So also the Durgāpūjā-tattva has been dealt with in Tithitattva (pp. 64-104 ) which has at the end the words 'Durgāpujātattvam samāptam'. The Durgar canapaddhati at the end of the 2nd volume (pp. 659-683 ) is pot Durgāpūjā tattva; it is the additional matter.

(vol. II pp. 645-658); 20. Devapratișthà, pp. 12 (vol. II pp. 502-513); 21. Vastuyāga, pp. 12 ( vol. II pp. 412-423 ); 22. Sri puruşottama, pp. 11 (vol. II pp. 563–573); 23. Vrata, pp. 10 (vol. II pp. 151-160); 24. Yajurvedi-Vţsotsarga, pp. 9 (vol. II pp. 636-644); 25. Sudrakstya-vicāraņa pp.4 (vol. II pp. 633-636); 26. Durgārcanapaddhati pp. 659-683. It would be noticed that religious duties on the different tithis of the year occupy, as regards extent, the first place; then comes Suddhi (āsauca on death and impurity on birth ), then astronomical and astrologi cal matters, then ähnika (the daily religious duties ), then Śrà ddhas, then religious duties in intercalary month. It may be noticed that inheritance and partition cover only 36 pages and so do administration of justice, substantive and procedural law; and ordeals are assigned more pages than even Dāya and Vyavahāra. 
The first volume of the tattvas (Jivananda's edition) con tains only nine tattvas in 948 pages, while the second volume of 683 pages contains 18 tattvas. There is hardly anything to prove or to show that this was Raghunandan's own arrange ment. Probably it is due to modern editors. There is some internal evidence to establish the order in which at least some of the tattvas were composed. For example, pursuing the San skrit alphabetical order of the names, the following brief state ment is made. 
Of the tattvas (1) the Āhnika was composed before Srà ddha ( vide p. 233 of Śr. ), while Āhnika (p. 375) mentions Suddhi as already composed; (2) The Udváha was composed before Samskära (vol. I p. 884) and after Suddhi (vol. II p. 107) and after Dayatattva ( vol. II, p. 127); (3) The Ekādasi was composed before Tithi ( vol. I pp. 6 and 150 ), before Malamāsa, ( as Ekādasi vol. II p. 19 says • Vaksyate'). 4. Chandoga-Vrsot sarga was written after Suddhi (vol. II p. 532); (5) Jyotis. was composed after Ma'amāsa (vol. I p. 775); ( 6 ) Tithi was written after Ekadasi (vide vol. I pp. 6, 150), after Suddhi and Sriddha (p. 15 vol. I), after Malamāsa (vol. I, Tithi pp. 152, 167); 
These figures do not refer to the number of the tattvas but only count the tattvas that refer to priority or posteriority among themselves.107. Raghunandana 
901 
(7) Dāyatattva was composed before Udvāha (vol. II p. 127) and after Suddhi (vol. II pp. 190-197); (8) Divya. was composed before Vyavahāra (vol. II p. 211); (9) Durgāpůjā mentioned by Tithitattva (vol. I p. 93 as 'as anusandheyah') does not show priority or posteriority; (10) Malamāsa was composed after Jyotistattva (vol. I p. 775 ) and after Sräddha and Udváha (vol. I p. 884); (11) Vyavahāra was written after Divyattattva (vol. II p. 228); ((12) Suddhi was composed before Tithi (vol. I p. 15) and after Ekādasi. (vol. II, p. 307) and also before Udvāha (vol. II p. 107); (13) Sraddha was composed before Tithi (vol. I p. 15 ) and Sanskāra (vol. I p. 884) and after Ábnika (Sraddha vol. I p. 233 ); (14) Samskāra was com posed before Chandogavssotsargatattva (vol. II pp. 543–547) and after Sraddha and Udvāha (vol. I p. 884). 
Another method which may be briefly indicated for finding the order in which the tattvas were composed is as follows: One may say that when Raghu says about a topic that it has been vivrta' (expounded) or 'prapañcita' (dealt with in detail) or uses past passive participles of the same meaning, one may reasonably hold that that subject had been already dealt with in a tattya. But when he uses words like 'anusandheyam (may be consulted) or jeyam ( may be known or understood from ) a conclusion about priority or posteriority cannot be reasonably drawn. A very learned man (particularly before the advent of printing) may have been engaged in or contemplating the composition of two or three works at the same time and one day he might write a chapter of one book and the next day or a few days later he might compose a chapter for another work of his by way of change or variety. Therefore, the words 'anusandheyam' and 'jõeyam’ may be employed with reference to a work already composed or yet to be composed. 
The present author holds that the mention of 28 tattvas contained at the beginning of the Malamäsatattva1303 was only a draft (of the tattvas to be described ) prepared at some time before Raghunandana began to describe the several tattvas. It 
1363 Why the intercalary Month is called Malimluca is stated by 
Raghu in Malamāsatattva, Vol. I p. 768 as ' mali gan mlocati gacchatīti unalimlucah '. 
902 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
appears that some tattvas at least had been composed before the Malamāsatattva was actually written. For example the Malamāsa. (vol. I p. 834) quotes Manu IV. 103 (vidyut-stanita &c.) and adds that it was explained in Tithitvttva. On p. 775 (vol. I) the Malamāsa expressly says. Tajjyotiḥśảstroktakala...iti Jyotistattve-bahudhå vivítam'. From the Ekādasitattva (vol. II p. 19) it appears that the Malamāsatattva was yet to be composed when the former was composed (evam ca Gobbilā nukteşvannaprāšanādişu yad-Vțddhiếrāddham tan-malamāsatattve mātsyapurāņādivacanād vaksyate'. The most extensive tattvas are (as shown in detail above) those on Tithi, śuddhi, Jyotis, Ähnika and Sraddha, whereas Malamāsa comes only next to these five in extent. 
Raghunandana was a master in the application of the Mimàm sāsūtras and Nyāyas. I shall only mention a few of the most important pages where Jaimini's sötras are actually cited; (in vol. I. Tithi 95 and Sraddha 221 definitions of ?k, yajus, sāma); Ābnika (p. 338 ); Prayas, p. 479 ( Jai. III. 4. 17), 480 ( Jai. I. 2.1) Malamāsa (p. 806 ), Ekādasi p. 88 and p. 97 ( Jaimini VI. 3. 18 ). Raghunandana employs two kinds of Nyāyas viz. those based on the discussions in Jaimini and the explanations given by his commentators and nyāyas (maxims) that are more or less of a popular nature. A few examples of the two kinds may be mentioned by way of illustration. Two nyayas of the first type cited by Raghu. may be mentioned as examples. There is 'Sam yogapěthaktvanyāya (based on Jaiminisätra IV. 3. 5-7 which is mentioned and explained by Raghu, in Tithi (vol. I p. 44), Pr. T. (vol. I pp. 474–475) and (also in vol. II ) Ekadasi pp. 29–30. Another well-know Nyāya is Sarvašakhåpratyaya-nyāya (Jaimini II. 4.8-33). Raghu, relies on it in (vol. II ) Suddhi p. 378. Ex amples of a popular sort of nyāyas are Gobalivardanyāya that occurs (in vol. I Tithi p. 142) and Dandapúpanyaya (that occurs in Dāyatattva, vol. II. p. 170); vide H. of Dh. vol. V pp. 1343, 1344 for the elucidation of these two and pp. 1339-1351 for over 171 ayāyas explained briefly.

108 Nārāyaṇabhatta 
Nārāyaṇabhatta 1364 was the most famous of the celebrated family of the Bhattas of Benares. For a biography of the Bhātta 
1364 
The work of Sankarabhatta is called Gadhi-vamśānucarita. The first leaf of the ms, is missing and the work comes abruptly to an end. Even in ancient times there appears to have been 
a rivalry between the two great sages of the ægveda viz. Vasiştha (to whom and his family are ascribed the verses in the VII Mandala of the Rgveda ) and Viśvāmitra (to whom are ascribed the verses of the 3rd Mandala of the same Veda ). It appears from æg. III. 53. 9-12 that Viśvāmitra's ancestor was Kuśika and that his prayers helped Bhārata people. At least as early as the Mahābhāsya (vol. II p. 254 of Kielhorn's ed.) of Patañjali ( on Pāņ IV.1.101 ) the pedi gree was Kuśika-Gādhi-Viśvāmitra. The name Gādbi does not occur in the Rgveda, The Mabābhārata and some of the Purāņas are full of stories about the rivalry between Viśvā mitra and Vasiştha. For enmity (vaira ) between the two sages, vide Ādi chap. 175-176, Chitrashala ed. The gotra of the family was Viśvāmitra and the family is known as Gādhivamśa. In Rg. III, 33. 5 Viśvāmitra is said to be sūnu (son) of Kusika. The plural of Kuśika ocourg frequently in the Rg. Sarkarabhatta also composed a work called Dvaitanirnaya, an account of which contributed by the present author will be found in ABORI vol. III pp. 67-72 ( for 1921-22 ). The Gădhivaišānucarita of Sarkarabhatta does not mention the fact of the re-establishment of Viśveśvara by bis father Nārāyaṇabhatta. It is later descendants of Nārāyaṇabhatta that refer to this deed of Nārāyaṇabhatta. It is possible that Sankarabhatta wrote the Gādbivaman ucarita before the restoration of Visreśvara shrine. Nărāyaṇabhatta appears to have composed a work called 
jivac-chrāddhavidhi'( based on the Brahmapurāna and other works) enabling a person to perform his own śrāddha while he was alive. Vide Prof. G. V. Devasthali's Deg, Cat. of Sanskrit and Prakrit Mss, in the Library of the Bombay University No. 1045 p. 376 and Prof. Velankar's Des. Cat, of the Sanskrit Mss. in the Iccharam Desai Collection of the Bombay Universsty Nos. 292-294 pp. 60-61.

O. R. I. in 1926. From several references it appears that Nārāyaṇabhatta wrote a bhāşya on the Gobhila-gshya-sūtra; vide Smộtitattva (vol. 1 )-Tithi p. 14 ‘Kuśāntarapratinidhir-Bhattana rāyanair - Gobhila-bhāşya uktaḥ); Samskāratattva pp. 878 and 904; (vol. II) Udvahatattva p. 130. A few more examples of the use of the honorific plural Bhatta-Nārāyaṇacaranäh' by Raghu, may be added here. Vide (vol. I) Śråddha pp. 201, 245; Samskāra p. 868; (vol. II) Mathapratisthā 620, Suddhi 251. M. M. Haraprasad Sastri has broght to light a biography of this family written by Sarkarabhatta, a son of Nārāyaṇabhatta (Ind. Ant. for 1912 vol. 41, pp. 7-13). Nārāyanabhatta's father Rame svarabhatta whose gotra was Viśvāmitra migrated from Prati sthåna (Paithan ) in the Deccan to Benares. Ramešvarabhatta was a very learned man and his learning drew to him students from the whole of India. Nārāyaṇabhatta was born according to Šankarabhatta's biography in sake 1435 in the month of Caitra (i. e. about March 1513 A. D.). Nārāyaṇabhatta was the eldest of three sons, the other two being Sridhara and Madhava. Nårăyapabhațța learnt all the śāstras at the feet of his father. Pandits all over India looked up to him as their leader and patron and he was an assiduous collector of Sanskrit mss. It is said that Nārāyaṇabhatta brought down by his holiness rain in a season of drought and thereby induced the Mahomedan ruler that had razed the temple of Visvesvara at Benares to the

ground to allow him to rebuild it. For his erudition and piety Närāyaṇabhatta was honoured with the title “Jagadguru' and his family was given the first place of honour in the assembly of learned Brāhmaṇas and at the recitations of the Vedas. It was Nārāyaṇabhatta and bis equally worthy descendants that raised dā kşiņătya pandits to the position of high eminence at Benares which they still hold. Nårāyanabhatta wrote numerous works on dharmasastra among which may be mentioned the Antyestipaddhati ( printed by Nirnayasagara Press ), the Tristhali setu ( dealing with the ceremonies to be performed generally at all sacred places and particularly at Prayaga, Kāsi and Gaya) and the Prayogaratna (printed at the Nirnayasāgara Press, 1915 A. D.). This last contains detailed descriptions and rituals of the samskäras from garbhādhana to vivāha. His are standard works on the subjects they deal with and are used even now almost throughout the whole of India. He composed a com mentary on the introductory verses contained in the Kālamadhava ( vide Madras Triennial Cat. vol. III. Sanskrit C. p. 4114 No. 2852) and a commentary on portions of the Săstradipikā of Parthasarathimiśra. He composed a work on ordeals which is referred to in the Vyavahāratattva of Nilakartha (vide p. 457 of my edition of the Vyavahāramayukha and Bikaner cat. p. 387 No. 832 for a Divyānuşthāna-paddhati of Nårāyaṇabhatta) and also paddhatis on the dedication of gardens, tanks etc. For a Jalàsayotsargavidhi of Nārāyana, vide I. O. Cat. No. 1717 and Mitra's Notices V. p. 146 and Prof, Velankar's Cat. of the Bombay University's Desai Collection of Mss. pp. 41-42 No. 204. He exercised a profound influence over later writers directly and indirectly through his sons and grand-sons. Vide Cat. of India Office Sanskrit Mss. (part III p. 547 where the girl (T?) grafisa 578113 of Farm son of Acha says so) and Hultzsch's Report on South Indian Sanskrit mss. vol.

FYTYYTHTH 9:11 5th verse at the end of the work. 
Those interested in the several eminent writers of this gifted Bhatta family of Benares may refer to the present author's Introduction to the Vyavahāramayukha of Nilakaộtha (published 
H, D, 114 
906 
History of Dharmaśāstra 
by the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona, in 1926 pp. V-XXVII). Only a brief pedigree of the family is added here: 1366 
As he was born in 1513 A. D. and composed the commentary on the Vșttaratnākara in 1545 A. D., his literary activity must be placed between 1540 and 1570 A. D. This is further corrobora ted by the fact that his grandson Kamalakarabhatta composed the Nirnayasindhu, one of his earliest works, in 1612 A. D. 
It appears that Käntānàthabhatta, a descendant of Kamala karabhatta, published a work called 'Bhatta-vamsa-Kävyam' in 1903 at the Ananda-kadambini press of Mirzapur. Kântânātha Bhatta was head Pandit at the Sanskrit Pathasaļă at that place. In the Hindi Preface to that work he said that he saw Sankara bhatta's work called Gadhivañśavarnana and Mandlik's edition of the Vyavahāramayúkha and that induced him to write the work. It is in 10 sargas and contains 429 verses in several

metres. The pedigree he gives differs from Sankarabhatta's work in several respects. It is unnecessary to pursue this matter here. 
There is a work on dharmaśāstra called Dharmapravștti composed by a Nārāyaṇa. Mr. K. P. Jayasval holds that this was composed by jagadguru Nārāyaṇabhatta (JBORS for 1927, vol. XIII, parts III-IV, p. XI). The same view is held by M. M. Haraprasad Šāstri (Ind. Ant. for 1912 p. 7). Prof. Velankar in hjs Cat. of the Sanskrit Mss, in the Iccharam Suryaram Desai Collection of the Bombay University (p. 45) appears to identify Nārāyapa, author of Dharmapravștti (mss. No. 217 and 218 on p. 45) with the famous Nārāyanabhatta, author of Prayogaratna. But this identity is extremely doubtful. The benedictory verses1366 in the Dharmapravítti are diffierent from those of the Prayo garatna and Tristhalisetu, the method of treatment and the style are different and the colophons are also different. The author of the Dharmapravștti does not mention his ancestors as Nārāyaṇabhatta does. Nilakantha in his Vyavahäramayûkha finds 1387 fault with the Dharmapravịtti by saying that certain quotations therein are unauthoritative. 
109. Todarānanda 
Rājä Țodaramalla, the celebrated finance minister of Akbar, compiled an extensive encyclopædia of civil and religious law, astronomy and medicine. I gave in the first edition some in formation about this work gathered from several sources. No part of the work had been printed when the first edition of the first volume was published in 1930. In 1945 Pandit K. Madhav Krishna Sarma contributed a paper on Todarānanda to the Journal of the G. J. R. I. of Allahabad, vol. III. pp. 63-66. There he stated that the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner has the most complete set of the parts of the Țodarānanda. In 1948 Dr. P. L. Vaidya published a volume containing two parts of the text of the encyclopaedic work viz. on Sarga (creation of the

world) and Avatāras, in the Gangă Oriental Series of Bikaner with a Foreword by Sardar K. M. Panikkara (the then Prime Minister of the Bikaner State ), with a learned Introduction (by Dr. Vaidya), Text (in 386 pages) and some Appendices (Appendix A, giving a brief sketch of the life of Raja Todar mal, B containing a few stanzas glorifying Todarmal found in Manirăma's Padyasangraha and three verses from the Benares Draupadi-Kunda Inscription of Sarivat 1616 (i, e. 1589 A, D.) inscribed by order of Todarmal, Appendix C (pp. 395-414) supplying information on several sections of the Todarānanda derived from mss. in different libraries. 
Dr. Vaidya (in his Introduction pp. XVII-XXXI ) brings to gether valuable information about Todarmal and his work 
After a few Introductory verses containing obeisance to Brahman, Kršņa, Ganesa and Manu (in six verses ), a few verses (I. 7-18) deal with the family and ancestors of Todarmal. Todarmal came of a Ksatriya family of Oudh called Țandana. The first ancestor named is Bala (1. 7) who was a devotee of Krsna. His son was Attali – son Dàma ( Damodara ) - Son Assū (a warrior and devotee of Krsna ) - his son Dvārakādasa, patron of learned men-son Dvijamalla - son Bhagavatīdāsa - son Todara malla born at Laharpur in Oudh. The family was in straightened circumstances owing to Bhagavatidāsa's large charities which the Pandit ( who composed the Intro. verses ) says uprooted poverty for a long time ( Intro, v. 13). He had to accept service under Akbar as a clerk. Akbar soon found out Todarmal's great talents and sent him to Gujarat ( wiich had recently been con quered by him) as a gifted revenue settlement officer and also a warrior. Later, Akbar sent him to Bihar and Bengal for the same purpose. Akbar made him a commander, Wuzir and Diwan in 1582 A. D.). Todarmal was not only endowed with high qua lities but was also highly interested in learning and spent much of his wealth in charities, in building or renovating temples, consecrating iniages of Kțsna and constructing large tanks and wells. He is said to have rebuilt the temple of Viśveśvara at the instance of Nārāyapabhatta about 1585 A. D. This temple was later demolished in 1669 A. D. by Aurangzeb, The Todara nanda is divided into 22 sections called Saukhyas and each Saukhya has sub-sections called harsas. 
109. Țodarānanda 
909 
The question is whether Todarral is the author of the work called Todarānanda, that he was the inspirer, there can be no doubt. Verse 19 (of Introduction) states that he called together learned Pandits of pure character, honoured them and instructed them to compile this work which would be the quintessence of the several Purānas and Snistis.1268 Dr. P. L. Vaidya says that the ļodarànananda must have been composed between 1572 A. D. ( which is the year mentioned in Jyotisaukhya p. Xxx of Intro.) and 1589 A. D. (the year in which Todarmal died). We have also to remember that the extent of the Encyclopaedia ( as Dr. Vaidya says on p. 414 ) cannot be fixed with certainty, since the Rājaniti and Karmavipäka sections have not yet been traced and the Śrāddhasaukhya Ms. has no beginning nor end. He further says that we can roughly ascertain the extent of the remaining sections which put together comes to be of 72150 Slokas (each śloka of 32 syllables ). He further conjectures that the extent of the entire Todarānanda may be in the neighbourhood of 80000 
Slokas, 
The several parts of that encyclopædia dealing with ācāra, dāna, vyavahāra, śräddha, viveka, prāyścitta, samaya were called saukhyas. An account of some of the saukhyas that were avail able to me may be concisely given here. The Vyavahārasau khya ( D. C. ms. No. 366 of 1875-76 ) begins with an invocation of Siva, speaks of the pārasika emperor?369 (Akbar) of Hind (India) and then deals with the several topics of judicial pro cedure such as the king's duty to look into disputes, the sabhā, judge, meaning of the word vyavahāra, enumeration of 18 vyarahārapadas, time and place of rjavahara, the plaint, the reply, the agent of the parties (pratinidhi), pratyakalita, the superiority of one mode of proof over another, witnesses, documents, possession, inference, ordeals and oaths, grades of punish

ments and fines. The Vyavahărasaukhya does not dwell on the exposition of the several titles of law. Besides the smsti writers, it principally relies on the Kalpataru, the Parijata, Bhava deva, the Mitaksara, the Ratnakara, Harihara, and Halayudha. The several sections are styled harşas. 
____ The Vivahasaukhya ( D. C. Ms. No. 916 of 1886-92 in folios 54 ) is chiefly concerned with the astrological aspects of marriage viz. the proper year, month, day, zodiacal sign, naksa. tra for marriage, good characteristics of a marriageable girl and bridegroom; proper age for marriage for a girl and a male; many authors and works are quoted (most of which are men tioned below).1370 
The Sraddhasaukhya (D. C. ms. No. 257 of 1884-87) is an extensive work and deals with the usual topics such as the differ ent kinds of sraddhas, the time and place for sraddha, the proper brahmanas, sapindikarana &c. The sections of this work also are divided into harşas. Besides those enumerated above the authors and works mentioned are noted below.1371

such topics as the results of eclipses, the appearance of comets, the rise of Agastya, Ursa major, the signs of the Zodiac &c. It frequently refers to Kāsyapa, Garga (or VỊddhagarga ), Parāsara, Mayūracitra, Varaha. The colophons state that Țodara malla was a scion of the Țandala (or - na) family and that the work was compiled by Nilakantha at the order of Todaramalla.1373 This Nilakantha appears to be the author of the Sanjñātantra on which a commentary was written by his son Govinda in 1622 A. D., in which it is stated that Nilakantha was honoured by Akbar and had composed the Todarānanda.1373 In the Tājika-Nila kanthi of Nilakntha it is stated that the author composed works on the three branches of Jyotisa which gave delight to Țodara. 1374 
The Jyotiḥsaukhya was composed in śake 14941375 ( i. e. 1572 A. D.). The ms. of the Vyavahārasaukhya bears at the end the date saṁvat 1638 ( 1581-821378 A D.) which seems to be the date of its composition. Todaramalla was a man of versatile genius. He distinguished himself as an able commander as well as a great financier and statesman. The Țodarānanda gives some information about the family of Todarmal and his ancestors (as briefly set out above). Besides, Blochman's English translation of the Ain-i-Akbari ( Vol. I. pp. 351–52) gives some informa tion. On p. 352 we are told that his son Dharu i. e. Govar dhanadhari) was a commander of 700 horse and was killed in a campaign in Sindh. Beveridge's Akbarnama (Index Vol. p. 62 ) refers to two sons of Todarmal viz. Dhari (i. e. Govardhana dhāri) and Kalyāņa. Other useful works are; Vincent Smith's biography of Akbar in the series called "Rulers of India"; and Dr. A. S. Altekar's History of Benares (pp. 39-43). Todarmal was born at Laharpur in Oudh and not at Lahore as is often

stated ( vide Blochman's translation p. 620 ) and he died on 10th November 1589 A. D. 
Dr. Vaidya’s edition of the first two parts ( on p. 6 verses 24–27) enumerates the twentytwo parts (called Saukhyas) in which the subjects were distributed ( vide not below).1377 
Several parts of this huge work are described as viracita (composed) by Todarmalla e. g. the printed text of Dr. Vaidya's edition of the first two Saukhyas ( vide note below). Dr. Vaidya (in Intro. P. XXVI ) argues that these words are not to be taken literally, that all that is meant is that Todaramalla conceived the project and provided for all the expenses incurred in engag. ing learned Pandits for collecting the material, for arranging it under proper heads and making copies of the several parts of it. I agree with him in this matter. But Dr. Vaidya goes further and argues ( Introduction pp. XXVII-VIII ) that considering all the facts he would ascribe the authorship of the Todarānanda to Nārāyaṇabhatta chiefly (P. XXVIII of Intro.). I demur to this conclusion. In verse 19 of the Introduction quoted above, it is expressly stated that Todarmal invited learned men of pure character and directed them to compose the work. There was nothing to prevent him from saying that he called 'Bhatta Nārāyaṇa' among the Pandits to preside over the task of pre paring a huge work on Dharmaśāstra. 
Dr. Vaidya agrees (p. xxx of Introduction) that the work was undertaken and finished between 1572 to 1589 A. D., the the year in which Todarmal died. 
To me it appears probable that Nārāyaṇabhatta refused to undertake such a heavy task because he had become old (in

1572 he would have been about 59 years old ). There is ano ther important circumstance indicating that Nårāyaṇabhatta must not have anything to do with this encyclopaedia, since we know for certain that the Jyotiḥsaukhya, (a part of the Todarānanda ) was composed by Nilakantha, son of Ananta (vide p. 398 of Dr. Vaidya's edition ). If the name of one Pandit Nilakantha is expressly mentioned as regards the Samhităsaukhya, no acceptable reason can be advanced as to why Nārāyaṇabhatta's name is not mentioned anywhere, if he had been responsible for the other parts of the encyclopaedia or for the whole work. 
It may be noted that the Todarānanda came to be mentioned as an authoritative work at least from about 1610 A. D. For example, the Nirnayasindhu (of Kamalakarabhatta ) cites it and so does the Vyavahāramayukha of Nilakantha, paternal cousin of Kamalakara ( vide note below). 1978 
The Vivāhasaukhya refers to the Rājanstisaukhya, to the Ganitasaukhya, Samskārasaukhya, Horāsukha (these last three said to be already composed ). 1379

ted that beautiful reservoir in 1646 of the Vikrama era 1380 (i.e. 1589 A. D.). Therefore it follows that literary works were com piled under the patronage of Todarmal between 1570-586 A. D. 
It is not possible for reasons of space to deal with all or most of the Saukhyas of Țodarānanda but it would be inte resting for scholars to know something more of one or more of the other Saukhyas like the Vivāhasaukkya of this large Saukhya called Todarānanda. 
He begins by saying that the person who has completed his studies (snătaka ) and bas returned from the Gurukula is required by the Smstis e. g. Manu III. 2, VI. 34 to become a householder. Therefore our sästras require every young man to be married and in order that he should get married he has to look into the Astrological matters which are omitted here, Manu and others praise Vivaha very much which is unnecessary to set out here. Manu recommends (chap. IX) a girl that has attained puberty to be married by her parents and guardians to a worthy bride-groom and that if such a bride-groom is not secured she might remain unmarried for her life. While arranging for the matter parents or guardians require that an astrologically proper conjunction of heavenly bodies is secured. According to Samskära-saukhya based on Parāśara and other writers the girl should be married between 8 to 10 years. One writer called Sridhara in his work called Vivahapatala quotes that the marriage may be performed at all times. Many authors and works have been quoted in this Vivāhasaukhya No. 916 of 1886 92 at B.O.R.I. Dozens of Smstis and authors are quoted as also astrological and astronomical works. But it is not possible to enter into greater details here for want of space. 
It refers to the Ganitasaukhya on fol. 26 a. He also refers to Horasaukhya on folio 46b, Rājaniti-Saukhya on folio 53 b. 
This ms. is well written and the present author feels that an edition of it can be easily brought out on one ms. alone,

110. Nandapandita 
915 
110. Nandapandita Nandapandita was a voluminous writer on dharmaśāstra. An account of his principal works on dharmaśāstra is given below, particularly because most of them are yet unpublished. He was also called Vināyaka as stated in his commentary ( named Suddhi-candrika) on the Sadasiti (also called Aśaucanirņaya ) of Aditya of the Kausika-gotra. Nandapandita came of the Dharmādhikari family of Benares and is described as the son of Dharmadhikāri Ramapandita. There were several families in Benares famous for their learned works on Dharmaśāstra and other branches such as the Bhātta family (to which belonged Bhattanārāyaṇa, Kamalâkara and Nilakantha ), the Dharmàdhi kāri family and the Sesa family. This last had Sesakssa, his son Viśveśvara, whose three pupils viz. Jagannathapandita, Bhattoji Dikșita and Anņambhatta, author of Tarkasangraha, distinguished themselves as great scholars in their own special studies, 
He composed a commentary called Vidvanmanoharà on the Parāśarasmsti. He expressly mentions therein that he follows the commentary of Madhavācārya.1331 This commentary is referred to in his Vaijayanti. 1382 
He also appears to have written a commentary called Pramitākṣarā or Pratītākṣarā on the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara 1383 This commentary was probably not completed, as only fragments are found with his descendants. 
Nandapandita also composed a work called Sraddhakalpalata, which is referred to in his Suddhicandrika 384 and in the Vaija

yanti. In this work1885 he refers to a city called Sadharana (probably modern Saharanpur ) where the Sahagila family ruled. He speaks of Simhamalla, Vasávana, Rupacandra, Bhūpacandra and Paramànanda as successive members of the dynasty and says that he was urged to write the work by the last of them and that he relies upon the Sraddhadipikă of Govindapandita.1388 At the end of the ms. of the Vaijayanti in the Deccan College Collection it is said that the Vidvanmanoharā, the Smrtisindhu and the Śräddbakalpalatà were the commentaries composed by Nanda pandita.1387 But from the contents given in the India Office Catalogue it does not appear that the work was a commentary. It is divided into five stabakas and deals with the usual topics, viz. what is śråddha, the proper time and place for it, the proper brāhmaṇas, various kinds of sraddhas &c. The principal authors and works named therein are given below.1388 The Śrāddha kalpalată was published in the Chowkhamba S. Series (1935) in 262 pages. In Poona Orientalist (vol. 15 pp. 60-64) Dr. S. L. Katre shows that a ms, of the Sraddhakalpalatā is dated in Samvat 1641 (i. e. 1584-85 A. D.). The same scholar shows (in I. H. Q. vol. 28 for 1952, pp. 91 ff.) that a ms. of Suddhi candrikā (which mentions the Sraddhakalpalatà at least five times ) was copied in Saivat 196), Srāvana-vadi (i. e. in July 1603 A. D.). Therefore Śråddhakalpalatà must have been composed several years earlier than 1603 A. D. 
The Suddhicandrikā of Nandapandita on the Șadasiți of Ad ityācārya has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series of Benares ( 1928 ).1389 The Suddhicandrikā, a commentary on the

Şadasiti or āśaucanirnaya of Kausikāditya, is also one of the works of Nandapandita. It is referred to in his Vaijayanti.1390 The Bhadkamkar collection made by Prof. Velankar contains a ms. of this work and it has recently been published in the Chow khamba Sanskrit Series. The principal authors and works quoted therein are noted below.13 
Another work of Nandapandita is the Smộtisindhu, which seems to have been an extensive digest of smrti material. Portions of it have been recovered. In the Deccan College Colle ction there is a ms. of the Sa.iskāra-nirnayataranga of the Smrtisindhu, which, according to a verse at the end, was composed by Nandapandita at the command of king Harivamsa-varman of the Mahendra family and son of king Maigo.1393 
It appears that he compiled a summary of the doctrines of his work Smrtisindhu. That summary was called Tattvamuktà. vali.1393 It is almost certain that the fragment of the Tattva 
muktavali noticed in the BBRAS Cat. at p. 217 is a part of this work. That fragment contains 8 verses on upakarma and three on holikā with commentary and the verses are numbered from 
(Continued from the previous page) 86 ascribed to कौशिकादित्य and 56 to गोभिल. This Ms. has at end the verse : धर्माधिकारिकुलकैरवकाननेन्दु--श्रीरामपण्डितसुतेन विनायकेन । याकारि शुद्धिपदपूर्वकचन्द्रिका तां विद्वच्चकोरनिवहाः परिशीलयन्तु ॥ The शुद्धि चन्द्रिका mentions, among other work and authors, धर्मप्रदीप, धर्म

557 to 564 and then 607-609. If the above surmise be correct, the work was a large one and contained over 610 verses. Two of the verses name Hemādri and Pārijāta. 1394 
A few words may be said there about the edition of Nanda pandita's commentary Vaijayanti on the Vişnusmộti published (in 1960 ) at Adyar ( in its library series ). It is in two volumes containing 1070 pages in all. The text and com. are printed in beautiful type at the Vasant Press, the Theosophical Society of Adyar. There is a preface ( 4 pages ), Introduction (pp. IX-XXVII) by Pandit V. Krishnamacharya, also a Bibliography, 100 chapters of the Vişnudharmaśāstra, the text of the Smsti in large and beautiful type, the commentary Vaijayanti in a smaller but clear type, several Indexes, viz. alphabetical index of the sūtras of Vişnusmộti, an Index of the words occurring in the sūtras, an Index of the mantras cited in the Vişnusmrti, an Index of the authors and works cited in the commentary; an Index of the texts cited as authorities in the Vaijayanti (pp. 952-1667); Addenda and Corrigenda (two pages ). In this work he refers to a Brāhmaṇa dynasty of the Vasistha gotra at Vijayapura (Vijayanagara ?) in Karpața country, in which was born Konda panāyaka, whose son was Kesavanayaka, whose son was Ananta alias Vāvarasa, whose sons were Kesava and Rudra. Keśava, son of Kondapa, seems to have gone to Benares with his sons and grand sons and made extensive gifts of all kinds.1395 There is a hyper bolical description of his great gifts ( mahādānas including tula, i. e. weighing against gold or silver). In verses 76-77 of the printed edition of Vaijayanti, Keśavanàyaka enjoined upon Nandapandita the task of composing a commentary on the Vişnusmộti. 1396 In the colophons at the end of the chapters of Vişnu, Kondapanāyaka is styled Mahārājādhiraja and it is said that Nandapandita was encouraged in the task by Kesavanayaka alias Tammananayaka.

At the end of chapter 101, we are told that Keśavanāyaka, Nandapandita's patron, secured mokşa by breathing his last on the Manikarnikā in Benares. 1397 There are six verses at the end one of which says that in the Kali age there is no one more liberal than Våvarasa (a son of Kesavanāyaka ) and no one more learned than Nandapandita. 1398 As he wrote on the encouragement of Kesava, the commentary is also styled Keśava Vaijayanti. Among the authors and works mentioned in this commentary are Devasvāmi, Budhasmsti, Bhavadeva, Mädhava carya, Vācaspati, Sarvajña, Subodhini (com. on the Mit. ), Hara datta, Hemădri. In the Vaijayanti he refers to no less than six of his works viz: the Vidvan-manoharā, the Pramitākṣarā, the Śrāddhakalpalată, the Suddhicandrikā, the Dattaka-mimamsă (vide note 1382 above). But in the Dattaka-mimāṁsā itself he refers to his Kesava-Vaijayanti as already composed.1399 There fore it follows that both works were probably being composed at the same time. The Vaijayanti was held by the British Indian Courts as one of the leading authorities of the Benares School of modern Hindu Law.1400 
Nandapandita, though he generally follows the Mităksarà, was not a slavish admirer of Vijñānešvara. He does not accept the explanation the Mitāksarà gives of Yāj. II. 17 (sākṣiṣūbha yataḥ etc. ). Similarly on Vişnu 8. 12, 22. 41, 23. 11, 27. 2 he emphatically says that the Mitākşará is wrong. 1401 He prefers the father to the mother as an heir (on Vişnu 17. 6-7) and seems to have placed the paternal grandmother as an heir after the mother

but before the brother (folio 101 b). He explains sapinda relationship in the same way as the Mit.1402 does. He says that the word 'bhrātaraḥ' in Yaj. should be explained as standing for ' brothers and sisters' and that in the father's line, after the brother and brother's son, the brother's grandson succeeds and, on failure of the brother's grandson, the paternal grandfather, his son and grandson are heirs one after another, i. e. in each line three generations succeed and then there is a devolution in favour of the next higher line. This view is opposed to that of the Subodhinj and the Smsticandrikā, which take only the son and grandson of each paternal ancestor. Vide my notes to the Vyavahāramayukha for fuller details (pp. 253-254). Nanda pandita stands alone among modern nibandhukāras in having recognised a uterine brother1403 (i. e. the son of the same mother but of a different father) as an heir. It is remarkable that Nandapandita preferred a person's predeceased son's widow (i. e. widowed daughter-in-law) as an heir to that man's own daughter.1404 
The Dattaka-mimāṁsā is the most famous work of Nanda pandita. It was translated very early by Sutherland in 1821 A. D. (comprised in Stoke's Hindu Law Books). In the following the edition of Bharatacandra Siromani (published in 1885 with

his own commentary) has been used. In this work he lays down rules as to the person who may adopt, when he may adopt, who can give in adoption, who may be adopted, the motives of adoption, the necessary ceremonies of adoptions, the results of adoption. Among the authors and works qouted or referred to, those mentioned below may be noted. 1405 
The Anandashram Press of Poona brought out (in 1941 A. D.) an edition of the Dattakamīmāṁsā with a modern Sanskrit commentary called Mañjari by Sankara, son of Ranganātha. 
From very early days of the British rule in India the Dattaka mimāṁsā came to be regarded as the standard work on adoption. In Collector of Madura v. Mootoo Ramalinga 408 the Privy Council says “Again of the Dattakamimamsă of Nandapandita and the Dattakacandrikā of Devap abhatta, two treatises on the particular subject of adoption, Sir William Macnaghten says that they are respected all over India; but that, when they differ, the doctrine of the latter is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern jurists, while the former is held to be the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila and Benares." That this estimate is some what too strongly put has been said by the Privy Council itself in Bhagwansingh v. Bhagwansingh1:07 to call it infallible is too strong an expression and the estimates of Sutherland and of West and Bühler seem nearer the true mark; but it is clear that both works must be accepted as bearing high authority for so long a time that they have become embedded in the general law.' The Privy Council furhter lays down 'their Lordships cannot concur with Knox J. in saying that their (of the Dattaka mímāṁsā and Dattaka-candrika ) authority is open to examina tion, explanation, criticism, adoption or rejection like any scientific treatises on European jurisprudence.' 1408 Even in those parts of the Bombay Presidency where the Vyavahāramayükba is a work of paramount authority, the Dattakamimaṁså has on the subject of adoption been preferred in certain matters to the

Vyavahāramayukha. For example, the Bombay High Court, following the Dattakamimamsă, has laid down that among the three higher castes a man cannot adopt his own daughter's, sister's, or mother's sister's son. The view of the Vyavahāra mayūkha, on the contrary, is that he can take these in adop tion. The limits to which Nandapandita will be followed by the courts are laid down in Ramachandra v. Gopal : The authority of Nandapaņdita must be accepted except where it can be shown that he deviates from or adds to the smộtis or where his version of the law is opposed to such established custom as the Courts recognise :.1409 
Several views expressed in the Dattakamimāṁsā have been set at naught in the various provinces by the British Indian Courts. Nandapandita held that a widow could not adopt at all.1410 Except in Mithila this view has nowhere been entertained in India and the Courts have held that the Law of Benares, Bengal, Madras and Bombay is different. Nandapandita put forward the position that the brother's son must be preferred for adoption over any other sagotra or sapinda.1411 This has, however, been treated in all provinces as no more than a mere recommendation and that failure to observe it entails no legal or religious consequences whatever. The expression putra cchāyā' in ' putracchāyāvaham'occurring in the text of Saunaka was explained by Nandapandita to mean “similarity to a son born' and he said that the similarity consisted in the possibility of being begotten by means of niyoga and the like.1412 Suther land wrongly introduced the word 'marriage' after niyoga in his translation and some of the High Courts in India, following this wrong translation, evolved the rule that no one could be adopted whose mother the adopting father could not have legally married in her maiden state,1113 But the Bombay High Court bas laid down that the rule is restricted to the three

specified cases of the daughter's son, the sister's son, and the mother's sister's son.+14 From the text (brāhmaṇāditraye nästi bhāgineyaḥ sutaḥ kvacit), Nandapandita evolved the curious rule that a widow cannot adopt to her deceased husband her own brother's son. But the Privy Council has refused to follow this dictum on the ground that the gloss of Nandapandita is an extension not based on the authority of any smộti and has upheld such an adoption.1418 
It should be noted that the Hindu Adoption and Main tenance Act' (No. 78 of 1956 ) passed by the Indian Parliament has made far-reaching and radical changes in the Law of Hindu Adoption and section 4 of that Act overrules all texts, rules or interpretations of Hindu Law or customs and usages as part of that law, except in so far as they may have been expressly saved by that Act. 
About the personal history of Nandapandita we do not know much. Mandlik in his Hindu Law (LXXII, n. 3) gives what information he could gather from descendants of Nandapandita living in Benares. According to him the founder of the family was Lakşmidhara who was a resident of Bidar (now in the Nizam's dominions ) and who went to Benares. Nandapandita was the sixth in descent from him. Dr. Jolly visited at Benares Pandit Dhundirāja Dharmādhikari who was 9th in descent from Nandapandita (Tagore Law Lectures, p. 15) and Mandlik's information also was gathered from persons who were 9th in descent from Nandapandita. Mandlik also gives a detailed genea logical tree. We learn from several works of Nandapandita and their colophons that he was also nanied Vinayakapandita and was the son of Ramapandita of Benares who is styled Dharma dhikari. Nandapandita also is described as Dharmadhikari in the Saniskāranirnaya-taranga of the Smộtisindhu (vide note 1392 above). It appears that Nandapandıta was at different times patronised by rich patrons from different parts of India. He composed the Sråddhakalpalatà for Paramånanda of the Sahagila

Mandlik notes that Nandapandita is credited with the author ship of 13 works. Eight works of Nandapandita have been named and described above. Mandlik nanes six of these. Besides these he is said to have written Navarātra-pradipa which has been published in the Princess of Wales Sarasvati Bhavana Series, three sections of a work named Harivamśavilasa (viz. dünakautuka, āhnika kautuka and sařskārakautuka ), Balubhusi, Tirthakalpalată, Kalanirnayakautuka, Käsiprakasa, Madhavānanda, But we saw above (note 1393) that the Balabhūși is only a commentary on the Tattvamuktāvali (probably composed by another writer ). The Käsiprakāśa was certainly composed by Nandapandita as he is described in the India Office ms. to have been the son of Rāmapandita.1416 That work was composed at the order of one Sarvabhatta, who was the guru of Krsnanayaka of Madhură. In Mitra's Notices two works, Jyotiḥsastrasamuccaya and Smārta samuccaya, are described as composed by Nandapandita, son of Devašarman and Vịndā.1417 The latter seems to have been an extensive work and dealt with tithinirnaya, intercalary month, marriage, sapinda relationship, the samskāras, daily observances, antyești (funeral rites ), āśauca, sudd'ri, śräddha, prāyaścitta, dayabhāga and vyavahāra. Though the name of the father, Deva šarman, creates suspicion in one's mind, both these works must be regarded as the works of Nandapandita, son of Ramapandita, as in the Smārtasamuccaya the author refers his readers to his Dattaka-mimamsă for the subject of adoption. It is not unlikely that just as Nandapandita had the alias Vinayaka, his father Råmapandita was also called Devašarman. 
Mandlik ( Hindu Law LXXII, n. 3) notes that on a copy of the Madhavananda-kavya composed by Nanda the year samvat 1655 ( 1599 A. D.) is given, probably in Nandapandita's own handwriting. The Vaijayanti was one of Nandapandita's latest works. That work, we are told, was composed at Kāśi in Vikrama samyat 1679 (Nov. 1623 ) on the Full moon of Kartika

when the sun was in Scorpion and the moon in Taurus.1418 There fore the literary activity of Nandapandita must be placed between 1580 and 1630 A. D. Mardilk in his Hindu Law (p. 281) says that the Vaijayanti of Nandapandita is referred to in the Vyavaháramayukha of Nilakantha. I have not been able to find the reference in the latter work, 
111. Kamalākarabhatta 
Kamalākarabhatta was one of the foremost scions of the Bhatta family. He was a grandson of the famous Nārāyaṇa bhatta and a son of Rāmakssṇabhatta. He was one of three brothers, the eldest being Dinakara alias Divakara1439 and the youngest was Laksmanabhatta,1420 who studied under Kamala karabhatta. Kamalākarabhatta's father Ramakršna also was a very421 learned man and a profound mimarnsaka and his mother Umà immolated hereself as a sati. Kamalakara was a man of profound erudition and composed works on almost every śāstra. In some of his own works there are high eulogies of his learn ing and proficiency in Tarka, Nyāya, grammar, mimàmsā (in both the schools of Kumarila and Prabhakara), Vedanta, Poetics, dharnasāstra and Vedic sacrifices,1422 He composed more than twenty-two works. At the end of his Vivādatındava it is

said that he composed the Nirnayasindhu, a commentary on the Vārtika (of Kumarila), a work on the mimamsa (Sastratattva) and a series of 20 other works.1423 At the end of a ms. of the Śàntiratna in the Bhau Daji collection there is a list of 22 works of his out of which the Nirnayasindhu is said to have been the first.1424 More than half of these works are concerned with topics

The verses enumerating the 22 works are found not in all mss. of the Santiratna, but occur in the ms. described in Prof. Velankar's Cat. of Sanskrit and Prakrit Mss. in the Library of the B. B. R. A. S. (p. 234) published in 1925. Though in the Sāntiratna it is stated that the Nirņayasindhu was Kamalākara's first work, yet it appears probable that Kamalakara made additions to that work from time to time e.g. on p. 248 of the Nirnayasindhu he says 'अन्येषु मूलादिऋक्षषु शान्यादि प्रयोगपारिजात मत्कृते शान्तिरत्ने च ज्ञेयम् '; the word ज्ञेयं is rather of doubtful import. It is possible that he had then only planned to write that work. On p. 257 of the same work on ahdapūrti' he refers to his work Śūdrakamalakara “विशेषो मत्कृते शूद्रधर्मे ज्ञेयः" On p. 293 ( of Nirmaya. ) he mentione his Pravaradarpana. The Santiratna is a large work dealing with rites for averting the evil consequences of portentuous phenomena or for birth on certain tithir, nakșatras (like Mula, Jyestha, Aslesa) or evil influences of planets. The śāntiratva is also called Santiratnākara, as in the Ms, in the Bhau Daji Collection of Msg, of the Bombay Asiatic Society ( No. 305 of that collection, the extent being 357 folios); vide Prof. Velankar's Cat. of the Mss. with the B.

of Dharmasastra, viz. the Nirnayasindhu, the Dànakamalākara, Sàntiratna, Pūrtakamalakara, Vratakamalakara, Prāyaścittaratna, Vivadatāndava, Bahvịcàhnika, Gotrapravaradarpana, Karmavi påkaratna, Sūdrakamalakara, Sarvatirthavidhi. The Sūdrakamala kara, the Vivadatāndava and the Nirnayasindhu are the most famous of his works on dharmaśāstra. Brief references may be made here to some of the works of Kamalakarabhatta other than the three mentioned above. It appears from the introductory verses of the Vratakamalakara that Kamalakara intended to compose a digest on dharma called Dharmatattva in ten paric chedas1425 and not only carried it out but added some more works on dharma. It will be noticed that nine out of these 10 sections are enumerated under the same names at the end of the Säntiratna quoted above, the one not named being the section on ācāra. Burnell mentions a work called Acăradipa by Kamalakara on daily duties and on the same page notices another work on àhnika by Kamalakara.1426 It is difficult to say whether both are names of the same work. It is not unlikely that the acāra section of the digest Dharmatattva is the same as the Bahvşcāhnika enu merated at the end of the Santiratna. There is a ms. of the Bahvịcāhnika at Bikaner.1427 It deals with daily duties commenc ing with rising from one's bed at the brahma muhúrta. In this work Kamalakarabhatia refers to his own Prayascittaratna, and

to the Madanapărijāta, Madanaratna, Madhava and Solapāņi. The Púrtakamalakaral428 was an extensive work and dealt with the dedication of tanks, wel's, trees and gardens to the public, the dedication of Ašvartha tree and five sacred trees, dedication and laying the foundation of public buildings, consecration of sacred images, of śālagrāma, of temples and flags, repairing of images, accidental breaking of temples, consecration of Vinayaka, pacification of planets, coronation of kings and emperors. In this work he mentions his own Dánakamalakara. 
The śāntiratna or Säntikamalakara is a huge work.1429 
It deals with various rites for propitiating Vinayaka, the nine planets, and for averting the consequences of portentous occur rences and evil omens, birth on such constellations as müla, the observances known as Ekādasini, Laghurudra, Mahārudra, Sata candi &c. He refers to his own Nirnayasindhu in this work. 
The Nirnayasindhu (on pp. 293, 300-301 ) mentions Pravara darpana as his work on Gotras and Pravaras. 
In the Bombay Asiatic Society's Library there is a ms. of his Saṁskära-prayogakamalakara which appears to be over and above the 22 works enumerated above.130 He starts with an enumera tion of the 48 sariskuras mentioned by Gautama, deals with the several samskåras of puṁsavana, jā takarma, marriage &c., and with utsarjana and upakarma, propitiatory rites on the first appearance of menses, the Astakã sraddha &c. 
His Tattva-kamalakara appears to have been a work of consi derable interest dealing with the bearing of the doctrines and maxims of the Mimaṁsă system on ritual and dharmaśāstra.1431 A ms. of it is dated saivat 1695 Caitra sukla 4 Friday (i. e. 9th March 1638 A.D.), Tattvakamlakara and Mināmsă--kautúhala are two separate works, incomplete mss. of which are in possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

pp. 211-214 ( paper by Prof. Chintaharan Chakravarti). The first is briefly mentioned in Mitra's Notices, vol. III. p. 335 and it is stated in Indian Culture' Vol. V. that it comments on some selected sätras of the Pūrvamiminsă system. The Mimāṁsā-kau tūhala gives a brief outline of the principal doctrines of the Pärvamimāṁsā system. Of the Mantrakamalakara a ms. (complete in 126 leaves) is in the possession of the A.S. of Bengal. The work was composed for the benefit of Ananta, son of Kamalakarabhatta.

I was able to secure a ms. of the Vivadatàndava from the Mandlik collection in the Fergusson College at Poona. That work closely resembles in method and matter the Vyavahăra mayúkha of Kamalākara's cousin Nilakantha, the section on ordeals being almost the same in both. It treats of the follow ing subjects : the sabhä; members of the sabhā; judge, amātya; the scribe and the accountant; conflict of smrtis; the plaint, the reply, the modes of proof, viz. documents, witnesses, possession; modes of punishment; the principal and secondary sons; the enumeration of the eighteen titles of law; partition of heritage and detailed description of the other titles. Like the Vyavaha ramayukha, the Vivadatāņdava quotes the Madanaratna as fre quently as ( or perhaps more frequently than) the Mitāksarā. The other writers and works quoted are noted below.1439 As it mentions several works of his own, viz. Nirnayasindhu, the Dànakamala kara, the Prāyaścittaratna and the Südradharma (i. e. Sūdra kamalakara ), the Vivadatāndava was one of his latest works. On several points he differs from his own cousin Nilakantha. For example, he prefers the mother to the father as an heir and does not give the sister a high place among the gotraja heirs as Nilakantha does. The Vivādatāņdava has been frequently noti ced in judicial decisions.1433 
The Vivadatāndava was published in “ Our Heritage” Vol. VII part 2 pp. 1-23 edited by Dr. Herambanath Chattopadhyaya.

The work is a small one. About half of its 23 pages contain foot notes covering half or more of each page. Pages 2–5 have only 1/3 page for the text. Its first verse is quoted below!434 
The Sūdrakamalakara (also called Sūdra-dharmatattva or Sūdradharmatattvaprakāśa ) has been printed in Bombay several times ( with Marathi translation ). I used the Nirnayasagara edi tion of 1895. In this work he refers to his own Dánakamalakara, Purtakamalakara, Prayaścittaratna and Nirnayasindhu. Out of about two hundred authors and works quoted therein, prominent ones are noted below. 1435 This work is a standard treatise on the duties and religious observances of Sūdras. 
Kamalakarabhatta was at least prepared to say, following his father Rāmakrnsabhatta, that in spite of the statement in some Puranas that in the Kaliyuga only two varnas viz. the first (Brahmanas ) and the last (viz. Sidras ) exist, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas that have given up their proper religious and other activi ties do exist here and there.1436 
He first starts with the discussion that the Sūdra is not authorised to study the Vedas, but that he can listen to the recita tion by Brāhmaṇas of smstis and purānas and religious rites are to be performed for Sūdras with Purāņic mantras. Then the follo wing subjects are dealt with :- worship of Vişnu and other deities by Sūdras and the observances of vratas and fasts by them; Śūdra can make gifts of works of public utility (pārta ); Śūdra can adopt a son; the conflicting views as to the number of saṁskāras for a śdra, most authors holding that he is entitled to ten samskäras (without Vedic mantras ), viz. garbhadhāna, pumsavana, simanta, jätakarma, namakarana, siśuniskramana, annaprašana, cüdākarma, karņavedha, and vivāha; the five great

The Nirņayasindhu or Nirnayakamalākara is the most famous of Kamalakara's works. It is a monument of erudition, industry and lucidity. It has been judicially referred to as a work of authority.f438 I have used the Nirnayasagara edition of 1905 (with Marathi translaticn). In the whole range of nibandhakāras there is hardly any other writer, except perhaps Nilakantha and Mitramiśra, who lays under contribution as many works as Kamalākara does. In the Nirnayasindhu about one hundred smộtis and over three hundred nibandhakäras are mentioned by name. In the introductory verses he expressly says that he pondered over the views of Hemădri, Madhava and other learned writers. The work is divided into three paricchedas. The following is a very concise statement of the contents of this voluminous work. The principal subject is to give decisive opinions as to the proper times for various religious acts; the various views about the year being solar, lunar, sidereal etc., months of four kinds, lunar, solar etc., samkrinti rites and gifts; intercalary month; kşayamasa; about tithis, suddhā and viddhā (combined with another tithi on same day); vratas; the various vratas and festivals during the twelve months of the year; the samskāras from garbhādhana onwards ; sapinda relationship, consecration of images; auspicious times ( muhurtas ) for various actions such as sowing operations, buying horses and cattle &c.; śràddha;

impurities on birth and death; rites after death, rites for sati; samnyāsa. 
The time when Kamalakara flourished can be determined with great accuracy. We saw above that the Nirnayasindliu was one of his earliest works and that it is referred to in several works of his. According to a verse at the end of the Nirnayasindhu the work was composed in 1668 of the Vikrama era on the 14th day of the dark half of the month of Māgha when cyclic year was Raudra (i. e, on the 20th February 1612 A. D.). In a ms. noticed by M. M. Haraprasāda Sastri the same verse is read differently, so as to refer the composition to Vikrama samrat 1678 ; but it is clearly a copyist's error or misreading, since the cyclic year Raudra cannot tally with Vikrama 1678.2469 We saw above that a ms, of the Tattvakamulakara is dated 1038 A. D. Kamalākara was a voluminous writer and therefore we shall be not far wrong if his literary activity be assigned to the period between 1610 A D and 1640 A. D. This date is corroborated in several ways. His grandfather Nārāva a bhatta was born in 1513 A. D. and he quotes in his Nirnayasındhu the Todarānanda compiled in the last quarter of the 16th century. 
The Todarànanda is quoted by the Nirnayasindhu on p. 26, on p. 96 (on Nțsimhajavanti) and on p. 104 (the Tithisaukhya of Todarānanda is quoted in Caturmäsyanirnaya ). 
Though he expressly states in the Introsuctory verse 7 of the Nirnayasindhu that he bestowed proper thought on the views of Hemādri and Madhava and quotes both of them hundreds of times, he differs, in some places, from both of them or one of the two. On the paraņā (breaking the fast) on Sivaratri there are contradictory texts and both Hemādri and Madhava evolve the same order out of contradictions, but Kanalā kara does not accept that i lavastha ( vide pp. 224-25 of the Nirnaya-indhu ). 
Another inter-ting remark of K:malikara hows that he probably introduced changé loigifier the Nirnavasindhu was composed in 1612.İ.D. in re Nirtayasinjhu (ird pari. pūr

vārdha p. 250 on the subject of adoption ) he holds that there is ownership in the father as regards his son and pompously declares that he, who says that there is no ownership in one's son, is a fool.1+46 The Nir: ayasindhu was Kamalakara's first work. The latter was the 2nd son of Rāmakrsna, who was the eldest son of Nārāyaṇabhatta, while Nilakantha was the youngest of four brothers, who were the sons of Sankarabhatta, the 2nd son of Nārāya; abljatta. So though both were first cousins, it is very likely that Nilakartlia, author of the twelve Mayükhas, was junior to Kamalakara by some years at least and could not have been the author of a work before 1612 A. D., the date of the Nirnayasindhu, the first work of Kamalakara. 
Hc desired his work to be encyclopaedic and therefore, he remarks that the rites cailed Satacandi, and Sahasracaņdi are not described in the great works (on Dharmaśāstra ), but as those rites had become popular among people, he describes them in the Nirnayasindhu ( in his section on Navaratra pp. 185-86 ).1441 He quotes the Tristhälisetu of Nårāyaṇabhatta dozens of times (e. g. pp. 16, 89,99,151,208 209, 214, 274 &c.) and also the Prayo garatna of the same, though rot so frequently (as on pp. 53, 259, 266, 267). He quotes Raghunandana's work frequently e. g. Tithitattva (vol. I. pp. 135–36 ) quotes four verses from Linga puràņa ( Asvine paurii. niāsyām tu &.) which are quoted in the Nirnyasindhu (p. 191, 2nd pariccheda ). Similarly, about the amāvāsyā of Ásvina the Nirnayasindiu (p. 200) mentions a passage quoted in Tithitattvali+2 (Jivananda, vol. I p. 185).

On p. 82 he refers to the Konkaņaslt43 that rely on certain passages (about 7 verses) as contained in the Varahapurana about the Jayantis ( tithis) of the ten avataras of Visnu (viz. from Matsya to Kalkin ) and remarks that they are obligatory on the devotees of the respective ten avatāras and optional for others. Here the word Kaunkanas refers probably to learned men from Kopkaņa residing in Benares in Kamalākara's times or to authors from Konkana (probably the latter). 
The Nirnayasindhu frequently mentions an author called Narayana-vrtti krt. (e. g. pp. 37, 55, 58, 116, 153, 191, 291 &c.) on the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gịhya sūtras. He is to be distinguished from Nārāyaṇabhatta (the grandfather of Kamalakara). 
He notes that the works of Gauda authors,144such as the Tithitattva, hold that, after an invitation to officiate at a śraddha is given and accepted, if there is death of a relative of the person inviting a brahmana or a relative of the invitee dies, both are not affected by aśauca, since the Vişnusmrti provides that there is no āśauca for the performer (of sraddba ) nor for the officiating priest after the invitation to officiate is given and accepted. The Nirnayasindhu remarks that the text applies to marriage and not to sraddhas, since the word 'sraddha' does not occur therein.

Kamalakara sometimes differs from his great ancestor Nārāyaṇabhatta. For example, on p. 325 he quotes from the Prayogaratna a verse · If the newly married bride makes her first entrance into her husband's house on the first, third or fifth day or the 2nd or 4th day from the day of her marriage, it is auspici ous, but if she enters on the 6th day after her marriage she would incur sorrow in the form of separation or disease'. The Nirnaya sindhu avers that a passage in support of this has to be found (i. e. the assertoin made is baseless ).1445 On p. 337 (of N. S.) he further points out that in the Tristhalisetu his venerable grandfather stated that sūdras have no right to instal images of deities like Vişnu or Sankara and relied on a passage of the Skandapurāņa quoted in the Brahan-Naradiya but he (Kamalà kara ) says. we hold that, on account of other passages from the Devipuràņa quoted in the Kệtyakalpataru, in the case of sūdras there is an option as to establishing images of Vişņu or Sankara.1446 Vide p. 553, where he differs from Nārāyaṇabhatta about suicide by a brābmana in certain circumustances and p. 554 where Madhava, Aparátka and Hemādri approve of it for certain persons suffering from incurable diseases. 
In some matters the N. S. takes a position far in advance of what some orthodox brábmaņas in modern times would like to recommend or follow; e. g. on p. 304 he provides that when a girl reaches the age of puberty, one should not wait to consider whether Jupiter's position is favourable but she should be got married even when Jupiter is in the 8th place from the rasi at her birth ( after performing Bịhaspati-šānti thrice ). 
There are some interesting observations he makes. For example, if a man does not know his gotra and prarara he

quotes Satyāsādha to the effect that he should take the gotra and pravara of his purohita or ācārya; if he does not know them be should adopt the gotra and pravara of some one else or he should adopt Jamadagni as his gotra.1447 
People in the medieval times seem to have been frightened by the very names of some of the naksatras on which children were born. It is stated in the Brahmayamala quoted in the Nirnayasindhu that the effects of the birth of a child on one of the ten parts of the Jyesthā-nak satra are respectively as follows: (1) death of the child's mother's mother, (2) death of the child's mother's father, (3) death of the mother's brother, (4) death of the child's mother, (5) death of the child itself, (6) destruction of the gotra ( of the child ), (7) destruction of the families of the child's mother and father, (8) death of the elder brother (of the child ), (9) death of the father-in-law of the child, (10) death of relations. Similarly, very dire results of the birth of a child on Müla naksatra are stated; viz. a child born in the first two ghatikās of Mūla should be abandoned or the father of the child should not see its face for eight years; birth of a child born on the four quarters of the Māla naksatra portends respectively death of the father, death of the mother, loss of father's wealth and the 4th quarter is auspicious. 
The Nirnayasindhu is a very large work and is divided into three Paricchedas ( sections ). The firsr section (pp. 1-77) deals with Kāla divisions viz. Abda (year ), ayana (half year ), itu (seasons ), māsa ( months ), divasa ( days); the year is of five sorts acc. to Madhava viz. Sāvana, Saura, Candra, Nākṣatra and Bārhaspatya; the year for Dharmaśāstra purposes, acc. to Hemadri, is only of three kinds (the last two not being required in Dharmaśāstra); months are twelve; the candra years have respectively sixty names Prabhava, Vibhava &c.; Malamasa, Ksayamāsa; tithis are either suddha ( that is not mixed with or joined to another tithi on the same day) or viddhā (joined to another tithi on the same day); vratas; installations of images;

matters to be avoided on the tithis (from 1st to 15th ); eclipses and rites on them; bath in the sea. The 2nd pariccheda (pp. 79 230 ) deals with the first tithi of the year and nirnayas ( decisions about it ) throughout the twelve months of the year from Caitra onwards and discusses the religious acts (krtya) to be performed on the tithis of the months from Caitra onwards; the third pariccheda is called prakirnaka (miscellaneous) and is divided into two parts; The first (pūrvardba on pp. 231-371 ) deals with the Saṁskāras from Garbhādhāna to Vivāha (marriage ), with Vedic mantras for three varņas and without Vedic mantras for śūdras ; time for Agnihotra; proper times for performing certain religious acts such as dedication of tanks and wells to the public, planting groves, installing images of gods for worship, and their worship; muhurtas (proper or auspicious times) for certain acts such as agricultural operations, shaving the head, for beginning to take madjcines, for oil bath, for beginning to build a house, or for occupying it for the first time Kalivarjya ( actions forbidden in the Kaliyuga ); the latter part of the third section (Uttaràrdha) occupies pp. 372-636 and deals with the following: 
Sraddhas (pp. 372–510 ) in all twelve varieties of śrāddhas, of which Parvana, ekoddista, Vļddhistāddha and Sapiņdana are the principal ones; āśauca (impurity on birth and death) pp. 510-622, Sabagamana (pp. 623–626); Vidhavādharmas ( duties of widows) and Sannyasa ( pp. 627-635 ). 
On several topics in the Nirpayasindhu, Kamalakarabhatta, quotes verses composed by himself, such as on the best or middling brāhmaṇas to be invited in sråddhas and those that should not be invited at Sraddhas (on pp. 396, 399 ) and remarks the basis for such selection may be under stood from Hemādri (pages 396-97 of Nirnayasindhu) and for those to be avoided from Hemādri and Pșthvicandrodaya (p. 399 )'. On p. 459 he cites a verse composed by himself about the Vaišvadeva homa on the day of Śråddha. Gāgābhatta alias Viśveśvarabhatta, who officiated at the coronation of the great Shivaji in 1674 A. D., was Kamalakarabhatta's nephew.

history of Nilakantha, his works, their contents, their position in dharmaśāstra literature, the period of Nilakantha's literary activity and his position in modern Hindu Law. In the following a brief résumé of the conclusions there arrived at is given. 
Nilakantha was a grandson of Nārāyanabhatta and a son of Sankarabhatta. Sankarabhatta was a profound mimāṁsaka and composed several works on mimāṁsā, viz. a com. on the Šāstradipikā, the Vidhirasāyaṇadusana, the Mimamsábalaprakasa. He also wrote Dvaitanirnaya (vide Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute, vol. III part 2. pp. 67-72 for an account of it) and the Dharmaprakāśa or Sarvadharmaprakāśa. Nilakantha composed an encyclopaedia of religious and civil law, styled Bhagavanta bhaskara, in honour of his patron Bhagavantadeva, a Bundella chieftain of the Sengara clan, that ruled at Bhareha near the confluence of the Jumna and the Chambal. This work is divided into 12 sections ( called mayukhas 'rays ') on samskāra, ācāra, kāla (or samaya ), sråddha, niti, vyavahāra, dāna, utsarga, pratișthà, prāyaścitta, suddhi, śānti. These have been printed at Benares and some of them have been printed in Bombay at the Gujarati Press and all twelve between 1921–28 A. D. by Mr. Ghar pure. Besides this encyclopaedia he composed also a work called 
Vyavahāratattva, which is a summary of the Vyavahäramayukha, and probably a work styled Dattakanirnaya. The Vyavahāra tattva has been for the first time published by me as appendix I to my edition of the Vyavahāramayukha. 
In Mss. of the several Mayūkhas there are introductory verses which set out a royal family called Sengara, the first named king being Karna, followed by more than a dozen kings, King Bhagavantadeva of that family directed Bhatta Nilakantha to write a work (nibandha). The work was called Bhagavanta bhāskara and as the sun (Bhāskara ) is also called 'Dvadasātma' (as in Amarakośa ) the work is divided into twelve parts (called Mayûkhas ). It appears from some Mss. that Sarkara, son of Nilakaptha, had something to do with the Saṁskāramayükba (vide footnote ).1448

Nilakantha is one of the foremost nibandhakaras. Being brought up in a family that had made the study of mimāṁsā its own for several generations, he is very acute in applying the maxims and rules of mimamsā to dharmaśāstra. He stands unsurpassed by any mediaeval Sanskrit writer on dharmaśāstra in mastery over the vast smsti lore, in lucidity of exposition, in conciseness and ease of style, in clarity of vision and sobriety of judgement. Though he admired the learning and labours of such predecessors as Vijñānesvara, Hemadri and others, he does not slavishly follow their dicta and expresses his dissent from them most frankly. 
His Vyavahāramayukha was held to be a work of paramount authority by the Bombay High Court before 1956 ( when Hindu law was codified) in certain parts of India–Gujerat, the island of Bombay and northern Konkan.1449 Even in the other parts of the Bombay Presidency such as the Maratha country and the Ratnagiri District the Vyavahāramayukha occupies a very

important place though it was subordinate to the Mitāksarā2450 The general principle, on which the Bombay High Court acted in construing the rules laid down in the Mitáksarā and the Vyava häramayukha, is that the two works are to be harmonized with one another wherever and so far as that is reasonably possible.1451 Though the Mitakşarà is a paramount authority in the Maratha country and the Ratnagiri District and though it is silent about the sister's right as a gotraja heir, the courts, in deference to the authority of the Vyavaharamayukha, have assigned to the sister a high place as an heir even in the Maratha country and in Ratnagiri. Among the other Mayūkhas, the Samskāramayukha has been frequently relied upon by the courts,1452 The Praya Ścittamayukha and the Pratişthàmayūkha 1453 have also been relied upon in the High Court. 
The period of Nilakantha's literary activity can be settled within very narrow limits. He was the youngest son of Sankara bhatta. In the Dvaitanirnaya, Sankarabhatta quotes the views of the Todaränanda which, as we saw above, must have been composed between 1570 and 1589 A. D. So the Dvaitanirnaya could not have been composed before i590 A. D. Nilakantha, the youngest son of Sankarabhatta, could hardly have commenced his literary career earlier than Kamalakarabhatta who was the second son of Sankarabhasta's elder brother. Kamalākara com posed his Nirņayasindbu in 1612 A. D. The Nirnayasindhu is mentioned in the Samayamayakha (p. 67) and in Suddhimayu kha p. 23 (both in Gharpure's ed.) and Bhattoji-Dikṣita is mentioned in Acāramayukha (p. 54). Nilakantha refers to his father's Dvaitanirnaya in Sraddhamay kha p. 59. 
It may be noted that a work called Sāntikaustubha by Nilakantha is described in Prof. Devasthali's Cat. of the Sanskrit

mss. in the Bombay University Library (No. 1162 on p. 415 ). It seems to be different from the Säntimayukha of Nilakantha, The ms. is dated sake 1698 ( 1776 A. D.) So Nilakantha's literary activity must have commenced a good deal after 1610. One ms. of the Vyavahāratattva bears the date sarnyat 1700 (1644 A. D.) This shows that the Vyavahāratativa was composed not later than 1644 A. D. The Vyavahăratattva refers to the Vyavahārama yükha as already composed. Hence we may say, without being far from the truth, that Nilakantha's literary career falls between 1610 and 1645 A. D. This date is confirmed by the fact that Nilakantha's son Sankara wrote the Kundabhāskara in 1671 A. D. and Divákarabhatta, the son of Nilakantha's daughter, composed his Ācārārka in 1686 A. D. It appears that there was probably a rivalry between the two great cousins Kamalākarabhatta and Nilakantha. On many matters their views diverged. Though the Nirnayasindhu is said to have been composed in 1668 of the Vikrama era, yet from the references to several works of his own in the Nirnayasindhu it looks as if Kamalakara revised it from time to time by adding on references to his own other works and to those of others. The Nirnayasindhu (III pariccheda, section on Dattakagrahana ) emphatically says that he who asserts the absence of ownership in one's son in spite of Vedic indica tions is a fool.145+ la is not unreasonable to suppose that this is a hit at Nilakantha who must have been younger than Kamalà kara and who tries hard in his Vyavahāramayūkha to establish that there is no ownership in one's wife and children. 
113. The Vīramitrodaya of Mitramiśra 
The Viramitrodaya is a vast digest composed by Mitramisra embracing almost all branches of Dharmasastra. Excepting the Caturvarga-cintamani of Hemādri, this work is probably the largest known on dharmaśāstra. But it surpasses in interest and usefulness even Hemādri's work since it deals with vyavahāra also. It was divided into sections called prakāśus. When the first edition of the His. of Dh. was published in 1930, the prakāśas on vyavahära, Paribhāşı, samskåra, rājaniti, ähnika. pojă, tirtha

and laksana had been published, the first by Jivananda (Cal cutta 1875) and the rest in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The text of the dayabhāga portion of the Vyavahāraprakāśa was also published by Golapchandra Sarkar Sastri with an English translation ( Calcutta 1879). It appears that Mitramiśra wrote on prāyaścitta also.1455 of the Prayaścittaprakasa there is a complete and well written ms. (No. 2610) in the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner and there is also another ms. of Laksaņaprakāśa ( No. 239 p. 49 of Val. Cat. of. mss. in l. C. Desai collection). The very names of the sections of the Viramitrodaya convey an idea of the subjects dealt with in them. The Lakşaņa prakása deals with the auspicious signs of men, women, the several Parts of human body, elephants, horses, thrones, swords, bows and with the characteristics and qualities of the queen, the ministers, the astrologer, physician, door-keeper, description of śàlagrăma, śivalinga, rudraksa beads etc. In the Ālinikaprakāśa he dilatcs upon the daily duties beginning with one's rising from bed on brāhmamuhurta, sauca, ácamana and ending with going to bed. The Vyavahàraprakasa is probably the leargest nibandha on vyzvahāra. This is divided into four parts The first part deals with the meaning of vyavahāra, the constitution of the sabha (court of justice ), the appointment of judges, conflict of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra, assessors, the various grades of courts, the procedure about plaints and defendant's replies and their faults; the burden of proof and and the means of proof. The second gives a detailed exposition of the means of proof, viz. witnesses, documents, possession and ordeals. The third treats of the eighteen titles of law including dāyavibhāga and the fourth very briefly speaks of those matters which were to be started suo motu by the king and not by a private individual. The dāyavibhāga portion of the Vyavahäraprakāśa occupies a little more than-one-fourth of the whole of the work. 
In the Tirthaprakāśa he deals with the naiure of tirthus, the utility thereof for men, the persons entitled to undertake pilgrim age, the proper times for pilgrimage, the ceremonial acts to be performed at tirthas such as shaving, fasts, bathing, gifts, the

description of the several varşas and dvipas and of sacred rivers like the Ganges, Narmadā, sacred places like Gayā, Prabbāsa, Badri, Puskara and Puri. 
In the Pūjāprakāśa he speaks of the definition of pujà, persons entitled to perform pūjā ( worship of gods ), the rewards of pijā, proper times and places for pūjā, sālagrāma, the proper articles and clothes for the worship of idols, proper flowers, fragrant substances, naivedya, the detailed method of worshiping Vişnu, Siva, the Sun, Durgā, Brahmă etc. In the printed edition there are no introductory verses here. 
In the Samskara-prakāśa the author enumerates the samskåras and describes in detail garbhādhāna, pumsavana, anavalobhana, simantonnayana, jātakarma, nåmakarana, śiśuniskramana, anna prāśana, cudà, upanayana, vivāha etc., the duties of brahmacàrins, gotras, pravaras and sapind ya, all astrological matters in connec tion with marriage, pindapitryajña, sarpabali, aștakāśråddha, 
śūlagava. 
The Rājanitiprakāśa treats of the definition of răjan, the proper time and procedure of coronation, the daily routine for kings, the qualifications of ministers, commander-in-chief and the dependents of king, forts, capital, places, the four expedients of sāma etc. the six gunas, auspicious and evil signs, marching for battle, Kaumudi and Indradhvaja festivals etc. 
In all his works Mitramiśra mentions hundreds of authors and works. The portion on vyavahāra is full of long-drawn controversies in which he refutes the views of numerous prede cessors. The Viramitrodaya enters into polemics far more fre quently than Nilakantha. He generally upholds the Mitakşarà of Vijñāneśvara againts all its critics, particularly the writers of the Bengal school. But he does not slavishly admire the Mitākşarà in every thing. Now and then he rebukes even Vijñānesvara. For example, he does not approve of what the Mitākṣarā says about the son called Kanina. 436 He finds fault with Vijñāneśvara's explanation of the verse anyodaryastu' as extremely forced and

The Viramitrodaya was held to be a work of high authority by the Privy Council in the Benares School of Hindu Law. The Vyavaharaprakasa was published in the Chowkhamba Series in 1932. The Privy Council has laid down that the Viramitro daya is properly receivable as an exposition of what may have been left doubtful by the Mitāksarā and declaratory of the law of the Benares school. ' 1459 Similarly it has been said by the same high tribunal that the Viramitrodaya may be referred to even in Bengal where the Dāyabhaga is silent.1460 But where the text of the Mitāksarà on any point is quite clear, the gloss of the Viramitrodaya on the text of any sage, which is in conflict with the rule laid down in the former, cannot be referred to for the purpose of casting a doubt on the clear rule of the Mitaksarā.1481 The Viramitrodaya is inferior to the Vyavahāramayukha in Western India 482 and its doctrines are not followed in those provinces when in conflict with those of the other two works. Their Lordships of the Privy Council say in Vedachala v. Subra

In the introductions to the several sections of his digest and also in the colophons therein Mitramiśra furnishes consider able information about himself, his family and the family of his patron. Mitramiśra was the son of Paraśurāma pandita and grandson of Hamsapandita. Hamsapandita seems to have been a native of Gopācala ( Gwalior) and was endowed with the rare combination of wealth and learning. One Candeśvara of Kasi was the guru of Parasu rămapandita. Mitramisra indulges in hyperbolic1496 descrip tions of his own learning and naively tells his readers that they need study only his work and nay neglect all other nibandhas. Mitramiśra was commanded by Virasimha to compose his great digest.1467 The introduction to the Ahnika prakāśa starts with king Medinimalla who was a scion of the Kasirāja family. His son was Arjunadeva who became ruler of Bundelkhand. His son was Malakhāna, whose son was Pratăparudra (founder of the capital Orccha). In the commentary of Mitramisra on the Vyava hāra section of Yaj. Snnrti the serond verse begins 'आस्ते क्षोणि प्रशस्तिस्तनुरिव गिरिशम्बोंडछापूरपूर्वा' i. e. the capital is called ऑडछापूर (or 'पुर). His son was Madhukarasaha, whose son was Virasimha. Vide Dept. of Letters, Calcutta University, vol.

Jujbāra who is described as “young' (yuvă in verse 23). His son was Vikramārka whose son was Narasimhadeva. There is no such introduction to the printed Pajāprakāśa and Narasimhadeva is not mentioned in the intrcductions to the other prakāśas. From the article of Mr. Lala Sitaram in the Calcutta Review ( May and July 1924) further information can be gathered about Birsinghdeo (i. e. Virasimhadeva). In the article it is shown how and under what circumstances Virasini ia killed Abul Fazal, the friend of Emperor Akbar and a great literary genius. We are told there that there is a work called Virasimhadeva-carita composed in Vikrama year 1664 (1607-8 A. D.) by Kesavadasa, author of Kavipriya and Rasikapriyā. Virasi'ńha was 7th out of the eight sons of Madhukarasāha. Not only was he a soldier, but he was a great builder. He built the palace forts of Orcchha and Datia, the temple of Keśavadeva at Mathurā, several lakes called Birasågara, Simhasāgara and Deosågara (after the three parts of his own name). He is said to have ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627 A. D. From the introduction to the commentary1469 on Yajna valkya it appears that Virasiniha commanded Mitramióra to write it and that a learned man Sadananda, the ornament to Tirabhukti (Tirhoot) received directions to collect materials from Mitramiśra who was a wealthy person. It will be seen that the title Virami trodaya very cleverly suggests that Mitramiśra wrote it under the patronage of Virasimhadeva. The title may mean 'the rise of Vira

The time when Mitramisra ficurished can be easily settled on account of his relations with Virusi ihadeva. In his Áhnika prakasa (vide footnote 1468 aboie ) he mentions the great-grand son of Virasiirha. Therefore ihal section must have been written when Virasiriha was advanced in age. Virasimha ruled at Orchha from 1605 to 1627. lunce ihe literary activity of Mitramiśra musi be placed in the first two quarters of the 17th century. This date agrees with the fact that he names Vācaspati and Raghunandan?. Ve thus see tai Miiramisra was almost a contemporary of Kamulakaribiatta and Nilai.antha. The two latter do not refer to him por does Mitranišra name them.

It is not possible for reasons of space to give even briefly the contents of all the twenty-two parts of Viramitrodaya. 
An attempt has to be made to convey the matters dealt with in a few of the 22 parts. The Rájanitiprakāśa covers 493 printed pages. A very brief summary of it would be interesting. The meaning of the word 'rājan'; praise of king's office; coro nation of a king and the proper times for the coronation and those that are prohibited for it. Description of the ceremony of coronation; the good qualities required in a king and actions prescribed for kings and those forbidden; his daily duties; per sons who are helpers of the king viz. the Chief Minister the Commander-in-chief, the beads of departments, envoy, chamber lain, guard, servants; forts and capital; treasury, army, friends; the Upāyas Såma, Dāna, Darda, Bheda; taking counsel with ministers; guarding the heir to the throne; the aspects of policy; the circle of kings; the six gunas laid down by Manu VII, 160 and Yāj. I. 347; marching on an invasion; king's dreams and their meaning; the good or evil oriens; preparing the king for actual fight; public festivals like Kaumudi; raising Indra's banner; worship of Bhadrakāli; Lohābhisărika; Vasor-dhārā; homa causing destruction of enemies; the rite called Ghịtaka mbala described in Vişnudharmottara; prakirnaka (miscellaneous matters ); sights and dreams that are auspicious and those that are inauspicious; nimittas (i. e. throbbing of certain parts of the body such as eyes); Jarābhişeka according to the Linga

The Tirthaprakāra of the Viramitrodaya occupies 610 printed pages. After mentioning the several members of the family of his patron Virasimha, he praises himself to the skies in verses 32–33, ( vide note 1471 above). In 18 verses he gives a summary of its contents, viz. the large provinces and mountains of Jambu dvipa (India), description of Kasi, Prayaga, Gayāvidhi, of rivers like Sarasvati, Gangi, Yamunā, Narmadā, holy places like Kuruksetra, Kokümukha, Pộthidaka, Prabhāsa, Puşkara, Badari, Lohärgala, Kedāra, Naimiņa.

He proposes to restrict the word Tirtha only to such places or rivers as are enumerated as tirthas by the learned or by great sages, 
He profusely quotes the Mahabharata in the Tirthaprakāśa. Tirthas are either Daiva (such as Vārāṇasi, Prabhasa, Puskara ), or asura (such as Gayà ); or ārsini (those that are established by sșis ) and mānusa are those establisbed by rulers of Surya vamsa or Somavamsa. Men of all varnas and asramas are entitled to perform tirthayātră (p. 19). The Mahābhārata and the Puranas are full of descriptions of tirthas and pilgrimages. Kuruksetra!474 as a tirtha is described in Vanaparva 83. 1-8. Vanaparva chapters 87-90 speak of the tirthas in the east, south, west and north respectively. Salyaparva (chapters 35-39) describes the tirthas which were visited by Balarama in

On p. 315 of the Rājanitiprakasa'176 he quotes a verse of Vyāsa in which different words are given to indicate what Daiva is and which distinguishes Purisakāra ( human effort ) from Daiva; vide also Manu VIl. 205, Yaj. 1. 349 and 351. Vanaparva (82.9-12) deals with this topic of Daiva and Purusakāra.1477 
___ In the Indian Historical Quarterly ( Vol. 24 for 1948 pp. 336-7) Pandit K. Madhav Krishna Sarma informs scholars that the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner has a ms, of the Mokşa prakāsa. The first folio is missing. There are in all 342 paper folios, 8 lines on each page and 40 syllables in each line. The 
main topics dealt with are stated in the mote belkw.1578 
His Bhaktiprakása is a substantial work of 175 printed pages. In bis Introductory verses he states the philosophical doctrine that God is one, but he further states that Aukti is difficult; the mind does not give up all the worldly by matters. Therefore devotion to Hari is the only way. He mentions the nine aspects

of 'bhakti' (the verse is quoted below )1479 and dilates on them in pp. 31-128. He points out each of the nine aspects may be Sattviki, Rājasi or Tầmasi and expounds these. He mentions the Bhagavatapurāna and the commentator Sridharasvāmin fre quently. He frequently quotes the Puraras and the Bhagavad gità. At the end (on pp. 134-175) he deals with 'bliajaniya nirnaya' (exposition on the object of worship ). 
In the Vyangyārtha-kaumudi of Anantàsrana 180 of Punya stambha (Puņtāmibe ) on the Godavari, a commentary on the Rasamañjari of Bhanudatta, the author gives a pedigree of his patron. He describes the Käsirāja family at Benares, in which was born Prataparudra whose son was Madhukarasāha, whose son was Virasimhadeva. Ananta wrote the commentary for Candrabhānu, a son of Virasi hadeva, in 1635 A. D. This corroborates the dates above given by Mr. Lala Sitaram. There fore it is almost beyond doubt that the literary activity of Mitra misra lies between 1610 and 16-40 A. D.

Anantadeva compiled a vast digest called Smrtikaustubha divided into several sections on suriskiras, ācāra, riadharma, dāna, utsarga, pratisthà, tithi and samvatsara. The section on sans kāras and that on rajadharma are also called Saniskåra-kaustu bha and Rajadharma-kaustele. Euch Kaustubha is subdivided into parts called didhiti. The Savskūra-haustubha is the most popular and most well-kaowo of his. It has been printed several times, the best editions being that of the Nirnayasagara Press (1913) and that issued at Baroda ( 1914) under the patron age of H.

lation by Sastri Venkatacarya Upadhyaya). The Saṁskāra-kau stubha was recognised as an authoritative work for India by the Privy Council and the Bombay High Court1481. It is a large work dealing with the samskäras from Garbhādhana to vivāha (marriage ) and is full of quotations and discussions. The following is a very brief summary of the contents : 
The sixteen saṁskāras, the first being garbhādhāna, the astrological aspects of the first appearance of menses and the various propitiatory rites therefor; the proper times for garbhă dhāpa and the several rites connected therewith; punyāhavācana, nändišrāddha, mātskāpūjana; pārāyanabali and nāgabali; pañca gavya, kṛcchra and other prāyāscittas; cảndrayanavrata; adop tion, who is entitled to adopt, who can be adopted, rites of adoption, gotra and sāpind ya of the adopted son, mourning to be observed by the adopted, succession of the adopted; putra kāmesti; puisavana; anavalobhana; simantonnayana; rites on the birth of a child or son; impurity on birth; propitiatory rites for evil aspects at birth; nămakarana; nișkramana; anna prāśana; piercing the ear; celebration of birth day; caula; upanayana, proper times for it, the necessary materials for it, the gāyatri, the vows of a brahmacārin; samăvartana; marriage, sāpiņdya for it, gotras and prararas, proper times for marriage, forms of marriage, vāg-niscaya, simāntapujana, madhuparka, kanyādāna, vivāhahoma, saptapadi, homa on the entrance of the married couple etc. 
The portion of the Samskara-kaustubha on the subject of adoption is frequently cited separately as Dattakadidhiti and is so entered in the catalogues of mss. It is a treatise of great import ance and deserves to be studied along with the Dattaka mimāmsă, the Vyavahāramayükha and other similar works. The more important of his views are set out below. Like the Dattaka mimāṁsā he recommends that the nephew is the most suitable for adoption, then one may select any sagotra sapinda, then an asagotra sapinda, then a sagotra but asapinda, then any one of the same caste though not sagotra, but a daughter's or sister's son

cannot be adopted nor can a brother, a paternal or maternal uncele be adopted. A Sudra may adopt a daughter's or sister's son. The person to be adopted must not be an only son or the eldest. A wife can adopt with the consent of her husband and a widow does not require the express perniission of her husband. The boy to be adopted may be below five or above five and may be taken before or after the cūdā ceremony is performed in the natural family. Anantadeva refers to the 452 view of some that the verses of the Kàlikāpurāņa on this subject are not found in several mss, and so are unauthoritative and tells us that others hold that the whole passage refers to the adoption of an asagotra boy. Anantadeva himself holds, like the Vyavahāramayukha, that even an asagotra boy may be adopted after his upanayana is performed in the natural family. When the ceremony of caula and the rest are performed in the family of the adopter, the adopted boy belongs to the gotrı of the adopter, but where

the upanayana alone is performed in the adoptive family or the adoption is made after upgnayana the boy belongs to both gotras. But this holds good only as regards obeisance, sraddha etc, while for marriage every adopted boy has to avoid the gotra and prarara of both families. If a natural son be born to the adopter after he takes a boy in adoption, the adopted boy becomes an equal sharer with the aurasa, if all the sani: kāras up to ypanayana are performed by the adoptive father for the adopted boy, or he takes only a fuurth share if only some of the sanskaras ending with upanayana are performed by the adopter and he gets no inheritance but only provision for marriage if he was adopted after upanayana is performed in the natural family. Anantaceva, disagreeing with Nilakantha, holds that a girl may be adopted.1483

Like the Nimayasindhu and the mayüluas of Nilakantha, Anantadeva in the Sanskarakaustubha and elsewhere names several hundred authors and works. It is not necessary to set out the whole lot. His authorities are practically the same as those of the former. He principaily relies among nihandas uron the Mitūksarā, Aparāska, Hemădri, Madlara, Macanaratna, Madanapārijāta.

striking in it and often it is very meagre as compared with even Yaj. smsti e g. on Sambhūyasanutthana' it quotes only four verses (without a word of comment ) that are Yāj. II. 259-60, 263–265, while Yâj. devotes seven verses to the same topic viz. II. 259–2651186 
The Rajadharmakaustubha quotes profusely from the Matsyapurāna, the Visnudharmottara-purana and the Bșhatsa mhità ( whole chapters being quoted semetimes from these ). Dr. Miss. Priyabala Shah published Khanda III of the Vişnudharmo ttara (chapters 1-118 ) in two parts in the Gaekwad Oriental Series. Vide also Studies in Dharmaśāstra' by Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya (1964), pp. 22–23 for Anantadeva. 
The name Smộtikaustubha (cf. the Nir. ed. of 1908) is misleading. It does not deal with all or many topics treated of in Smstis. It deals only with the religious rites to be performed in tbe Candra year in its several months and on several uthis and the religious rites to be performed in the other four kinds of years and their months. The Smộtıkaustubha is really · Abdadidhiti'

I would like to devote here a few lipes to the memory of the learned editor of the Rājadharmakaustubha, Mabāmaho padhyapa Kamalakrsna Smộtitirthy. He was born in 1870 in a Pandit family at Bhatpara (well-krown as Bhattapalli) in West Bengal about 22 inįles north of Clacutta ) and was 11th in descent from Nārāyana, the original settler in the town. He accrmpanied M. JI, Haraprasad Shastri in his tour for search of Sanskrit Miss, in Nepal in 1897. He worked as Prof. of Sinrti in the Sankrit College at Bhatpara till his last day (1. e, 25th January 1931). He edited many works víz, the Hiralalā noflairuditha, three Ratnākaras of Canile svari, in lintya, Grastha and Vivāda), the Tirthacintā mani of Vācaspati, four Kaumudīs of Govindānanda (on Varsakriyā, Dāna, Srāddhi and Suddhi); all the nine published in the B. I. Series Rājadharinakaustubha of Anantadeva, Danila viveka of Vardhamana , both published in the Gaekawad's Oriental Series ). The Gurt. of India conferred on him the title of Mahāpahopadhyāya in 1926. He also edited some works in Bengali, e. v. he translated the Agastyasambitā in Bengali and publishad it in Bengali script; he translated into Bengali the latter half of Souadeva's Katbásarita sāgara (and it was published after his death ).

L 
or 'Saṁ atsaradidhiti' 1487 as Anantadeva expressly says in Introductory verse 20 of the Smộtikaustubha that he is going to expatiate on 'Abdadidhiti'. 
In this work, while describing the religious rites to be per formed on certain tithis he frequently cites at some length the kathas ( stories ) connected with those tithis; vide, for examples, the Vata-$āvitrivratakathā on Jyestha Paurņamási pp. 44-50, Mahå laksniikathā on pp. 148-150, Anantacaturdašivratakatha (pp. 170-175), Sivaratrivratakathā (pp. 398-410 ). 
Hemādri1488 deals only with three kinds of abdas or samvatsa ras viz. Lunar (cândra), Saura ( solar) and Savana, while Madhava added two more viz. Bárhaspatya and Nåksatra. The Smộtikaustubha ( pp. 462-63) quotes Yājñavalkya (1. 265–268) which set out the results of performing Sraddhas on the naksatras from Kșttikā to Bharani. The Manusmști III. 277 provides what one secures by perforniing sraddhas on the even tithis (2nd, 4th &c. ) and even Naksatras ( Bharani, Rohiri &c.) and on 1st, 3rd and other uneven t:this and naksutras ( Aśvini, Krttikās etc.). 
It is unnecessary to go into details about the other treatises on prayascitta, &c. It is said by Eggeling (1.0 Cat. No. 1475) that Anantadeva's Smrtikaustubha comprised twelve parts. For Bhagavadbhaktinirraya vide Velankar's Cat. of Iccharam Desai collection p. 49. Anantadeva also wrote several prayogas such as the Agnihotraprayoga, Căturmāsyaprayoga. In the Bhadkamkar collection there is a ms. of a drama called Krsna

In the Smartikaustubha (Nirnayasagara edition of 1909) Anantadeva gives a pedigreel458 of his patron's family. The family claimed descent from the moon. Whether the first three kings, mentioned in the Smrtikaustubha, were related as father and son is doubtful. Laksmanacandra is said to have been the son of Rudracardra and it was lie who conquered several chiefs wielding sway over the Himalayan territories.1490 Trimallacardra, the successor (and probably the son) of Lakşınararandra, is praised for his continual liberality to the learned men of Benares.74"] It was at the command of Baz Bahadursandra and for pleasing him that Anantadeva compiled his Sirtikaustubha.14 At the end Anantadeva tells us that Baz Babůdurcandra conquered secrii mountain forts in the Himalayas.!!3 After giving a pedigree of his patron's family Anantadevi gives some information about himself. He was a descendant of the great Maratha Saint Ekanātha whom he describes as endowed with Vidic s:1c1ifices and as a devotee

of Kļşņa.1494 That this Ekanātha is the same as the great Maratha saint is vouchsafed by Kāšjoátha, author of Dharma sindhu, in another work of his.1495 Anantadeva was the great great-grand-son of Ekanātha and he was the grandson of Ananta and son of Āpadeva, the author of the Mimāṁsā nyāyaprakāśa alias À padevi. Mimāṁsā lore seems to have been a hereditary endowment in the family as in the case of the Bhattas of Benares. In all his works, particularly in the Samskärakaustubha, Anantadeva applies at every step the maxims and doctrines of the Pärvamīmāṁsā for the decision of doubtful points of Dharmaśāstra. Anantadeva had a younger brother Jivadeva whose Gotrapravaranirnaya he draws upon in the Sanskārakaustubha after dealing with sāpindya for marriage in his own way. The quotation is a long one beginning with the words '314 07977faujant gritacasho Tal fenti ta' on p. 179 (b) of HEFTTTH (oblong Nir. edition of 1913 ) and ending on p. 196 ( a ) with the verse: ita & gara पण्डितजनालङ्कारचूडामणिोदातीर जनिर्गुणोच्चयखनिनाम्नापदेवोग्रणीः । तत्सूनोरिह जीवदेवकृतिनः सद्धर्मशास्त्रे कृतो गोत्रागां प्रवरैः सहेयमभवनिणीतिरीशार्पणम् ॥.

West and Bühler in their digest1497 thought that Ananta deva flourished about the same time as the author of the Nirņayasindhu. But this requires some correction. Baz Baha dur, the patron of Anantadeva, seems to have been a scion of

the Candra (or Chand ) family and ruled over Almora and Nainital from 1638 to 1678 A. D. It is said in the Imperial Gazetteerl498 that the first of the Chandrarājas was Somachand who hailed from Jhúsi near Allahabad and came to the Hima layan regions in the 10th century and that in 1563 the capital was transferred to Almora by Kalyancanda, whose son Rudra. candra was a contemporary of Akbar and made his obeisance to the latter in 1587 A. D. at Lahore. The Smrtikaustubha does mention the ancestors Kalyanacandra and Rudracandra of Baz Bahadur. Between Baz Bahadur and Rudracandra there are three names. Supposing that they are the three direct ascendants of Baz Bahadur and following a period of 25 years for each after Rudracandra's known date of 1587 A. D., we get the year 1662 A. D. for Baz Bahadur. We are told in the Gazetteer that in 1672 Baz Bahadur introduced a poll tax, the proceeds of which he remitted to Delhi as tribute. Therefore Anantadeva must have been patronised by Baz Bahadur between 1645 and 1675 A. D. A greater approximation can be made in another way. The saint Ekanātha finished his Marathi Bhagavata at Benares in sake 1495 and 1630 of the Vikrama era on Kārtika full-moon day (i. e. 9th November 1573) as he himself tells us. 1499 Anantadeva was the fourth in descent from him (exclusive of Ekanātha ). Counting 25 years for each of the four generations, Anantadeva should have been a grown up man in 1673 A. D. There are controversies about the dates of the birth and death of Ekanātha, the commonly accepted dates being sake 1450–1521 (b. 1528–d. 1600 A. D.). The date of his death is sake 1521 Phālguna dark half 6th day

( 25 February 1600). Others give 1548–1599 A. D. as the dates. Whichever date is correct, the literary activity of Anantadeva must be assigned to the third quarter of the 17th century. This date is confirmed by the fact that in the Asaucanirnaya of Jivadeva, younger brother of Anantadeva, the Nirnayasindhu composed in 1611-12 A. D. is cited as an authority. 
Doubts were expressed by some Marathi writers as to whether Ekanātha, mentioned as the ancestor of Anantadeva, is identical with the well-known Marathi poet and saint Ekanàtha. It is unnecessary in this work to discuss that matter. The present author holds that they are identical. Those interested may read the contribution of Dr. P. K. Gode in 'Studies in literary History' vol. II (for 1954) pp. 39-41. 
Anantadeva was a very learned man. He was at home in both Pùrvamimāṁsā and Dharmaśāstra. He wrote a learned commentary called Bhattālapkāra on Apadeva's Mimamsanyāya prakāśa. 
On p. 469 of the Smstikaustubha (Nir. ed.) Anantadeva refers to a work called Bhaktiviveka composed by his grand father (Anantadeva I, grandson of Ekanātha ). 
Anantadeva wrote many works on Dharmaśāstra. A few may be mentioned here. He composed Antyeștipaddhati (vide Prof. Velankara's Cat. No. 665 p. 209), Càturmāsyaprayoga (the same cat. p. 184 No. 575), Bhagavadbhaktinirnaya ( vide Velanakar's Cat. of Iccharam Desai collection (No. 231 ). On भगवन्नामकौमुदी of लक्ष्मीधर he wrote a commentary called Prakāśa ( vide Velankar's Cat. No. 115). 
115. Nāgojibbațţa 
The learning of Nāgojibhatta was of an encyclopaedic character. Though his special forte was Vyakaraṇa ( grammar) he wrote standard works also on poetics, dharmaśāstra, yoga and other sástras. The number of works ascribed to him is very large. Aufrecht in his Cat. Catalogorum, part I pp. 283 284 mentions 47 works as composed by him. Dr. P. K. Gode in volume III of his Studies in Indian Literary History' pp. 214–219 deals at some length with the works of Nāgoji on Vyakarana (Grammar ), Poetics and Dharmaśāstra (in its 
964

several branches ). On dharmaśāstra he composed several works, viz. Ācārendusekhara, Aśaucanirņaya, Tithindusekhara, Tirthendusekhara, Prayascittendusekhara or Prayascittasära samgraha, Sraddhendusekhara, Sapiņdimañjari and Sapindya dipikā or Sāpindyanirpaya. Of his far-famed works on the Papinian system, such as the Mahābhāsya-pradipoddyota, the Paribhāşendusekhara, the Vaiyakarañasiddhantamañjüşā, (in large and small recensions ), the Sabdendusekhara (big and small) and of his commentaries on the Kavyaprakāśa-pradipa, the Kuvalayānanda, the Rasagangadhara, the Rasatarangini, the Rasamañjari, nothing can be said here for want of space.

Some of Nàgojibhatta's (or Nagesabhatta's ) works on Dharmaśāstra may be mentioned here. He composed the Titbinirnayatattva containing 101 stanzas (in writing which he relied upon the conclusions of the Nirņayasindhu ).1500 The names of his works on Dharmaśāstra are mentioned in the note below.1501 Nāgoji's surname was Kāla (i. e. Kale in these days ) but in some Mss, it is given as Upadhyâya (vide note below ).1502

He composed works on Kavyaśāstra, such as the Kāvya pradipoddyota, the Rasagangadhara-marmaprakāśa ( Nir. ed.), and very learned works on Vyakarana ( grammar) such as the Paribhàşendusekhara (vide Dr. P. K. Gode’s ‘Relative chrono logy of Nāgoji's works“ in bis “Studies in Literary History' vol. III pp. 212-219). 
Någojibhatta was the son of Sivabhatta and Sati and was a Mahārāştra Brāhmaṇa surnamed Kala (Kale). At the beginning and end of several works of his (such as Rasagangadhara-marmaprakāśa, the Maõjūså ) he tells us that he was patronised by Rāma of the Bisena family,1503 the ruler of a city named śrågavera (which seems to be on the Ganges above Allahabad ). He was the pupil of Hari dikṣita,1504 son of Vireśvara and pupil of Rāmāśrama and grandson of the great grammarian Bhattoji-dikșita.150s Tradition says that he composed the grammatical work Sabdaratna and ascribed it to his teacher Haridiksita in gratitude. In the 1508 commentary on the Praudhamanoranā Haridikșita refers to the Sabdaratna as his own work and to the Sabdendusekhara as that of his pupil. 
Bhattojidikșita was a pupil of the Mimāṁsaka Sankara bhatta and of Šesa Srikrsna and almost a contemporary of Jagannāthapandita. Bhattoji's pupil Nilakantha śukla wrote a work in saṁvat 1663 ( Dr. Belvalkar in Systems of Sanskrit Grammar, p. 47). Therefore he flourished in the first half of the 17th century. For the date of Bhattoji, vide J. 0. I. (Baroda ) vol. IV pp. 33-36 and J. of Venkatesvara 0. I. vol. I part 2 pp. 117-127.

(pp. 188-199) and so Bhattoji, who was a pupil of Sankara bhatta, may be assigned to the period between 1575–1645 A. D. Någojibhatta was a pupil of Bhattoji's grandson. There fore Nāgojibhatta must have flourished towards the end of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. Någoji bhatta's literary activities, looking to his vast out-put, must have extended over a long period of more than 50 years.

p. 247, Mr. S. P. V. Ranganatha Syami makes Bhattoji a pupil of Šesa Vireśvara and not of Beşa Kțşpa. But the passage of the Manoramākucamardana, if properly interpreted, makes it clear that Bhattoji was the pupil of Sesa Kșspa and not of Vireśvara.1508 A ms. of Nāgojibhatta's commentary on the Rasamañjarī is dated samvat 1769, Māgha 7th bright half, Wednes day, i. e. 21st January 1713 A. D. ( vide 1. O. cat. vol. III p. 365). It is not unlikely that Någojibhatta first composed his commen taries on the comparatively easy śàstra of poetics and that he then worked upon Dharnasāstra and Vyakarapa. The edition of the Rasagangadhara in the Kavyamalà series says that there is a tradition that Nāgoji was invited by king Savai Jaising of Jaipur to a horse-sacrifice in 1714 A. D., but that Någoji declined on the ground of Kşetra-sainnyūsa. That Savai Jaising of Amber performed the Aśvamedha sacrifice was scouted by Prof. D. C. Sarakar, but long and forceful arguments have been advanced against this theory by Dr. P. K. Gode ( in his studies in literary history ', vol. III pp. 166-180) and in J. I. H. (Madras) vol. 15 pp. 364-367; vide also Poona Orientalist', vol. II pp. 166-178 for Savai Jaising. Therefore his literary activity must be placed between 1700 and 1750 A. D. Mahāmahopadhyāya Haraprasada Šāstri says (Ind. Ant. vol. 41 p. 12) that Någoji died about 1775. But this appears rather improbable. If one of his works was copied in 1713 A. D. he could hardly have lived up to 1775, unless he was about 100 years old at that time.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
116. Bālakṣsna or Bālambhatta The Lakşmivyākhyāna alias the Bālambhatti is a commentary on the Mītáksarā of Vijñānešvara, ascribed to a lady named Laksmidevi. The commentary is a voluminous one and displays uneven workmanship. The commentary on the acāra section of the Mitāksarā is the most learned part of the whole book and is almost an independent work. The late Mr. J. R. Gharpure published all the three parts on acara (pp. 626), Vyavahāra (pp. 402) and Prāyaścitta (pp. 220). The portion on Prayascitta is very meagre as compared with the portion of the com. on Acăra and Vyavahára. The commentary on the Prāyascitta portion of the Mitā kşarà covers in Mr. Gharpure's edition (published in 1924) 220 pages, while the Balambhatti on the ācāra and Vyavahāra sections in the same series is very exhaustive, covering respectively pp. 626 and pp. 402. 
In the Balambhatti the author quotes by name a host of writers and works. As the Balambhatti is almost the latest work of Dharmaśāstra worth special mention in this work, no useful chronological purpose will be served by giving the names of all such writers and works. It may, however, be stated that he names the Nirnayasindhu, the Viramitrodaya, the Mayükhas of Nilakantha, the Samskärakaustubha, Siddhesvarabhatta the nep hew of Nilakantha, Khandadeva the author of Bhättadipikä on the Mimāṁsāsútra, the Kayasthadharmapradipa of Gāgábhatta and the author's father's commentary thereon. 
Of the Bàlambbațți ascribed to Lakşmidevī, West and Bühler say 'she generally advocates latitudinarian views and gives the widest interpretation possible to every term of Yājñavalkya. Her opinions are held in comparatively small esteem and are hardly ever brought forward by the śāstris, if unsupported by other authorities '.1509 For example, in the Bālambhatti the word 
• bhràtaraḥ“, occurring in Yajñavalkya's verses laying down the order of succession to a man dying without male issue, is inter preted as including sisters and the author says that sisters succeed immediately after brothers. 510 This dictum of Balam

bhatta taken along with the words of the Vyavahāramayukha seems to have influenced their Lordships of the Privy Council in Vinayak v. Lakshmibai on the question of the rights of the sister as an heir.1511 In Sakharam v. Sitabai1512 Sir Michael Westropp C. J. went so far as to say on the construction of the term 'brethren' in the Mitākşarı as including sisters, which construction was adopted in that case (in Vinayak v. Lakshmi bai) both by the Supreme Court and the Privy Council, “ we must treat the Mitākṣarā also as preferring sisters to half brothers, whom it brings in after brothers.” But this was a mere obiter dictum, since the case in which these observations were made was governed by the law of the Vyavahăramayukha which ex pressly prefers full sisters to half brothers. It has been laid down in several cases in Bombayl513 that Bālambhatta's doctrine that the word "brothers' includes' sisters' has not been accepted in that Presidency and that Sir Michael Westropp was under a misapprehension as to the exact drift of the Bālambhatti which nowhere says that the term 'brothers' excludes half brothers and which does not bring in the full sister before the half bro ther, but expressly says that the full brother inherits first, then the half brother and then comes the sister. The Balambhatti not only brings in the sisters after full and half brothers, but places the sons and daughters of sisters after ibe sons and daughters of brother's, full or half. This is in direct conflict with the order of succession expressly mentioned by the Mitākșară and the Bombay High Court has refused to give the sister's son the place which the Bålambhatti assigns to him and treats him as a mere bandhu.1514 The Bālambhatti is regarded as of little authority in the interpretation of the Milàkşarī in the Bombay Presidency and its interpretations cannot be accepted without due caution and examination. 515 Even in the Benares1516 School where the Balam

History of Dharmaśästra 
bhatti has been accepted as one of the leading authorities, the authority of Balambhatta has been held to be inferior to that of Nandapandita in matters of adoption, it being held that a widow cannot adopt in the Benares School without express authority from her husband ( while Balambhatta holds that she can adopt without such authority). Similarly it has been held that the Balambhatti cannot prevail over the views of the Viramitrodaya and that a daughter-in-law is not in the line of heirs at all though the Balambhatti says that she is so.1517 
The author of the Bålambhatti is somewhat of an enigma. Such women as Silā, Vijjā, Avanti-sundari have been worshippers at the shrine of the Muse of Poetry. A lady has been associ ated with the composition of a work on Mathematics, viz. the Lilāvati. Inspiration for several works on Dharmaśāstra was, we know, derived from queens and princesses, as in the case of the Vivădacandra compiled by Queen Laksmidevi through Misaru miśra, the Dānavākyāvali compiled by Mahādevi Dhiramati of Mithila through Vidyapati, the Dvaitanirnaya composed by Vacaspati at the bidding of queen Jaya, wife of king Bhaira vendra. It gives one great pleasure to contemplate that at least one work on Dharmaśāstra, the Balambhattī, is claimed by a lady as her own. But this pleasure receives a rude shock if the question of the authorship of the Balambhatti is dispassionately considered. The introductory verses no doubt start by saying that Lakşmi, the wife of Vaidyanātha Payagunda, and the daughter of Mahădeva of the Mudgala gotra and surnamed Kherada composed the work, her maiden name being Umā.1518 The colophon at the end of the acåra portion says that the work was composed by Lakşmi, the daughter of Mahādeva and Umä, the wife of Vaidyanātha Payagunda and the mother of Bala

krsna.1519 At the end of the vyavahāra section in the printed editions we have the words 'mother of Lālākļşņa' but this is obviously a misreading of the mss. or a mistake of the copyists. The pretence that the work was composed by a lady is made extremely plausible by the frantic efforts made in it for the rights of women in matters of inheritance. But this pretence is not kept up in the body of the work at all. In several places the author of the Balambhatti refers to the Mañjüşı and other works of his guru and to works of his father.1520_We know that Vaidyanatha Payagunda was a pupil of Någojibnatta,152 1 who composed several Mañjūšis (on grammar) and a work on prāyaścitta. Therefore it follows either that the Balambhatti was composed by Vaidyanātha himself and ascribed to his wife or that the work was composed by Bālakršna alias Bàlambhatta, son of Vaidyanatha, and was ascribed to his mother. Nagoji. bhatta who certainly attained a very advanced age was the guru of Vajdyanàtha as well as of the latter's son Bālakṣşna. That Balakrsna or Balambhatta Payagunda was a learned man like his father Vaidyanatha follows fruill several circumstances. He wrote a work called Up.ikstitattva.1522 Gopala alias Manudeva, in his commentary called Laghubhūsanakanti on the Vaiyakara

nabhûşaņasára, styles Bālambhatta Payagunda his guru.1523 Looking to the colophons where Lakşmi is referred to as the mother of Balakrsna and to the fact that the work is known as Bålambhatti, we must conclude that it was composed by Balam bhatta and not by his father Vaidyanātha. What motive impelled Bālambharta to publish the work in the name of his mother it is difficult to say. Tradition says that he did so to console Lakşmidevi in her bereavement on the death of a child. Vaidya nātha composed several commentaries on grammatical works such as on the Mahābhāsyapradipoddyota of Nāgojibhatta, on the Paribhàșendusekbara (com. called Kåskā and Gadā), on the Vaiyakarana-siddhantamañjúşă (com. called Kalā), on the Laghuśabdendusekhara (com. Cidasthimālā ), on the Laghu sabdaratna (com. Bhavaprakāśa). Mr. Govinda Das (p. 27 in Mr. Gharpure's edition of acāra portion ) says that these works were really composed by Bālambhatta and ascribed to his father. In these grammatical works the names of Vaidyanatha's parents are given as Mabadeva and Veni. 
The 1. O. cat. (pp. 458-59, No. 1507) notices an incom plete work called Dharmaśāstrasamgraha compiled by Bālasarman Pāyagunda, son of Vaidyanātha and Lakşmi and patronised 1524 by Colebrooke. The work dealt with topics of civil law, viz. definition of vyavahāra, sabhā, the judge, the sabhyas, the rela tive strength of smstis etc., return of debts etc. It breaks off at folio 79. On the ms, there is a note in Colebrooke's own hand (which is not complimentary to the honesty of Balasar

man) dated 1st May 1800; “fresh sheets were received from Balaśarma Payagunda on this date. This is little else but the Viramitrodaya revised. As it is a scarce book and very little known Bàlasarma and his pupil Manudeva did not suspect, I could detect the plagiarism.” 
The foregoing show's that Balakrsna Payagunda was a Deccani Brāhmaṇa, that his father and mother were Vaidya nàtha and Laksmi, that his maternal grandfather was Mahadeva, also a Deccani Brāhmana surnamed Kheradā, that he was the pupil of Nāgojibhatta and that he was a pandit of Colebrooke Mr. Govinda Das is not right when he identifies (p. 27) Vaidya nātha the commentator of several grammatical works of Nago jibhatta with Vaidyanātha the author of several commentaries on Alankāra works (such as the Udāharaṇacandrikà on Kavya prakāśa and the Prabhii on the Kavyapradipa ). The reasons are two. Vaidyanatha, author of the Udàharaṇacandrikā, was the son of Rāmabhatta, son of Vitthala Tatsat, while Vaidya nātha the granımarian was a son of Mahādeva and Veņi. Besides the Udàharanacandrika was composed1526 in samvat 1740 Kārtika śuddha 8, Wednesday (i. e. 17th October 1683 ). We saw above that Vaidyanātha Payagunda was a pupil of Nāgoji, who flouri shed towards the end of 17th and the first half of the 18th century. If Vaidyanātha, the writer on poetics, were the same as the commentator of Nāgoji, he could not have composed a a work on poetics so early as 1683 A. D. Dr. Belvalkar (Systems of Sanskrit Grammar p. 60) says . Lakşmidevi, the wife of king Candrasimha of Mithila, was probably his patro ness in whose honour he is reported to have composed a commentary on the Vyavahārakānda of the Mitaksarà.' This throws to the winds all chronology. We saw above (pp. 399 and 404 ) that the Mithila princess Lakşmi or Lachimadevi flourished in the first half of the 15th century, while the Bălambhatti quoting, as it does, writers and works like Gåga

bhatta and the Kaustubha could not have been composed before 1700 A. D. 
Mr. Govinda Das says that a ms, of the acarakanda of the Bålambhatti in the Benares palace library is dated samvat 1831 (i. e. 1774-75 A. D.). The I. O. cat. (pp. 458-459 ) notices that Bālambhatta was about 80 years old when Colebrooke entrusted the Dharmaśāstrasamgraha to him about 1800 A. D. Besides both Balambhatta and his father Vaidyanātha were the pupils of Nāgojibhatta. The ms. of the Upåkrtitattva (Stein's Jammu cat. p. 302) is dated savivat 1848 i. e. 1791-92 A. D. and the ms. of the Laghubhūşanakānti of Bàlambhatta's pupil is dated sarvat 1856 ( i. e. 1799–1800 A. D.). Hence is follows that Bālambhatta must have flourished between 1730 and 1820 A. D. Mr. Govinda Das says that Balambhatta died at the age of 90 and gives his dates as 1740 to 1830 A. D. (p. 29 of Mr. Gharpure's ācāra section of Bālambhatti at the end ).

Kasinātha Upadhyāya or Bābā Padhye composed an extensive work called Dharmasindhusāra or Dharmābdhisāra, which is popularly known as Dharmasindhu. It is now the leading work in matters of religious observances in the Deccan and has been referred to even in judicial decisions. 1526 It has been published several times. In the following the Nirnayasagara edition of 1936 has been used. He says that he consulted former nibandhas and, following the order of the subject-matters in the Nirnaya sindhu, composed the work which sets forth only the establi shed conclusions after eliminating the original smsti texts.1537

He ( Kāśinātha Upadhyâya) expressly mentions Madhavā. cārya in the Introductory verse (3) and states that he consulted former nibandhas such as the Nirnayasindhu that establish con clusions ( in matters of Dharma). He sometimes employs the very words of the Nirņayasindhu as, for instance, on defining Vaisnava and Smärta. 
The following are among the principal authors and works mentioned by the Dharmasindhu : Akhandadarśa, Agnipuràņa, Kalatattvavivecana (frequently ), Kaustubha ( frequently), Gphyā gniságara, Puruşărthacintamani, Parijäta, Pūrtakamalākara, Bhaktinirnaya, Bhattoiidiksita, Bhāskararāya (described as Navinatara on p. 77), Mahārnava, Mâdhava, Muhûrta-Cintā. mani, Muhurtamārtanda, Ramarcanacandrikā, Santimayukha, śāntisāra, Śūdrakamalakara, Śrāddhasāgara, Såpindyadipikā. 
The Dharmasindhu is divided into three paricchedas (sections) and contains 433 closely printed pages (in the Nir. ed. of 1936). The first pariccheda covers 34 pages and deals with the divisions of the year, seasons, months ( lunar, solar, savana, nāksatra, Bārhaspatya ), discussion on matters to be avoided on certain days and tithis and to be performed on them. The 2nd pari ccheda ( covering pp. 35-116 ) deals with religious acts to be done in the several months from Caitra onwards to Phålguna and p. 115 states that authoritative texts should be found from works like Kaustubha, Nirnayasindhu, and those of Madhava. The third pariccheda is divided into two parts, the first covering pp, 117–314 and the second covering pp. 315-433. The first part of the third parichheda deals with the Samskāras from Garbhadhāna onwards. In each case it starts with the considera tion of proper times (months, tithis, the week days, the astro logical yogas ) and discusses the results of eclipses, night, even ing and other times for different acts; Nārāyanabali, Nàgabali, listening to the recitation of Harivamśa, adoption of a son and discussion about the gotra of an adopted son and his sapiņda relationship; other rites like punisarana, șasthīpájana, Šānti such

History of Dharmaśāstra 
was Kāšyupadhyāya who had two sons Yajñeśvara and Ananta. Ananta was a very pious man and a great devotee and left his native land Konkana, and resided at Pandharpur on the Bhima. The Dharmasindhu does not give the reason for Ananta's migration from Konkaņa. But it is said that the Padhyes bad a dispute with another family about the upadhye vrtti, took it for decision to the Peshwa's Court at Pouna and were defeated, on which they cursed the Peshwa, vowed not to stay in the territories under the Peshwa's rule and migrated to Pandharpur. Vide \#1. 5. H. H.for sake 1833 p. 100 for the judgement deli vered in 1762 A. D. in the dispute between Joshi and Padhye. The Dharmasindhu was composed 1630 in sake 1712 i. e. 1790–1 A. D. Kāśinātha was related to the great Marathi poet Moro pant, as his daughter Avadi was married to Ramakršņa, the second son of the poet. He had great veneration for Moropant and refers to the Mantrabhagavata of the latter.1531 Kasinātha became a samnyäsin and died in sake 1727 i. e. 1805-6 A. D.1582

several Pandits (whose names are given in the note below ) 1633 to compile a digest in Sanskrit; this was translated into Persian and the Persian version was rendered into English by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed with a long Preface in English in which on P. XLIV he quotes the Gità verse ( II. 22) - Vásāmsi Jirņāni' in original Sanskrit. Vide for this I. O. Cat. p. 458. This was a very unsatisfactory work. Another attempt was made by Trivedi Sarvorušarman who compiled in 1789 for Sir William Jones another Digest of law called Vivàdasàrårņava1534 in nine tarangas. This digest was suggested by Sir William Jones and two parts of it on contracts and succession were translated by Colebrooke in 1796. The translation was first published in 1797 A. D. and is known to the legal profession as Colebrooke's Digest. This work exercised great influence over the courts in their administration of Hindu Law in the early days. The work is divided into dvipas, each dvipa being subdivided in to ratnas. The principal topics dealt with are : recovery of debts, deposits, sale without ownership, partnership, rescission of gifts, non payment of wages, rescission of sale and purchase, emancipa tion from slavery, disputes between master and servant, duties of man and wife, inheritance and partition. Jagannatha is said to have died at the venerable age of 111 in 1806.1535 Vide ‘ Dictionary of Indian Biography' by C. E. Buckland published in 1906, where on p.415 the dates of his birth and death are put as 1695–1806 A. D. with question marks against both dates. It is said the date of his birth is based on tradition.' He had a wonderful memory, became a remarkable logician and unrivalled his knowledge of Hindu Law; he was consulted by Sir William Jones and Harr ington, he was held in great respect by the highest Hindu nobles

Though Jagannātha exercised great influence in moulding Hindu Law in Bengal, his work has been held from very early times not to have any binding authority in Western India.1836 
119. Conclusion 
In the foregoing pages most of the classical works and the most prominent writers on Dharmaśāstra during a period of about twenty-five centuries have been passed in review. The number of authors and works on dharmaśāstra is legion. All these numberless authors and works were actuated by the most laudable motives of regulating the Aryan society in all matters, civil, religious and moral, and of securing for the members of that society happiness in this world and the next. They laid the greatest emphasis on the duties of every man as a member of the whole Aryan society, as a member of the particular class to which he belonged and very little emphasis on the privileges of men. They created great solidarity and cohesion among the several classes of the Aryan society in India in spite of their conflicting interests and inclinations and enabled Hindu society to hold its own against successive aggre ssions of foreign invaders. They preserved Hindu culture and literature in the midst of alien cultures and in spite of bigoted foreign domination. There is no doubt that the authors on dharmaśāstra in their desire to evolve order out of chaos and to adjust and harmonise the varying practices of people with the dicta of ancient sages were guilty of the faults of raising hair-splitting arguments, divisions and sub-divisions and also of thinking that religious rites and formularies were the be-all and end-all of human existence. But living as, most of the later writers did, in the midst of aggressive and violently unsympathetic cultures and rulers and possessing no powerful central government that sympathised with their ideals, they were driven more and more to revolve within their own narrow grooves and could not see far in order to regulate society in a free and buoyant spirit.

Brief Note on Dharmasastra Works and Writers 
from Kāmarūpa (i, e. Assam ) 
Raghunandana in his Smstitattva several times mentions * Kamarūpiya-nibandha'. For example, in ( vol. I) Tithitattva 587 p. 86, Prayaścitta p. 555, Malamāsa p. 820; (vol. II ) Ekadasi tattva p. 102. The Tithitattva (p. 76 ) says that the Smstisagara quotes the Matsyasūkta' and the Prāyaścittatattva (p. 535) says that the Smstisagara is Kāmarūpiya-nibandha. It may be noted that on pp. 530 and 532 of the Prayascittatattva (vol. I) a work entitled Smstisagarasåra is cited and verses of Bịhad-Angiras are quoted from it. The Nirnayasindhu under the topic of 
mahầnavami' (p. 186 of Nir, edition of 1935) mentions Kama rūpa-nibandha and quotes the same verse as is quoted by Raghunandana (in vol. I. p. 86 ) as from Smrtisāgara, a Kama rūpiya nibandha. 
On the occasion of the 22nd session of the All-India Ori ental Conference held at Gauhati (Assam ) in January 1965 a 
Prāgjyotisa souvenir' was published by Dr. Maheswara Neog (Local Secretary of that Conference). Among the several papers contained in that souvenir, Pandit Manaranjan Sastri, Principal of the Sanskrit College at Nalbari (Assam ), contributes (on pp. 91-114 ) a very interesting and informative paper on the Kāmarüpa School of Dharmaśāstra. In the brief account that I present here I can refer only to a few salient points.

History of Dharmaśāstra 
One of the early and famous writers from Kāmarüpa is Nilàmbaràcărya. He is credited with the authorship of four works viz. (i) Amśaprakāśikā, a Com. on the Vişnupuråna; (ii) Sraddhaprakāśa or Śrāddhabhāsya; (iii) Kalakaumudi (on the appropriate times for religious acts and rites ) and (iv) Candraprabhā - a digest of Smsti material dealing with sins and prāyaścittas to be performed for the removal of the effects of sins. He tells us little about himself. At the end of the Sraddha prakāsa he tells us that his father was a learned man named Sarkarsana and gave himself up at the confluence of the Ganges with the ocean. He learnt the śāstras from his father. He holds the view that the word māsa means by itself the lunar ( càndra ) month, while other Kamar ūpa writers held and hold till these days the view that māsa means Saura ( solar ) month. As Sula pāņi in his Durgotsavaviveka, and Govindananda in the Suddhi kaumudi (p. 275 ) mention him, he must be earlier than about 1375 A. D. and as he mentions the Kalpataru, Jimůtavāhana, Govindarāja, Bhavadevabhatta, he must be later than about 1225 A.D. In his Śräddhaprakāśa ( when treating of adhimāsas' intercalary months) he says that he himself has observed about intercalary months, certain irregularities and mentions šake 1199 (i, e. 1277 A. D.) as the year in which the irregularity occurred. So Nilämbara must have flourished between 1240 and 1300 A. D. 
The Kālakaumudi is mentioned several times by Raghu nandana e. g. vol. I, Tithi pp. 73, 129, 141 and (vol. II) in Ekādasitattva p. 51. A work called Smstisagara is quoted several times by Raghunandana e. g. ( in Vol. I) Tithi p. 76 ( three verses are quoted as from Matsyasūktà cited by Smstisāgara ), Tithi p. 86 (Smstisagara is a Kamar ipiyanibandha ), Präyaścitta-tattva p. 474 ( quoting Devala ), Prayascitta-tattva p. 554 cites Smsti sāgara quoting Yama and Matsyatantra, (vol. I. p. 555 ); Ragu nandana also quotes Smstisagara (vol. I. Prayascittatattva pp. 530, 532 one verse on each page quoted from Bịhad-Angiras ). It is clear from the above passages that the word 'Kamarūpiya' 
• Kamarūpanibandha' is pot the name of one work, but that it is a general name for works composed by scholars from Kamarupa. 
The Matsyasůkta is frequently quoted by Raghunandana, as in (vol. I) Tithi. p. 86, Malamāsa. p. 814, Saṁskāra p. 886; (in vol. II.) pp. 61, 69,83 ( several verses ), 141 ( when Stridhvani is śubha Ekadasi pp. 61, 69, 83; Udvaha p. 141. 
Brife Note on Works from Kamarupa

Six verses from Svalpamatsyapurāna are cited by Raghu nandana in (vol. II) Chandogavssotsargatattva p. 537 (bearing on 
the Sraddba of a man's father.). For some details about this work, vide Journal of Ganganath Jha Research Institute, vol. IX parts 2-4, November 1953. The first five chapters are only a summary of the first six chapters of the Matsya-purāņa. The interlocators are God incarnated as Matsya and the hearer is sage Manu. 
Recently (in December 1964) Dr. P. C. Choudhury (Direc tor of the Department of Historical and Antiquarian Studies, Assam) published a work edited by Pandit Manoranjan Shastri and himself entitled 'Smstijyotisasāra-saigraha' containing three Dharmaśāstra works from Kamarüpa viz. I. Smstisagarasāra by Damodaramiśra (composed in śake 1308 i. e. 1386 A, D.) 76 pages; II Grahaņakaumudi (pp. 79-121 ) by Mahāmahopadhyāya Pitām bara-Siddhāntavāgisabhattācārya, the most famous among Kamarüpa writers on Dharmaśāstra (composed in sake 1530 i. e. 1608 A. D.); III. Jyotirmālā (pp. 125–163 ) on several astro logical matters by Lakşmipati in sake 1613 ( 1691 A. D.). 
It appears from the 2nd Introductory verse of the Smrti. sågarasāra that it was epitome of a vast work and was condensed as Smstisagarasāra for the benefit of the sons and pupils of Damodaramisra1638 and it was compiled in sake 1308 (i. e. 1386 A. D.). That it is a mere epitome is made clear in various places by the words vidhistu mūle' p. 43 or Vistarastu mūle (p. 73). It criticizes Nilambara1639 and mentions many works that preceded him, such as Kalpataru (p. 36), Jimüta vāhana, Rajamārtanda (p. 69), and BỊhad-Rājamārtaņda (pp. 63, 65), several Purānas etc. 
The colophon at the end of Grahana-kaumudi declares that Pitambara was patronized by the king Laksminārāyaṇa of Kamarūpa. He quotes numerous authorities and in the Grahana kaumudi he quotes the Kștyacintāmaņi several times e. g. pp.

101, 102, 103 and 118). In his Pragjyotisa Souvenir Pandit Manoranjana Sastri points out (on p. 107) that one Pandit 
Taranath Goswami of Gauripur mentions 18 works called Kau mudis as composed by Pitambara-Vāgisa, while another Pandit adds ten more Kaumudis, as composed by Pitambara ( in all 28 ) and Pandit ·Manoranjana Sastri gives his own list of 31 Kau mudis of Pitambara (pp. 108-116 of Prágjyotişa Souvenir ). Pandit Manoranjana Sastri postulates that Pitambara lived for about 90 years from about 1525 to 1615 A. D. (Prāgjyotisa Sou venir, p. 111). 
The printed Smộtitattva apparently mentions three works called Smstisāgara, Smstisăgarasăra and Smộtisàrasagara. This last, is quoted only once by Raghunandana (vol. I Tithi p. 181, three verses) and it appears to the present author a copyist's mistake (for Smstisagarasāra ). 
Besides these three, there are other Kamarūpa writers on Dharmaśāstra, such as Vedācàrya author of a Dharmaśāstra digest called Smsti-ratnākara (vide Journal of the Assam Research Society, Hemachandra Goswami Commemoration vol. XIV, 1960 pp. 63-77). 
There is a large field for work by Kàmarüpa scholars on the Dharmaśāstra works composed in Assam during the last seven or eight centuries. 
APPENDIX A. 
List of Works on Dharmaśāstra It is necessary to say a few words about the methods followed in preparing this list of the works on dharmaśāstra. Purely srauta works have generally been excluded, except where they have been profusely quoted or relied upon by dharmaśāstra writers. Works of the Tantra class and the Puràņas have been passed over, inas-much as they form in themselves independent and extensive branches of Sanskrit literature requiring an exhaustive and detailed treatment, which from considerations of space had to be abandoned here. All individual prayogas, māhātmyas, vidhis, vratas, śāntis, stotras have been omitted, except where the names of the authors are well-known or there is some importance or peculiarity attaching to them. Purely astrological works on jātaka, and tājika have not been included, but works of the muhůrta class that are closely connected with everyday religious practices have been included. Though the gshyasūtras and their commentaries were not dwelt upon in the body of the present work, they have been included in this list as their subject-matter is closely allied to dharmaśāstra. Only works up to about 1820 A. D. have been entered here. Works on politics ( arthaśāstra ) have also been included. I am afraid that all the restrictions set out above have not been rigorously observed in the following and crave the indulgence of scholars in this respect. I must gratefully acknowledge, as everyone engaged in preparing a similar list on any branch of post-Vedic literature must do, my indebtedness to the monumental Catalogus Cata logorum of Dr. Aufrecht. But even that catalogue leaves many things doubtful and necessarily gives meagre information. For removing such doubts I was compelled to read and compare the the original catalogues of Sanskrit mss. such as that of the India Office, the Notices of Sanskrit mss. by Dr. Mitra and M. M. Haraprasada. Besides the third part of Aufrecht's Catalogue was published in 1903. Since then several other catalogues, such as the Descriptive Catalogues and Triennial Catalogues of the Madras Govt. mss. Library, Notices of mss. (new series, part III) by M. M. Haraprasada Šāstri, Catalogue of Palmleaf and Paper mss. of Nepal Durbar Library by M. M. Haraprasada Šāstri, Hultzsch's Report (part III ), Catalogue of Central Provinces Sanskrit mss. by Rai Bahadur Hiralal and Catalogue of the mss. collected by

. 
the Bihar and Orissa Govt. (vol. I), have been published. More over I have consulted hundreds of mss. from collections like those at the Deccan College (now in the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute at Poona), at the Anandásrama Institution (Poona ), the Bhadkamkar memorial collection started by Prof. H. D. Velankar in Bombay at the Wilson College and the vast collection of the Baroda Oriental Institute. In preparing this list I give, wherever possible and desirable, the names of the authors and of their ancestors, the names of the works quoted by them or of the works that quote them, the age of the work (or of the mss.) their contents &c. In most cases the very name of the work indicates its subject matter. In spite of all this many doubtful points are still left. Various circumstances tend to create con fusion in preparing such lists as are offered here. The same work appears under two, three or even more names in the mss. and the catalogues. Sometimes the names of the authors and even their fathers' names are the same as in the case of Divākara, son of Mahadeva and Sankara, son of Nilakantha. Very often portions of a large work appear separately as distinct works in the Catalogues. The same author appears under several forms, as Narasimha and Nșsisha, Nāgesa and Nāgoji. I have made great efforts to remove such doubts as far as I could and hope that I have been able to make my own humble contributions to the work so ably done by Aufrecht and others. I do not give references to catalogues in the case of each work, nor do I give all possible references to catalogues against each entry. Only in important cases have 1 given references to catalogues. It has been my endeavour to give earlier references to work and authors wherever I could, than those given by Aufrecht and to find out the age of a work or author by resort to various devices. Only a detailed comparison with Aufrecht can show this, which task I must, in all humility, leave to the readers who will use this list. One more feature of this list to which I wish to draw the attention of the reader is that I have pointed out what works have been printed. In doing this I generally refer only to well-known series and editions like the Bombay Sanskrit series, the Benares Sanskrit series and have not set out editions to which very few can have access. For those who want exhaustive information on this point, the catalogues of printed works in the British Museum Library which have now been brought up to 1928 will be found helpful.

APPENDIX B 
LIST OF AUTHORS ON DHARMASÁSTRA 
While preparing this list, great difficulties were experienced in stating all the works composed by an author. In the case of such names as Ananta, Krsna, Gangadhara, Nārāyaṇa, Rama kļşņa, Sankara which are extremely common, the only method that could be followed, in the absence of materials to identify the authors bearing these names, was to place the same name several times in the list against the work composed by that author. Since the authors themselves very often convey no more informa tion than their own names and since some of the reports on the search for mss. do not give even what little information about the author can be gathered from the ms. of his work, Aufrecht also was compelled to follow this method. In order to avoid repetition and save space, I have not repeated in this list the in formation that was given under the works contained in the list A. Dates are given principally under the names of authors and sometimes under works also. For further information readers will have in many cases to refer to the works put down as com posed by an author. In the case of authors who have written on several sastras, their works on dharmaśāstra alone have been mentioned. Wherever possible parentage has been noted and dates assigned. In a few cases information which became avail able after list A was prepared has been incorporated here.
