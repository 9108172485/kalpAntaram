CHAPTER XIX 

DEVAYAJÑA 

Devayajña --As stated in the Tai. Ār. quoted above ( p. 696 ) the Devayajña was performed by offering fuel sticks into fire. According to the Ap. Db. S. I. 4. 13. 1, Baud. 1688 Db. S. II. 6. 4 and Gaut. V. 8-9, the Devayajña consisted in offering into fire offerings ( of food or at least a fuel stick ) with 'svāhā' uttered after the name of the deities in the dative case. Manu also (III. 70 ) looks upon homa as devayajña. The devatās to whom homa or devayajña was offered are different according to different gshya or dharma sūtrae. For example, Ašv. gr. ( I. 2. 2) says that they are the deities of the Agnihotra (1. e. Sürya or Agni, and Prajāpati), Soma Vanaspati, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Heaven and earth, Dhanvantari, Indra, the Viśve Devas, Brahman'. According to Gaut. they are Agni, Dhanvantari, Visve Devas, Prajāpati, Agni Svistakst. Vide Mādava-gphya II. 12. 2 where the deities are different from those in Aśv. gr. and Gaut. In later smrtis a distinction is made between homa (or devayajña ) and devapūjā. Yāj. in I. 100 speaks of the worship of gods immediately after tarpana and then in I. 102 includes homa among the five yajñas. Manu II. 176 also makes this distinotion. Medieval writers came to look upon Vaišvadeva as the devayajña, while others held that home to gods was different from Vaišvadeva. Vide Haradatta 1886 on Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 13. 1. According to Marici and Hārita quoted in the Smrtimuktāphala ( abnika p. 383 ) devapūjā is performed after the morning homa or after brahmayajñs and tarpana 1687 in the noon. In medieval and modern times the ancient idea of homa

roceded far into the back-ground and its place was taken by an elaborated procedure of devapūjā ( worship of images kept in the house ). Some space must be devoted to the origin and develop ment of this phase of religious practice. 

It is extremely doubtful whether images were generally worshipped in the ancient Vedic times. In the Rgveda and the other Vedas, there is worship of Agni, the Sun, Varuņa and various other deities; but they were worshipped in the abstract, &g powers and manifestations of the oue Divine Person or as separate deities or funotions bebind natural phenomena or cosmio processes. There are no doubt paesages where the deities of the Rgveda are spoken of as possessed of bodily attributes. A few verses may be cited in this connection. Indra is described in Rg. VIII. 17. 8 as 'tuvigriva' (with a powerful or thick Deck) and 'vapodara' (having big or capacious belly) and 'subāhu' (having well-sbaped arms). Rg. VIII. 17. 5 speaks of the limbs and sides of Indra and prays Indra to taste honey with his tongue. In Rg. X. 96.8 Indra is spoken as having dark green (hari) hair and beard and in X. 105.7 again it is said that the hair on his chin are dark-green and his ohin is never injured ( in battle ). 1688 In Rg. II. 33.5 Rudra is said to be 'pdūdara' (whose abdomen is soft ), * babbru '(of brown colour ) and suśipra '( with a fine chin or nose). The Vāj. 8. 16, 7 speaks of Rudra as having a dark-blue throat and red ( complexion) and 16. 51 says he wears a skin ( kftti). In Rg. I. 155. 6 Vişnu is said to approach a battle with his huge body and as a youth (*bphac-charira' and * yuvā'). In Rg. IIL 53. 6 Indra is asked to go home at once after drinking Somas, as he has a charming wife and delightful house. In Rg. X. 26.7 god Pūşan is said to shake his beard. In Rg. IV. 53.2 Savitis said to put on a yellowish drūpi (armour) and in Rg. I. 25. 13 Varupa is said to wear & golden drāpi. It is not necessary to multiply examples. It is possible to argue that all these descriptions are poetic and metaphoric. But there are two passages of the Rgveda that cause much more diffioulty than the above. Rg. IV. 24. 10 asks' who will 1689 purchase this

my Indra for ten cows and might return it after he ( Indra ) bas killed enemies'? Rg. VIII. 1. 5 says '0 Indra! I shall not give thee for even a great price, not even for a hundred, a thou sand or an ayuta ( ten thousand)'. It may be argued that here there is a reference to an image of Indra. But this is not con vinging. It is equally possible to hold that these are hyperbolic or boastful statements of the great devotion of the worshipper to Indra and that there is no reference to an image of Indra. If we look at the Vedio cult described in the Brāhmaṇas where sacri fices of butter, cakes and boiled rice or other grain are offered to several deities in the fire, or animal and some sacrifices are described at great length, it is clear that the ancient sages hardly ever thought of the worship of idols, but of deities in the abstract to whom they ascribed different functions and poetically represented them as being endowed like human beings with hands and feet and other limbs. It cannot be denied that here and there occur a few passages that suggest images as objects of worship. For example, in the Tai. Br. II. 6. 17 occurs the passage may the hotę priest worship the three goddesses, that are golden, that are endowed with beauty ( or ornaments ) that are great ones' &o. It looks as if golden images of the three goddesses are meant. 1690 One can say without much feer of contradiction that the religious practices among the higher strata of the Vedio Aryans did not include the worship of images in the house or in temples. But we have hardly any literary materials for judg ing what the religious practices of the lower or ignorant masses of Vedic India were. In Rg. VII. 21. 5 Vasişthe prays to Indra 'may the siśna-devas not overwhelm our fta' (religious order or practices ); similarly in Rg. X. 99. 3 the prayer is 'may be ( Indra ) striking (or killing ) the siśnadevas overcome them by his form or power'. Scholars are sharply divided in opinion about the meaning of the word "691'sisnadeva'. Some hold that it denotes people who were worshippers of the phallus (vide Vedio Index, vol. II. p. 382 ). Others hold that the word is used in & secondary or metaphorical sense for those who are immersed in sexual gratification and do not recognize anything else (as worthy of pursuit). Yāska in his Nirukta (IV. 19) quotes

Rg. VII. 21. 5 and explains that the word means 'those who do not observe rules of brahmacarya (celibacy). The preponderance of authority and evidence is in favour of the second view. In Rg. VII. 104.14(=Atharva VIII. 4. 14), the poet pleads if I be addicted to falsehood, O fire, or if I call upon the gods in vain (then you may injure me), but (not being so) why are you angry with me? May those whose speech is false incur slaughter at your hands'. Here 'anţta-devāḥ' is praoti. cally the same as 'drogba-vacaḥ' in the fourth pāda. In the Tai. Up. I. 11. 2 we have the words 'mātědevo bhaya, pitrdevo bhava', where all that is meant is that one should be devoted to the parents'. Therefore 'śiśna-deva' could hardly mean * those who worship phallus as god'. In Rg. 169. X. 87.2 Agni is invoked as follows 'with thy tongue reach the mūradevas, in thy mouth envelope the eaters of raw flesh after cutting them into bits' and in Rg. VII. 104, 24 Indra is called upon to kill male and female yātudhānas (evil spirits or sorcerers) and it is added 'may the müradevas perish bereft of their necks and may they not see the sun rising up fron the horizon'. Yaska in commenting on Rs. X. 4. 4 explains 'müra' as 'mūdha' (stupid ) 1683. It is possible to take 'mūra' as meaning 'mortal. or 'perishable' (since the root 'mp' assumes the form 'muriya' as in Rg. VII. 104. 15). From the above quotations it is clear that the Rgvedic poets know of low people who practised witohcraft, who were müradeyas (i. e. either worshipped peri. shable objects or were stupid in their cult) and who were the enemies of the Aryans. There are also clear references to enemies who did not look upon Indra as God (Rg. X. 27. 6, 

X. 48. 7, X. 86. 1). 

Phallio emblems have been found in the ancient ruins at Mohenjo-daro (vide Sir John Marshall's work, vol. I. pp. 58-63). Except these finds the earliest known lingas so far discovered do not go beyond the first century B. O. But centuries before Ohrist the worship of images had become widespread in India, According to Haradatta on Ap. gr. 20.1-3, where the offerings to

Isana, his consort and his son 'Jayants' (the conqueror Skanda) are desoribed, images of these three are worshipped. The Mānava. gshya 1494 II. 15. 6 prescribes that if an image (of wood, stone or metal) were to be burnt down or to become reduced to powder (of itself) or falls (from its pedestal) or breaks into pieces, or laughs, or moves to another place, the householder (in whose houge it had been established ) should offer ten oblations into fire with certain Vedio verses. In the Baud. gr. II. 2. 13 when describing the ceremony of Upaniskramana ( taking the infant child out of the house for the first time ) it is said that the father after performing homa goes out of the house, worships the images outside (the house ), feeds the brahmanas, makes them pronounce benedictions and then brings back to the house the infant. 1995 The Laugākşi grhya (18.3 ) speaks of devatāyatana (s temple). Gaut. (IX. 13-14 ) forbids a man from answering calls of nature in front of images or from stretching one's feet towards them and (IX.. 66 ) requires & man to circumambulato & temple ( devatāyatana ) that he may meet on his way. The Šān. gr. IV. 12. 15 does the same and uses the same word (8. B. E. vol. 29, p. 125 ) and in II. 6. 6 mentions & deva-kula ( god's house). Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 11. 30. 28 ) has a similar rule. Manu (II. 176 ) directs the brahmacārin to worship images, requires a person to circumambulate images that he may meet with when on a journey (IV. 39), not to cross the shadow of images (IV. 130 ) and ordains that witnesses be sworn in the presence of the images of gods and brāhmaṇas (VIII. 87). Vide also Manu III. 117 and IX. 285. The Vişnu Dh. 8. ( 23, 34, 63.27) mentions the images of gods ( devatārca ) and speaks of the worship of Bhagavat Vasudeva as an image. In Vasiştha XI. 31, Vişņu Dh. S. 69.7, 30. 15,70 13, 91. 10 the word 'deve. tāyatana ' or devāyatana occurs. Unfortunately the dates of all these works are far from being certain. But no scholar will assign the Mānava, Baudhāyana and Sankhyāyana gļhyasūtras and the dharmasūtras of Gautama and Apastamba to & later date than the 5th or 4th century B.C. Panini, whom no scholar will place later than 300 B. C. (though there are some who

place him geveral centuries earlier), teaches 1986 that an image by attending on which a person maintains himself and which is not for sale has the same name as the god whose image it is 8. g. an image is called Siva or Skanda when the worshipper makes his livelihood by attending on the image of Siva or Skanda (and appropriating the offerings placed before the image) which is not for sale. Panini also teaches (IV. 3. 98 ) that * Vasudevaka' is a person who is & votary of Vāsudeva and Patañjali expressly says that Vāsudeva was not a mere ksatriya, but that the word is the name of God. Patañjali comments on the former sūtra and vouchsafes the very interesting information that the Mauryas who were greedy of gold established or manufactured insges, to which this rule would not apply, but it would apply to the images of gods that were in Patañjali's day used for pūjā ( worship). According to Patañjali the images manufactured by the Mauryas would be called Sivaka &c. Patañjali, while commenting on Pāṇini IV. 1. 54, gives as examples an image with a long or high nose. The Adiparva 70. 49, Anušāsana 10. 20-21, Āśvamedhika 70. 16 speak of devatāyatanas ( temples ) and Bhisma 112. 11 in speaking of terrible portents refers to images in temples trembling and shedding tears. Khāravela, king of Kalinga (latter half of 2nd century B.O.) is said to have re-established an image of Jina carried away by Nandarāja and be is described as 'sarva devāyatana-sankhāra-karaka'( one who looked after the preber vation and repair of all temples ). In Kautilya's Arthasāstra II. 4 ( variously assigned to different dates from 300 B. C. to 250 A. D. ) it is stated that in the centre of the capital shrines of Aparājita, Apratihata, Jayanta, Vaijayanta and temples of Siva, Asvins, Vaisravana, Lakşmi and of Madirā ( wine?) should be erected. It follows from the above discussion that long before Pāņini there had arisen professional men who made their livelihood by attending on images and that temples of deities must have existed even in the 4th or 5th century B.C. 

The question whether the worship of images and the erec tion of temples spontaneously arose among the Vedio Aryans

Devayajña-Origin of image worship

or whether they derived the idea from some other race or sectarians has been very often discussed. There are three principal views, viz. (1) that the worship of images was derived from sūdras and Dravidian tribes and absorbed in the brahma nical cult; (2) that the making of images was copied from the Buddhists; (3) that this practice was a natural and spontaneous growth. The second view is not very plausible. Images of Buddha were not made for a long time after his nirvāņa. He was only represented at first by symbols. If modern chrono logy about Buddha's ministry is to be followed *(he was born about 563 B. C. and died about 483 B, C.), it is almost impossible to hold that images of gods originally came to be made in imitation of images or statues of Buddha, since, as we saw above, temples and images of gods had already become widespread throughout India in the 4th or 5th century B. C. 1888 The first view is supported with arguments of some weight by Dr. Farquhar in J. R. A. 8. for 1928 pp. 15-23. Vide also Dr. Charpentier in Indian Antiquary for 1927 pp. 89 ff. and 130 ff. But I do not hold that the reasons for this view are con vincing. There is no apparent reason why only about 400 B. C. image worship should have been copied from the gūdras by the brahmanas. The südra though given an inferior status had be come a part of Indian Society at least a thousand years before 400 B. C., as the Puruşasūkta shows. He had been serving the brābmapas for centuries before that date and brahmanas could in the times of the sutras partake of food cooked by him and could take sūdra women in marriage. So, if the worship of images was 8 practice borrowed from the sūdras, it should have prevailed at least a thousand years before 400 B. C. The fact that the devalaka brāhmana (one who maintained himself by attending on images either for & salary or by appropriating what was placed before the image) was not to be invited at & śrāddba and had thus an inferior status (Manu III. 152) is to be explained in a different way. The institution of worshippers of images had not an hoary antiquity behind it in the time of 

1697. See 'History of Buddbist thought' by Dr. E. J. Thomas (1933) for these dates. 

1698. Vide Mr. 0. C. Ganguly's paper the antiquity of the Buddha Image' in Ostasiatische Zeitschrift Noue Folge XIV, Heft 2/3, where he adduces very weighty grounds for holding that the beginning of the cult of the worship of the image of Buddba lies somewhere between 150 B. C. to 50 B. C.

Manu, as that of priests officiating at the srauta or gphy & sacrifices had in his day; besides such men must have nego looted the principal duty of a brāhmana (viz. study of the Veda ) and so they were looked down upon. Even in the times of the Brābmaņas the simple gphys sacrifices were being raised to the level of śrauta rites, which were gradually becoming less and less frequent. The Ait. Br. (11, 8) prescribes that when a man takes up an offering to a deity and is about to say 'yaşat' he should contemplate upon that deity for whom the offering is meant. This would naturally lead the worshipper to invest the deity with anthropomorphic attributes. The Nirukta devotes some space ( VII. 6-7 ) to the consideration of the question of the form of the deities referred to in the Vedio mantras. 1700 Three views are propounded, viz. (1) they have an anthropomorphic form, (2) they have no anthromorphic form, (3) they may par take of both characters, i. e. the deities though really non anthropomorphio may assume various forms for carrying out some purpose or activity. This last view contains the doctrine of avatāras. When Vedio saorifices became less and less preva lent owing to various causes (particularly because of the doctrine of ahimsā, the various upāsanās and the philosophy of the Absolute set forth in the Upadişads ), there arose the cult of the worship of images. Originally, it was not so universal or elaborate as it became in medieval and modern times. 

The literature on the subject of image-worship is vast. The principal topics are: the substances from which images are made, the principal deities of which images were or are worshipped, the proportions of the various limbs in manufactur ing images, the consecration of images and temples, the ritual of image worship. The subject of consecration of images and temples will be dealt with later on under the topio of Pratiştha. 

In the Bșhat-samhita of Varāhamihira (chap. 58, where images of Rāma, of Vişnu with eight or four or two arms, of Baladeva, Ekānamsā, Samba, Brahmā, Skanda, Siva, Girija as half of Siva's body, Buddha, Jina, the Sun, the Mātrs, Yama, Varuna, Kubers are described); in the Matsyapurāņa chap.

The word devapūja * 170% ocours in the Vārtika on Panini I.3. 25. The digests try to show that, just as yāga ( sacrifice ) consists in giving up materials accompanied by a mantra with reference to a deity that is then principally in view, so pājā also is yāga, as therein also there is giving up (or dedication ) of materials to a deity. 1903 

The next question is, who are entitled to perform devapūjā. Men and women of all varnas and even the untouchables were to worship Vişņu who incarnated himself as man-lion, accord ing to the Nțsimhapurāņa and Vfddba-Hārsta 1704 ( VI. 6 and 256 ). All the male members of a joint undivided family are to perform separately samdhyā, brahmayajña and agnihotra (if they have consecrated the greuta and grhya fires) but devapūja and vaisvadeva will be only one for the whole family, 1905 The time for devapūjā is after tarpaņa at noon and before vaisva deva; but some place it after vaišvadeva. According to Dakşa II. 30-31 all devakārya ( duties and ceremonies in honour of gods ) must be performed in the first half of the day. 

One of the peculiar tenets of Hinduism is adhikāra-bheda ( difference in rights, duties, ceremonies and worship dependent on difference in intellectual, emotional and spiritual equipment). Not every one was capable of the same discipline and regimen. Image worship was not absolutely necessary for everybody and the ancient writers never thought that when they worshipped an image they were simply paying homage to a material object. They believed that they contemplated the One Supreme Spirit in the form of the image or symbol before them, which helped ordi nary people to concentrate their mind on the Godhead to the exclusion of other external and engrossing objects and pursuits.

Devayajna-Image worship 

115 

According 1706 to Narada, the Bhagavata-purana XL.27.9 and Vrddha-Harita (VI. 128-129) Hari is to be worshipped in water, in fire, in the heart, in the sun, on the altar, in brahmanas and in images. Sātātapa 1907 says 'the gods of ordinary men are in water, those of the knowing are in heaven, of the ignorant and of those of small intelligence are in wood and clay (i. e. images) and of the yogin in his own self (or heart ). God is worshipped in fire by throwing oblations, in water by throwing flowers, in the heart by contemplation and in the orb of the sun by japa. 

The materials out of which images are to be made are precious stones, gold, silver, copper, brass, iron, stone, wood or clay. One made of precious stones was the best and the most inferior was that made of clay. The Bhāgavata-purāņa (XI 27.12) says that images are eight-fold viz, made of stone, wood. iron, sandal-wood or similar paste, drawn (as a picture), made of sand, of precious stones and lastly mental 1708 The Matsya purana (258. 20-21) adds lead and bronze' to the above eight of the Skanda. Vide also Vrddha-Harita VIII. 120. Among stones the Salagrāma stone (a black stone containing fossil ammonite found in the Gandaki river near a village called Salagrama ) and the stone from Dyārakā marked with a cakra (disous)are highly prized in the worship of Visnu. Vrddha-Harita (VIII. 183-189) highly extols Salagrāma-puja. It is stated by Vğddha-Harita that only dvijas can worship Sālagrama and not śūdras. According to several purāņa passages quoted in the Pujaprakasa (pp. 20-21) even women and sudras can perform

the worship of Salagrāma 19, but they should not touob it. Similarly they are not to worship lingas established in the past by sages &c. This worship of Salagrāma is comparatively ancient. Samkarācārya in his commentary on the Vedāntasūtra speaks in several places of Sālagrāma 1710 being worshipped as a symbol of Hari. Five kinds of stones were used in worship, viz. Bāņa-lingas from Narmada in Sive worship, Sālagrāma in Vişnu worship, metallic stone in Durgā worship, crystal for sun-worship and red stone in Gaņešs worship. The Rājatarangiņi ( II. 131 and VII. 185) refers to the establishment of Bāņalingas"?ll of Siva in Kashmir taken from the Narmada. About the images to be worshipped in the house it is stated in the Matsyapurāņa ( 258, 22 ) that they should be in size as big as a part of the thumb up to 12 angulas and not more ; but an image to be established in a temple should be up to sixteen angulas and not more or its proper height should be arrived at as follows: divide the height of the door into eight parts; taking seven parts divide them into one-third and two-thirds; the pedestal of the image should be one-third and the image should be two-thirds of the seven parts (i. e. f of seven-eighths of the height of the door).

In medieval and modern times Vişnu has been deemed to have descended to earth ten times to preserve the world and its culture. A brief account of the development of this theory will not be out of place here. The ten well-known avatāras are Matsya (fish), Kūrma (tortoise ), Varāha (boar), Narasimha (man-lion), Vāmana (dwarf), Parasurama, Rāma, Kțşņa, Buddha and Kalkin. There are faint glimmerings of the theory of avstāras and of these forms even in the earliest Vedic Literature. In Rg. VIII. 17. 131713 it is said that Indra was the grandson of the sage Srāgavrsa. This may be interpreted as meaning that Indra was supposed to have descended on the earth in & human form. In Rg. IV, 26. 1 the sage Vāmadeva exclaims1914 'I was Manu and I was also the Sun'. This is referred to in the Br. Up. I. 4. 10 and is often relied upon in support of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. It may be capable of that interpretation, but if that is not accepted it will at least tend to support the proposition that the Vedic sage thought that the

Sun could be born on the earth as a human being (i. e. there was an avatāra of the Sun). There is another sense in which this passage of the Rg and that of the Br. Up. are understood in the Vedāntasūtra 1. 1. 30 viz. that Vāmadeva had realized that bis soul was non-different from the Supreme Soul, Brahma. The elements of the avatars of Matsya ere probably suggested by the story of Manu who was saved from & flood by a great horned fish to whose horn Manu tied the rope of his ship when the flood rose. Vide Sat. Br. I. 8. 1. 1-6 (8. B. E, vol. 12, pp. 216-218 ).1716 

The tortoise avatāra was probably suggested by the legend that Prajāpati having assumed the form of a tortoise created living beings and that as the words Icūrma (tortoise) and katyapa mean the same object all creatures are said to be descended from (or to belong to ) Kasyapa (Sat. Br. VII. 5. 1. 5, S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 390 )."716 The peculiar exploit of the Boar incarnation, viz, raising up the earth from the bottom of the ocean, is alluded to in the Sat. Br. XIV. 1. 2. 11 (S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 451 ) boar called Emūşa raised the earth up and be was her lord Prajāpati. "1717 In the Rg. Vişnu is said to have pierced Varāba (1. 61. 7) and that he being incited by Indra brings to the worshipper a hundred buffaloes, rice cooked in milk, and the boar ( called ) Emūsa ( VIII. 77. 10). The Tai, Ār. X 1 refers to this myth. In the Kathaka S. VIII. 2 Prajāpati is said to have become a boar and plunged in water. Vide also Tai. S. VII. 1. 5. 1 and Tai. Br, I. 1. 3. Some elements of the story of the destruction of Hirapyakasipu by Vişnu in the man-lion form are supplied by the story of the slaughter of the demon Namuci by Indrs at dawn with the foam of waters, since Indra had agreed with Namuoi that he would not slay him by day or by night, with the dry or moist

or with the palm or with the fist, or with staff or bow &o.' (Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 1-4, S. B. E. vol. 44, pp. 222-223). Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 4 quotes Rg. VIII. 14. 13 which narrates that Indra cut off the head of Namuoi with the foam of waters.i718 In the ancient Tamil work Silappadikāram (translated by Prof. V. R. Diksitar ) there is a reference to the Narasimha avatūra. The special achievement of the dwarf incarnation, viz, the request of the dwarf for as much space as would be covered by his three steps, has its counter-part in the Rgveda, where the principal exploits of Vişņu are the taking of three steps and making the earth steady or fast. 1719 Vide Sat. Br, I. 2.5.1 for the Dwarf incarnation. In the Chandogya Up. III. 17. 6 it is stated that the sage Ghora Angirasa imparted & certain instruction to Krşņa, the son of Devak1,1720 This may have supplied some part of the legends about Krşņa in the Great Epio and the Purānas. 

We saw above that according to Patañjali Vasudeva was not a mere ksatriya but an incarnation of God. Patañjali quotes & quarter of a verse which speaks of Kamga being killed by Vāsudeva and refers to painted shows wherein the party of Vasudeva were dressed in blaok and of Kaṁsa in red (vide Mahābhāşya, vol. II. p. 36 and p. 119). Patañjali also speaks of Ugrasena as a member of the Andhaka clan and Vişvaksong as & Vrspi and of Baladeva also ( Mahābhāsya, vol. II. p. 257 on Pāṇini IV. 1. 114 ) and of Satyabhāmā (vol. I. p. 111 ) and Akrūra (vol. II. p. 295 ). So the main story of Krspa and persons connected with his ministry on earth as gathered from the Mahābhārata, the Harivaṁsa &c. were known to Patañjali and to some extent also to Pāņini. The Besnagara Inscription of Heliodorus ( E. I. vol. X, Appendix p. 63 No. 669 ) shows that even Greeks became devotees of Visnu. The Eran Stone

Inscription ( vide Gupta Inscriptions p. 158 No. 36 ) refers to the Boar Incarnation. The Bhagavatapurina II. 4. 18 deolares that even Kirātas, Hūņas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pukkasas, Abbfras, Suhmas, Yavanas, Khasas and others and even sinners, when they throw themselves on the meroy of Vişnu as devotees, are purified. It may therefore be assumed that the theory of the avataras of Vispu ( whether ten or less or more ) had been prevalent some centuries before the Christian era. 

In the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa it is frequently stated that God comes down to earth often for punishing the wioked, for the protection of the good and the establish ment of dharma. 1381 In the Santiparva (339. 103-104) the avatāras are stated to be ten and they are the same 88 now accepted except that Hamsa is mentioned instead of Buddha and Krsna is called Sātvata. Among the Purāṇas also several do not mention Buddha as an avatāra. The Mārkandeya ( 47, 7 ) speaks of Matsya, Kūrma and Varāha incarnations and in 4. 53-56 begins with Varāha and mentiona Nřsimha, Vamana and Mathura (1. e. Krşņa ). The Matsya ( 47. 39-45 ) speaks of 12 avatāras, some of which are different from the usual ones and verse 106 states that Bhřgu cursed Vişnu to be born as a human being seven times, as he killed a woman, viz. his wife. The Matsya-purāņa ( chap. 285. 6-7) mentions the well-known ten avatāras inoluding Buddha and this passage is quoted by Apararka on p. 338. The Matsya-purāņa 47. 247 speaks of Buddha as the 9th (avatāra). The Nșsimha-purana chap. 36. the Agni-purāna chap. 2 to 16 and the Vārāha-purāna 4. enumerate the well-known ten avatāras. The Vrddha-Harita smrti!738 (X. 145-146 ) enumerates ten avatāras, includes Hayagriva in them (in place of Buddha) and expressly says that Buddha should not be worshipped. In the Rāmāyaṇa (Ayodhyām

kāņda 109. 34) Buddha is reviled as a thief and an atheist. 1723 This passage may be an interpolation. In the Bhagavatapurapa there are three different lists of avatāras at I. 3 ( where 22 avatāras occur in which Buddha, Kalkin, Vyāsa, Balarama and Krspa are separately enumerated), II. 7 (where besides the well-known avatāras, Kapila, Dattatreya and others are mentioned ), and at VI. 8 Buddha and Kalkin are both mentioned in verse 17. 1724 The Krtyaratnākara (pp. 159-160) quotes & passage from the Brahmapurāns about a vrata on the 7th of the bright half of Vaišākha where it is stated that Vişnu as Buddha started the Sākyadharma and that on the 7th day of Vaišākba when the moon is in conjunction with the Puşya constellation, the image of Buddha should be bathed to the accompaniment of sayings of the Sākys and gifts of garments should be made to Sākya ascetics. The same work (pp. 247-248) quotes & passage of the Varahapurāņa on the observances of Buddha-dvadasi, when & golden image of Buddha was to be worshipped and given to a brāhmaṇa. In memoir No. 26 of the Archæological Survey of India, it is stated (p. 5) that in an inscription from South India of about the 7th century A. D. ooours a verse in a mutilated forin in which Buddha is enume rated among the ten avatāras (... narasimhotha Vāmanah Rāmo Rāmaśoa Krsnasca Buddhaḥ Kalki ca te daśa ). 1725 From the above discussion it follows that Buddha became in popular view an avatars of Vişnu for the Hindus froin about the 7th century A. D. Even about that time he was not universally so treated and orthodox writers like Kumārila ( who flourished somewhere about 650 to 750 A. D.) did not admit that he was an avatāra, In his Tantra vārtika (p. 195 on Jaimini I. 3. 4) Kumārilabhatta says that the Sakys texts were promulgated by Buddha and others that had strayed from the path of the three Vedas and

It has been said 'one should leave at a distance & person who does acts contrary to the other world. How can one who deceives himself confer benefit on another'". The Bșhatsamhita of Varahamihira (60. 19) states the persons who are to hold the office of worshipper in the temples of several deities, viz. the Bhagavatas for Vişnu, the Magas (sākadvipiya brāhmaṇas) in temples of the sun, dvijas smeared with ashes in Siva temples, those who know the group of mātrs in the temples of the Mother Goddesses, brāhmapas in the temples of Brahmā, Buddhists in the temples of Buddha who was good to all and whose mind was full of peace, naked ascetics in the temples of Jinas; who ever is a devotee of a particular god should worship that god according to the procedure prescribed in his own cult. 1727

723 

Kşemnendra ( about 1066 A. D.) in his Dasavatāra-carita and the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva (about 1180-1200 A. D.) speak of Buddha as an avatāra of Vişņu. Therefore at least before or about the 10th century A. D. Buddha had come to be looked upon as an avatāra of Visņu throughout India. 1728 The total disappearance of Buddhisin from India, the land of its birth, is a most striking phenomenon, which as stated by A. Schweitzer in 'Indian thought and its development' (tr. by Mrs. O. E. B. Russell, 1935) p. 137, cannot be satisfactorily explained. Though Buddha did not accept the authority of the Vedas and of brāhmaṇas, nor the existence of an individual soul nor the Supreme Soul, he believed in karma and punarjanma and in release from sainsāra by renunciation and desirelessness. Whon his followers deified Buddha, when animal sacrifices had been almost stopped and his insistence on universal charity and kindliness and on self-restraint were universally accepted by the followers of the Vedic religion, Buddha came to be deemed an avatāra of Vişnu, as the raison d'être for & separate cult ceased and the decadence of morals among monks and nuns hastened the downfall of Buddhism, the finishing touches being added by the Moslem invasions from about 1200 A. D. No one can affirm that persecution had anything to do with the disappearance of Buddhism from India. Though it cannot be said that there was no religious persecution whatever at any time in India, the evidence for persecution is very limited and such persecution if any as may have existed was as nothing compared to the perse oution of Christians by other Christians and of Jews in all con turies and particularly in the 20th century by several so-called Christian powers. The few well-authenticated cases of large-scale persecutions are those of Saśānka who persecuted the Buddhists (vide Beal's 'Records of the eastern world,' vol. I p. 212, vol. II. p. 42,91, 118, 121), of Mihirakula, of a Pāņdya king (in the 11th

century ) who persecuted the Jainas. From Asoka downwards, kings and the civil power always extended a generous tolerance to all sects (vide Asoka's Rock Edict No. 12). The father of the great emperor Harsa was a worshipper of the Sun, while Harşa's elder brother Rājyavardhana was a Buddhist and Harşa, though himself a Saiva, speaks of his brother with greater reverence than of his own father ( vide the Madhuban copperplate inscription in E. I. vol. VII p. 155 and I p. 67). Vide Barth's 'Religions of India' pp. 133-134, Farquhar's *Outlines of the Religious Literature of India' pp. 169, 175 for general religious tolerance in ancient India, 

Rāms and Krsna were worshipped as avatāras of Vişnu at least several centuries before Christ. Kalidasa in the Raghu varśa (XI. 22 ) and the Meghadūta indioates that he regarded Vamang as an avatāra of Vişņu as much as Rāma was. Simi. larly the Varāba and Narasimha Avatāras are frequently spoken of in the Kadambari, The Trimūrli i. e, the conception of the triune combination of Brahma, Vişnu and Siva into one God head is also an ancient one. The Mahābhārata (Vanaparva ) gives exptession to the idea that Prajāpati creates the world in the form of Brahma, sustains it in the form of the great Purusa and annihilates it in the form of Rudra. Hopkins in his 'Epic Mythology' p. 231 holds that this is & solitary passage about Trimurti and is & late one and that the Mahābhārata in general has no doctrine of Trimurti, but rather of the equality of Vişnu and Siva. Kalidasa in his Raghuvamsa (X. 16) and Kumārasambhava (II. 4.) 1728 breathes the same belief. The temples of Brahmā are now very few and far between, the most well-known being that at Puşkara (Ajmer). There is a temple of Brahmā in the Idar State and another at Sadhi in the Padra Taluka of the Baroda State. The Padmapurāņa (Srsti khanda 17 ) shows that the worship of Brahmā had declined at that time owing, it is said, to the curse of Savitri. 

Siva worship appears to be the most ancient worship that is still prevalent. Sir John Marshall's work on Mohenjo-daro (vol. I. pp. 52-53 and plate XII No. 17 ) shows a figure that is most probably of Siva as a great yogin surrounded by the

elephant, the tiger, the rhinoceros and the buffalo ( 88 Siva is called Pasupati). Vide also the Preface to vol. I. p. VII. At Mohenjo-daro the humped and short-horned bull is among the most prominent objects. Sive as half male and half female was worshipped long before Kālidāsa (vide first verse of the Malavi. kāgnimitra and Kumārasambhava VII. 28). Śive is often spoken of as Panoatunda ( with five faces), the five aspects being respectively called Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tat. puruşa and Isana ( vide Tai. Ār. X. 43-47, Vişnudharmottara III. 48.1). Though in later times the followers of Siva and Vişņu abused each other, the Mahabhārata and some of the Purānas exhibit & most tolerant spirit and say there is no difference between the two. 1730 Vide Vanaparva 39. 76 and 189. 5-6, śānti 343. 132, Matsyapurāņa 52, 23. The 1000 names of Vişnu are enumerated in Anušāsanaparva 149. 14-120 and the 

1000 names of Siva in Anušāsana 17 and Santi 285, 74 ff. 

About the images of the sun the Matsyapurāņa ( 11.31 and 33 ) enjoins that in painting pictures of the sun or in temples of the sun the feet of the sun are not to be drawn 1781 or shown. 

About Gaņeśa a few words have already been said (at pp. 213-216 ). Gañesa came to be worshipped even by the Jainas. Vide Acara-dinakara (composed in saivat 1468) published in the Kharataragaooha-granthamālā (part II, 1923), where on p. 210 there is the procedure of conseorating an image of Ganess even for Jainas and Journal of Indian History', vol. 18 for 1939 p. 158 for different types of Ganesa figures one of which has 18 arms. For a figure of Ganesa with sweetmeats (of about 500 A. D.) vide 'Ancient India ' by Codrington (Plate XXXIX). The Acāradinakar& says that images of Ganesa may have two, four, six, nine, 18 or 108 arms. The Agnipurāna chap. 71, the Mudgalapurāpa and Ganesapurāns deal with Ganess worship, but their dates are uncertain. The Vāraba. purīna chap. 23 narrates a fantastio story of the birth of Ganesa. The Gapapatyatharvaširşa ( Anan, ed.) identifies Ganesa with supreme Brahma.* The worship of the images of planets is

comparatively ancient. Yāj. I. 296-298 prescribes that the images for the worship of the nine grahas ( planets ) vize the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rābu and Ketu ( the last two are the nodal points ) should be made respectively of copper, crystal, red sandal-wood, gold (for both Mercury and Jupiter), silver, iron, lead and bronze. Yāj. then prescribes the details of the worship of the planets such as the clothes to be gifted, the flowers, incenses, offer ings, and the mantras ( from the Vāj. .), the fuel-sticks, the food, and the fee. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 297 quotes nine verses from the Matsyapurāna, chap. 94, concerning the details of the images of the nine planets. 

About Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, so early a writer AS Dandin (not later than 600 A. D.) says that she was 

darvasukla'(all white ). 

Another deity whose worship is very popular in the Deccan is Dattātreye. His worship cannot have originated later than the first centuries of the Christian era. In the Jābālopanişad, he is referred to as a paramahamsa and there is an Upanişad named after him, Vanaparva 115, Anuśāsana 153, śānti 49.36, say that he conferred boons on Kārtavīrya. Mārkapdeyapurāņa ( chap. 16-19) gives the story of his birth, calls him a yogin and asserts that he was offered wine and meat by his devotees (19.10.12). The Bhāgavata IX, 23, 23, Matsya 47. 242-246 and other puraņas also refer to him. In the Siśupālavadba of Māgba he is spoken of as an avatāra. 

The Vişnudharmasūtra 178 chap. 65 contains one of the earliest detailed description of devapūjā (of Vasudeva or Vişnu). “After having well bathed and washed his hands and feet and performed ācamana (sipping of water) he should worsbip Lord Vasudeva who is without beginning or end, before an idol or on the sacrificial ground. Having given animated form in his mind to Vispu with the mantra 'may the Asvins who possess life give thee life' (Maitrāyani Sam.

X. 9. 1-3), he must announce the arghya (water respectfully offered for washing the hands ); with the four mantras 'hiranyavarnāb'(Tai. 8. V.6.1.1-2) the pūdya (water for washing the feet); with 'may the waters of the plain pro pitiate us' (Atharva I. 6.4), the '&camaniya' (the water for Bipping ); with Rg. I. 23.22 the water meant for the bath ( should be offered); with 'in chariots, in axles, in the strength of bulls' (Tai. Br. II. 7.7) unguents and ornaments ; with (Rg. III. 8.4 'yuvā suvāsāḥ ) a garment; with 'endowed with flowers' (Tai, S. IV. 2.6.1) & flower; with thou art & slayer, slay the enemies' (Vāj. S.

After having thus worshipped Him, he must mutter the Puruşasūkta. After that he who desires to obtain eternal bliss should make oblations of clarified butter, while reciting the verses of the same hymn (Rg. X. 90)." The Baud. gs, pariseşasūtra II. 14 describes!738 the daily worship of Mahāpuruşa (i, e. Vişnu ). "A man after bathing should cowdung & pure and even spot and draw the image of Vişnu, should offer whole grains of rice and flowers to it in worship and then should invoke Vişnu to come by offer. ing water with flowers accompanied by the three vyābộtis repeated separately and together: then he should utter the words 'this kūrca (bundle) of darbhas is made for the divine lord, its blades are twisted by threes, it is green and gold, accept this'.

are substituted and some of the mantras are different. A fow differences will be found in the text quoted below. It is stated therein that when the worship is of a linga immovably fixed then there is no inyooation to come and no bidding of good-bye. 1786 

In the Pūjāprakāsa (pp. 97-149 ) and other digests the methods of devapūjā according to Saunaka, Grhyapariţişta, Rgvidhana, Visnudharmottarapurana, Bhagavatapurana, the Narasimhapurāņa are set out in detail. But for want of space they are all passed over. It will have been noticed from the passages of the Vişņu Dh. S, and of Baudhayana cited above that devapūją contains certain items and stages in the whole procedure. These are called upacāras (ways of service). They are usually stated to be sixteen. They are: avahana, asana, padya, arghya, acamaniya, snana, vastra, yajiopavita, anu. lepana or gandha, puspa, dhupa, dipa, naivedya (or upa bāra ), namaskāra, pradaksing and visarjana or udvāsana. In different works, the items differ. Some add bhusana (orna ment) after yajõopakita and tāmbāla (or mukhavāsa ) after pradaksina or naivedya (Vrddha-Harite VI. 31-32 and Puja prakasa, p. 98 ). Therefore some speak of 18 upacāras, 1986 Some omit avahana, add svagata (welcome) atter asana, madhuparka after doamaniya, and some have stotra (hymn of praise) and pranama (bow) as distinot upacāras, while others hold that these latter two are one and that pradakşiņa is part of visarjana (vide Pujaprakasa p. 98). If a person cannot afford to offer vastra (garment) and alamkara (ornament), he could

perform only ten out of these 16 upacaras viz. from pādya to naivedya; if he cannot afford to offer even ten he may offer only five pažcopacāra-pūja ) viz. from gandha to naivedya; if he has nothing he may perform with flowers alone all the 16 upacāras. When the image is immovably fixed on & pedestal there is no avāhana and visarjana and so the items become 14 or one may offer in their place only a handful of flowers with mantras." Those who can repeat the Purugasakta (Rg. X. 90) should repeat one of its verges before offering each of the 16 upacaras (see Nřsimhapuršņ& 62, 9-13). Those who cannot repeat that hymn and women and sūdras should simply say * Sivāya namaḥ' or 'Vişnave namah' ( adoration to Siva or Vişnu). Všddha-Hārlta (XI. 81 ) specially recommends the worship of the child Krsna to women and of Hari to widows (XI. 208 ). 1788 After each of snana, vastra, yajñopavíta and naivedya, doamana is to be offered as part of that upacara "*** (vide Nřsimhapurana 62. 14). The names of some of these upacāras ocour even in the Asv. gp. ( IV.7.10 and IV. 8.1) in relation to the brāhmaṇas invited at šrāddha such as āgana, arghya, gandha, malya (flowers), dhüpa, dipa and ācchādana (i.e. Vastra ). Farquhar is not right when he says in his 'Outlines of the Religious literature of India. p. 51 that the sixteen upacāras "are so distinct in character from the sacrificial cult as to betray alien origin.' When image-worship became general items offered to invited brāhmaṇas were also offered to the image of gods. It was a case of extension and not of borrowing from an alien cult. 

A few words have to be said in connection with some of the 16 upacaras. 

As regards the water to be employed in deyapüjā and rites for the Manes, the Vişņu Dh. 8. (66. 1) prescribes that it should not have been brought the night before ( but it must be drawn

that day). The worshipper should not sit on an Asans made of bamboo or stone, or of unsaorificial wood or on the bare ground, or on a seat made of grass or green leaves, but should sit on a woollen blanket or silken garment or deer-skin (Pājāprakāśa, p. 95 ). When offering arghya, in the vessel containing the water to be used for that purpose all or as many as one oan afford out of the following eight articles are to be mixed up, viz. curds, whole grains of rice, ends of kusa grass, milk, dürvā grass, honey, barley grains and white mustard seeds ( Matsya purāna 267. 2 quoted in the Pūjāprakasa p. 34). It is further said that arghya is offered to the image of Vişņu by means of a conch in which water is mixed with sandalwood paste, flowers and whole grains of rice. In the water for ācamana are mixed cardamom, cloves, usira grass and kakkola or as many of them as possible. The snana ( bath) of images is effected with five materials called pañcāmsta (five ambrosial things ) viz. milk, ourds, clarified butter, honey and sugar. 1740 The image is to be bathed with these five in the order stated, so that sugar coming last removes all effects of oiliness. After these & bath with pure water follows. In the pañcāmộtasnāna the following Vedic verses are repeated in order ; 'āpyāyasve' (Rg. I. 91. 16), * dadhikrāvpo' (Rg. IV. 39. 6), 'guftam mimikşe' ( Rg. II. 3, 11 ), 'madhu vātā' (Rg. I. 90. 6), 'svāduḥ pavasya' (Rg. IX. 85.6). It will be noticed that each of these mantras is suggestive of the material with regard to which it is uttered. No bath with water or these things is allowed when only a picture or a clay image is to be worshipped. If one cannot afford these, one may bathe the image with water in whioh the leaves of the basil plant (tulasi) are mixed up, as that plant is deemed to be the favourite of Vişnu. The water used in the bath of the image of a God is regarded as very sacred and it is used for acamana by the worshipper and members of his family and friends and is called tirtha ( it is also sprinkled over one's head ). 1741 As regards the unguents to be offered ( anulepana or gandha ) numerous rules are laid down

The Pūjāprakāģa ( pp. 42-49) waxes eloquent over the merit of offering basil leaves to Vişnu and using the same wood in worship generally and also when no flowers are available. The Vişnu Dh. S.1748 ( 66.5-9 ) prescribes that flowers emitting an overpowering smell or having no spell whatever are not to be used, nor flowers of thorny plants unless the flowers are white and sweetly fragrant ; that even red flowers such as saffron flowers and those that spring in ponds or lakes may be employed. There are grades in the merit derived from 

offering certain flowers, e. g. the Sm. C. I, pp. 201-202 and the Pūjāprakāsa p. 51 quote many verses of the Narasimhapurāņa, some of which arrange vanamallikā, cempaka, asoka, vābanti, malatı, kunda &o, in an Ascending order among flowers and the jāti flower is said to be the best of the flowers in the worship of Vişnu. The same work (p. 56 ) Dames dürvā and twentyfive flowers as favourites with Vişņu. Vide Vrddha-Harita VII. 53-59 for the flowers that may be used in Visņu-pūjā and Viddha Gautama p. 563. The flowers offered on a day are removed the next day by the worshipper wben he is about to offer worship that day. Such flowers are called ' nirmalya'and great virtue is attached to placing such flowers on one's head by way of homage to the deity worshipped ( vide Pājāprakāsa, pp. 27 and 90). The Sm, O. ( I. p. 204 ) quotes & purāna to the effect 'He, whose heart contemplates the form of Vişpu, on whose lips there is ever the name of Vişnu, who partakes of the naivedya offered to Vişņu and who places on his bead the water in which the feet of an image of Višņu are washed and the nirmālya of Vişnu, never falls off (from heaven).' The Madana. parijata (p. 303 ) quotes passages from the Vişnu-dharmottara about the flowers, that are not to be used in worship. In Siva worship the following flowers and leaves are in an agcending grade of worth; Viz, arka flowers, karavirs flowers, bilva leaves, flower of dropa, leaves of apamārga, flower of kuda, sami leaves,

blue lotus leaves, dhattara flower, saml flower, blue lotus, which is the best (vide Pajaprakasa, p. 210). The Madana parijata, p. 303 quotes from the Devipurana Verses which enumerate the flowers that are to be avoided in Siya worsbip. If no flowers are available, then a fruit may be offered or if no fruit is available then only leaves and lastly only white whole grains of rice or even water may be offered. 174 Lamps are to be fed with ghee or in its absence with sesame oil. 1748 Camphor is to be burnt before the image. There is a ceremony called ūrātrika (waving lights round the image ) performed with Beveral lights or pieces of camphor placed in a broad vessel which is held in both hands and waved round an image and over its head. Vide Pājāprakāśa, pp. 75 and 87. For naivedya no food is to be offered which is declared unfit in the gāstras for eating, nor the milk of a she-goat or she-buffalo though they are allowed for food, nor the meat of the five-nailed animals nor the flesh of the wild boar nor fish. The general rule is stated by the Rāmāyaṇa as whatever food a man eats the same is the food to be offered to his deities '. 1748 The Sm. C. (I. p. 203 ) quotes the Padmapurāņa to the effect that naivedya should be offered in a vessel of gold, silver, bronze, copper or of olay or in palāsa leaves or on lotus leaf. The naivedya is offered with the formula set out below, 1747 According to the Brahmapurāņa quoted by Aparārka, pp. 153-154 and Pājāprakasa (p. 82 ) the naivedya offered to Brahma, Visnu, Siva, the Sun, Devi, the Matya, to goblins and evil spirits respectively is to be given to brahma. pas, Satvatas ( Bhagavatas), those whose bodies are smeared with ashes, to Magas, to the Saktas, to women, to the poor.

One may also partake of the naivedya offered by oneself and the Smrtimuktāphala (Ehnika, p. 390) quotes Rg. L 154.5 in support. After naivedya, tambula is to be offered to the God worshipped. In the ancient grhya and dharma sutras no mention is made of tāmbūle or mukhavāsa (materials that will render the breath fragrant). Tāmbula was probably introduced some time before or about the beginning of the Christian era in South India and then spread northwards. Among the smrtis, Samvarta 55 quoted in the Kftyaratnakars p. 560, Laghu-Harita ( Anand. 39), Laghu-Ăśvalāyana ( Anand.) 1. 160-61 and 23. 105, Ausanasa (Jivānanda, part I. p. 509 ) refer to the chewing of tāmbüla after dinner. In the Raghuvamsa VI. 64 Kalidasa describes betelnut plants surrounded by betel creepers. The Kamasutra I 4.16 1748 states that a person after performing the brushing of the teeth, consulting a looking glass and partaking of tāmbūla for rendering his breath fragrant should set about his daily business. Vide also Kāmagūtra III. 4. 40, IV. 1. 36, V. 2. 21 and 24, VI. 1. 29, VI. 2.8 for other references. In the Bphat-samhitā of Varahamihira (77, 35-37 ) the virtues of tāmbüla and its ingredients are described. In the Kadambari ( para 85 ) the royal palace is compared to the house of a dealer in betel leaves ( tāmbulika) in which lavall, cloves, cardamom, kankola are stored. The Par. M. I. part 1. p. 434 quotes four verses from Vasiştha ( not found in the printed Dharmasūtra ) about the cutting off of the two ends of tāmbūla leaves before eating them. In the Vratakhanda ( of Caturvargacintamani, vol. II. part I, p. 242 ) Hemādri quotes Ratnakosa to the effect that tāmbūla means betel leaves, betel nut and chūnam; while * mukhavaga' means these together with cardamom, camphor, kakkola berries, places of copra and matulunga. The Nity.cara paddhati 1780 (p. 549 ) quotes verses showing that tāmbüla comprised nine ingredients viz. be tel nut, betel leaves, chunam, oamphor, cardamom, clove, kankola, copra, the matulunga fruit. In modern times pieces of almond, nutmeg fruit and bark thereof, saffron, cateohu are taken and matulunga is omitted. Thus the thirteen ingredients of tāmbüla are

made up. The Astangasamgrahas1 of Vāgbhata also mentions the several ingredients of tāmbūla including the essence of the bark of the Khadira tree (catechu ). In modern times tambala is said to be of 13 gunas, either because it contains thirteen ingredients or because it effects thirteen good results, the last of which are set out in a subhāşita quoted below. 

Pradaksing ( going round the image with the right hand always turned towards the image ) and namaskāra constitute only one upacāra ( item of worship) according to many. The namaskara to the image is either aştānga (with eight limbs ) or pañoānga ( with five limbs.) The first occurs when & person prostrates himself on the ground in front of the image in such a way that the palms of his hands, his feet, bis knees, his chest and forehead touch the ground and his mind, speech and eye are fixed on the image and the latter occurs when he prostrates himself with his hands, feet and head. 1752 There are other definitions of the aştānga namaskāra. These several parts of the worship of images have been judicially noticed in Ram brahma Chatterji v. Kedar Nath 36 Calcutta Law Journal 478 at *p. 483 (where the normal type of the continuous worship of an idol is described) and Pramatha Nath Mullick v. Pradyumna Kumar Mullick 52 Cal. 809 at p. 815 (P.O.). 

In modern times it is the practice to perform in homage to the sun twelve namaskāras or any multiple of twelve and repeat the following twelve names of the sun in the dative preceded by 'om' and followed by namaḥ': Mitra, Ravi, Sürya, Bhānu, Kbaga, Puşan, Hiranyagarbha, Marloi, Aditya, Savitr, Arka and Bhāskara. There is another method of these namaskaras oalled Tpcākalpanamaskāras in which after 'om' certain mystio syllables and their combinations in twos and

four together with certain mantras are repeated with the twelve names ( vide foot-note for illustrations ), 1758 

The Pūšāprakasa (pp. 166-188) mentions 3% aparadhas ( lapsos ) which should be avoided while engaged in worship or while one is about to perform Vişnupūja and the atonements for these. These 32 aparadhas (offences) against proper etiquette for worship are referred to in the Vardhapurana (130.5). 

A passage from Baudhāyana about Siva worship has already been quoted and it has been stated that worship of the phallio emblem of Siva appears to have been ourrent in the very ancient civilization brought to light by the finds dis covered at Mohenjo-daro. Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in his 'Val spavism and Saivism' has shown how Rudra is described as the supreme deity even in the Rg., how in the Tai. 8. IV.5. 1-11 there are eleven anuvākas (called Rudras) which contain a sublime eulogy of Rudra (and also in Vāj. 8. 16) and how numerous Saiva sects and dootrines arose in course of time (p. 119 f). Panini teaches the formation of Bhavāni, Saryani Rudrāņi and Mrdāni from the four names of Siva (IV. 1. 59). In the sacrifice called Salagava in the gļhya sūtras Rudra is worshipped as the supreme deity. The Āśv. gr. IV. 9.17 mentions twelve names of Rudra and adds 1754 (IV.9.27-29) that all names in the world, all armies, all exalted things belong to him. Patanjali in his Mahabhigya (vol. II. pp.387-388) on Pāņini V.2.76 speaks of a 'Siva-bhagavata'( a devotee of Siva). Vedantagütra IL 2. 37 is direoted, according to Samkara, to the refutation of the Pasupata seot of Saivas. In the Sāntiparva 284. 121-124 the Pasupatas are said to be opposed to the dharmas of varņa and Asrama The Kūrmapurāņa (pūrvārdha, chap. 16) speaks of the

sāstras of the Saiva sects, of Kāpālas, Nakulas 1786 (Lakulas?), Vāmas, Bhairavas, Pasupatas as meant for deluding the world. The Varābapurāņa (chap.70-71) is also directed against Pasupatan. The Pāśupata brāhmaṇas are stated in the Kādambari to have burrounded the minister Sukanāsę (para 90). Sive was worship ped in the form of the linga or as an image. It is believed that 14 crores of lingas were established by Bāņa, an Asura devotee of Siva, in various spots and these are called Bāņa-lingas (Nity.. cārapaddhati, p. 556 ) and the Bāņa-lingas (white stones) found in the Narmada, the Ganges and other holy rivers are only like them. In the Kādambari ( para 130 ) Bāņa speaks of sand lingas on the Acchoda lake and in another place of a linge made of pure mother-o'pearl. The Kürmapurāņa (pūrvārdha chap. 26 ) describes the origin of Linga and its worship and the Vāmana. purāna 46 lauds the several holy places where ancient lingas are established. The famous twelve Jyotir-lingas are; Omkara at Mandbāta, Mabākāla at Ujjayini(modern Ujjain), Tryambaka (near Nasik), Dbrspeśvara at Elora, Nāganatha ( towards the east of Ahmednagar), Bhima-Samkara (at the source of the Bhimā river in the Sahyadri ), Kedara-nātha in Garhwal, Vig. Veśvara at Benares, Somanātha in Kathiawar, Vaidyanatha new Parali. Mallikarjuna on the Srisaila, and Rāmeśvara in South India. Many of these are situated in central and western India near each other.

For a devotee of Siva, the wearing of a string of Rudraksa berries is necessary either on the band, the arm, the neck or on the head. 1787 The Smstimuktāphala (abnika p. 393 ) quotes verses from the Smrtiratna and the Ratnāvali about the merit secured hy bathing the linga with cow's milk, ourds, clarified butter, honey, sugarcane juice, pancagavya, water in which campbor and aguru are mixed up, and other substances. The 14th day of the dark half of a month has been sacred to Siva from ancient times. Bana in the Kadambari ( para 54 ) refers to the fact that queen VilasavatI went to worship Mahakāla at Ujjayini on the 14th. 

The worship of Durgā bas prevailed from ancient times, "68 She is worshipped under various names and aspects. In the Tai, Ar. X. 18 Siva is said to be the husband of Ambika or Umd. In the Kena Upanişad (III. 25 ) Umā Haimavati is mentioned as imparting to Indra the knowledge of the Great Being. The various names of Durgā are Umā, Pārvati, Devi, Ambikā, Gauri, Candi or Capdikā, Kali, Kumari, Lalita &o. The Mahabharata (Virāțaparva 6 and Bbişma 23 ) contains two hymns addressed to Durga in which she is stated to be Vindhyavāsinl and fond of blood and wine, and in Vanaparva 39, 4 it is stated that Umā became 8 kirāti when Siva became a kirāta to test the prowess of Arjuna. In the Kumārasambhava Kālidās& speaks of Pārvati, Umā, Aparna and derives the latter two words (I. 26 and V. 28). Yāj. I. 290 speaks of Ambikā as the mother of Vināyaka. The Deyi mābātmya in the Mārkandeyapurāpa (chap. 81-93 ) is the principal sacred text of Durgā worshippers in Northern India, E. I. vol. 9 p. 189 shows that about 625 A. D. Durgā wax lovoked as a supreme goddess. Bāņa in his Kadambari gives & graphio description of the temple of Candikā and refers to offer. ings of blood made to her (para 28 ), to her trident ( triøūla) and her slaughter of Mahişāsura. The Křtyaratnakara (p. 351) quotes verses from the Devipurāņa that the 8th of the bright half of a month is sacred to Davi ( and particularly of Aøvina ),

that a goat or a buffalo may be sacrificed for her.1789 These bloody rites are still continued in the Kali temple in Bengal and a few other shrines of Durgā. In Bengal the worship of Durgā in Asvina has been most popular. 1760 Raghunandana in his Durgārosna-paddhati gives an elaborate description of the worship of Durgā in Asvina. Durga is also worshipped as Sakti. The influence of Sakta worship has been great throughout India and will be briefly surveyed later on. 

In modern times devapāja differs considerably from the ritual of the ancient works of Vişnu and Baudhāyana ; it also differs from province to province and caste to caste. A brief analysis of the devapūjā practised by brāhmaṇas in Western India is given below: Acamana; prāņāyāms; adoration to Mahāganapati and certain other deities; twelve names of Ganesa, hyma of praise to Ganaś8, Gauri, Vişnu; mention of the place and the time with astronomical details about the day, the nakşatrs &o. ; then the sankalpa of performing devapůjā with sixteen upacaras ; contemplation on Ganapati with Rg. II. 23. 1 ( gapānām tvā); asanavidhi with an invocation to the earth ; nyasa (mystical sanctification of the body ) of the sixteen verses of Rg. X 90 on sixteen parts of the body; inyocation of the deities and the saored rivers in the water jar and offering sandalwood paste, flowers and whole grains of rice to the jar; then invocation of the conch and bell in a similar way; sprinkling of oneself and the materials of worsbip with water accompanied by the mantra ('apavitrah pavitro vā &c.'); dhyana (contemplation) of Vişnu, Siva, Ganesa, the sun's diso, Durgā holding a bunch of flowers in one's folded hands; then offering the sixteen upacaras enume. rated above to the accompaniment of the 16 verses of Rg. X. 90 to one's favourite deity ; final benediction, 1761 When several deities are worshipped, there are two methods in which the upacaras may be offered. One may offer the upacaras from Āvābapa to namaskāra to one deity or the principal deity and then the same upacaras to the other deity or deities one after

another. This method is oalled kandānusamaya. The other method occurs when āvābana is done for the several deities in order, then āgana for all, then pādya for all and so on up to namas kāra. This is called padārthānusamaya. This method is generally preferred. Vide the com. of Nārāyaṇa on Āśv. gr. I. 24. 7, the com. on Katyāyana-srauta 1. 5. 9-11 for detailed explanations of these. 

From the early centuries of the Christian era the works on Tantra exercised & profound influence on the ritual of devapājā and several mystical postures of the hands and fingers such as the mudrās and the nyāsas began to occupy the minds of the worshippers. 1762 The Bhāgavata-purāņa XI. 27. 7 says that devapūjā is of three kinds viz, Vaidiki, Tāntriki and misrā. The first and the third are for the three varnas and Tantrikt for kūdras.

VAISVADEVA Vaišvadeva.-offering of cooked food to all Gods ). 

Daksa ( II. 56 ) says that in the 5th part of the day a house holder has to allow distribution of food according to his ability to the gods, Manes, men and even insects. Vai vadeva is to be offered according to Sātātapa ( quoted by Medhātithi on Manu V, 7 and by Aparārka p. 142) in the gphya fire if one has preserved it, or in the ordinary fire. If no fire is available one may offer it even in water or on the bare ground. Laghu. Vyāga II. 52 says the same. 

Somo medieval works like the Smrtyarthagāra and the Par, M. (I. part 1, p. 389 ) state that vaišvadeva really com prises the three daily sacrifices viz. devayajña, bhūtayajña and pitsyajña. The rite is so called because in it sacrifice is offered to all the gods or because food is cooked therein for all the gods. 1763 But in the ancient gphyasūtras the three yajñas are kept distinct. In the Āśv. gr. III. 1 the five daily sacrifices are enumerated, but only one, the brahmayajña, is thereafter described in detail and we have to understand that Vaišvadeva bas already been dealt with under homa in Āśv, gr I. 2. 1-2 and that I. 2. 3-10 is concerned with bbūtayajña or baliharana, out of which the 7th sūtra contemplates an offering to Visve-devas and sūtra 10 an offering of cooked food to pitrs. The Sān. gr. II. 14 speaks of Vaišvadeva, wbile Gobhila gr. I. 4. 1-15, Khādira gr. I. 5. 22-35 speak of balibarapa only. Panini VI. 2. 39 teaches the accent of 'kşullaka-vaiśvadeva' (as & compound). Vaik. 1784 VI. 17 expressly says that devayajña is the home to the gods offered with cooked food meant for all the gods. According to Gautaina (V.9) the deities of vaišvadevo are Agoi, Dhanvantari, Viśve-devas, Prajāpati and Sviştakrt (Agni). According 1785 to Manu (III. 84-86) the deities are Agni,

R. p. 278 ) states that Vaišvadeva is to be offered to Vasudeva, Samkarşana, Aniruddha, Puruşa, Satya, Aoyuta, Agni, Soma, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Indrāgni, Visve-devas, Prajapati, Anumati, Dhanvantari, Vastospati, ( Agni) Sviştakýt. Vide Bhār, gļ. III. 12. Mānava gr. II. 12. 1-2, Kathaka gļ, 54, Vaik. III. 7 for other lists of deities in Vaišvadeva. It is on account of this divergence that digests like the Madanapārijata (p. 317) say that Vaišve deva is of two kinds, viz. what is common to all smrtis like that of Manu and secondly what is stated in one's own gphyasūtra. The Sm. O. (I. p. 212 )**** says the same. 

All ancient smrtis say that Vaišvadeva is to be performed twice, once in the morning and then in the evening. Vide Asy. gr. I. 2. 1, Vas. Dh. S, XI. 3, Manu III. 121, Visņu Dh. S. 59. 13, Gobhila II. 34. But in later times it came to be performed only once in the morning and the sankalpa includes both in one statement.1787 The verses justo damūna' ( Rs. V. 4. 5) and *ehyagna' (Rg. I. 76. 2) are used in invoking Agni, then the Verse catvāri sýnga' (Rg. IV, 58. 3) and several ordinary verses describing the characteristics of Agni are employed for the dhyana ( contemplation) of Agni. From the food cooked for one's meal, & portion is taken out in another vessel, and covered with clarified butter; it is then divided into three parts. Then one places one's left hand on one's beart and with the right hand takes up from one portion of the food morsels equal to a ripe myrobalan fruit, presses it with one's right thumb and offers it with the right band to Sürya, Prajāpati, Soma Vanaspati, Agni-soma, Indragni, Dyāvāprthivi, Dhanvantari, Indra, Viúve Devas, Brahmā. Then holy ashes are taken from the fire with the mantra ' mi nastoke' (Rg. I. 114. 8 ) and ashes are applied to the forehead, the throat, the navel, the right and left shoulders and the head with certain mantras and & concluding prayer is

Medieval digests like the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 103 ) discuss the question whether vaišvadeva is puruşārtha only (i.e. recommend ed to men for effecting some beneficent consequence to them) or whether it is puruşārtba as well as a rite for effeoting a samskāra ( unseen or spiritual result) of the food cooked. In the latter case food will be pradhāna ( the principal matter ) and vaišvadeva will be secondary; but in the former case ( i. e. if it were only puruşartha ) food will be secondary and Vaišva deva principal. Relying "788 on Aģv. gr. I. 2. 1 some say that Vaišvadeva is meant as a samskāra of food and relying on Āśv. gr. III. 1. 1 and 4 others say that it is puruşārtha. The Mit. declares that vaišvadeva is puruşārtha only, as Manu (II. 28 ) holds that the human body is rendered fit for spiritual know ledge by the daily yajñas and by other sacrifices and that if vaišvadeva is not puruşartha alone, each time food is cooked in the day (on account of the sudden advent of many guests ) vai vadeva would have to be performed several times in the day; but Manu III. 108 forbids & fresh vaiśvadeva in such a case. Sm. C. (I. p. 213 ) and Par, M. (1. 1. p. 390 ) bold the same view. The Smrtyarthasāra p. 46 and Laghu-Asvalāyana I. 116 hold the view that vai vadova is both for the samakāra of the householder and also of the food. 1790 

There was divergence of view on other questions viz. whether vaiśvadeva was to be performed before srāddha or after it and whether food for vaiśvadeva was to be separately cooked from that meant for śrāddba. Aparārka P. 462 sets out the conflicting views on the first question and says that for vaiśV8 deva there are three options, viz. it may be performed imme diately after food is ready, or it may be offered after baliharana or it may be performed after sraddha is finished.

pārijata p. 320 and Bphat-Parāsara p. 156 hold that vaišvadova must be performed before sraddha. Vide Smptimuktāpbala (abnika pp. 406-407) also; on the other hand Anušāsana-parva ( 97. 16-18 ) directs that on śrāddba day, pitr-tarpana comes first, then offering of bali, and then vaihvadeva. The Madanapārijāta p. 318 says that the food for the vaišvadeva must be separately cooked from what is meant for śrāddha. In the case of a joint family of father and sons or of several brothers, the father alone performs vaiśvadeva or the eldest brother ; but if the father or eldest brother is unable to do it himself, a son or younger brother may offer it at his bidding (Laghu-Asvalāyana I. 117-119 ). 

The food to be offered should be sprinkled over with ghee or with curds or milk but not with oil or salt. Ap. Dh. 8.1771 II. 6. 15. 12-14 prescribes that there is to be no homa of ksāra and lavara (vide note 723 above) and also of food that is mixed up with inferior food (like kulattha &c.); but if one is com pelled to offer inferior food in vaišvadeva ( owing to poverty &c. ) he should take some hot ashes from the grhys or ordinary fire towards the north of the fire and offer the food in the ashes. The Smstyarthasara We p. 47 states that cereals like gram and māşa beans are not to be used in vaišvadeva food. Even when & man was not going to eat on a particular day he had to offer vaidvadeva (Aparārka p. 145 ). If he could afford no food, he was to offer fruits, roots or even water. 1773 He who has no gpbya fire may offer vai vadeva food into the ordinary fire with only the vyāhịtis and the rest may be left for crows. 

Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 3. 1 and 4) says that vaišvadeva food should be cooked by dryas ( persons of the twice-born olasges ) that are purified (by bathing &c.), or sūdras supervised by aryas may cook the food.1774 Medieval writers remarked, as usual, that the latter rule about sūdras being cooks applied only to another age.1775 Ap.

that when the food is ready i.e. cooked, the cook should announce while standing, to the owner of the house it is ready and the owner should reply ' it (food) is auspiciously roady, it is food that gives supremacy; may it not be lost.' If no vaišvadeva is performed on any day, the householder had to fast the day and night (Gobhila-smrti III. 120). Daksa II. 62 and Yama condemn to hell him who takes his own meal without offering Vaidvadeva, when he is not himself in distress or difficulty. 1778 

It has been stated above (p.158) that the gūdra was to offer all the five yajñas without Vedic or Paurānio mantras, but only with the word 'namaḥ'and he was to use uncooked food for vai vedeva. Vide Yaj. I. 121 and the Mit, thereon and Ahnikaprakāśa, p. 401. 

Baliharana or Bhūtayajña :-Here also there is some diver gence between the ancient gshya-sūtras and medieval and modern practice. The Asv. gr. I. 2. 3-11 deals with this. The deities to whom bali (or part of the food taken out when per forming vai vadova) is offered are: to the same deities to whom the devayajna is offered as stated above, to the waters, to herbs and trees, to the house, to the domestio deities, to the deities of the ground (on which the house is built), to Indra and Indra's men, to Yama and Yama's men, to Varuna and Varuna's men, to Soma and Soma's men ( these are offered in the several quarters 1777 ), to Brahman and Brahman's men in the middle, to the Viśve-devas, to all day-walking beings, to the Rakşases towards the north ; svadha to the pitřs (Manes )-with these words he should pour out the remnant of the food to the south, while wearing the sacred thread suspended over the right shoulder. Ašv. adds that if baliharana is performed by night then the words to all night-walking beings' are used instead of 'to all day-walking beings'. 

Gobhila gr. I. 4. 5-15, Pār. gr. II. 9 and other grhya sūtras, Ap. Dh. S. IL. 2. 3. 15-II. 2. 4. 9, Gautama V. 10-15, differ con siderably from the above in several respects. But for want of space no reference can be made to these differences. 

In bhūtayajia, bali is to be 1778 offered not into fire but on the ground, which is to be wiped with the hand and sprinkled

with water, and then the bali is to be put down and water is poured on it thereafter. Vide Ap. Dh. 8. II. 2. 3. 15. The Āp. Dh. S. (II. 4. 9. 5-6 ) prescribes that one should make all including dogs and cāņdālas participators in the food cooked for vaišvadeva and adds the view of some (which he disapproves) that one should not give food to the un deserving.779 Manu III. 87-93 says that after performing vais vadeva one should offer balis in all directions to Indra, Yama, Varuna, Soms and their followers, a bali to Maruts on the door, to waters a bali in water, a bali to the trees in mortar and pestle, a bali to Srl on the top of the house, to Bhadrakāli at the foot of the house, to Brahmā and Vāstospati in the midst of the house ; a bali may be thrown up in the sky to Visve Devas, to the day-walking beings (when baliharans is done by day) and to night-walking beings ( by night); a bali should be offered to the prosperity of all on the first floor 1780 and all the remaining portion of the food for balis should be offered to the manes towards the south ; the householder sbould lightly ( 80 that no dust will get mixed with it) offer on the ground some food to dogs, to outcasts, to cāndalas, to those suffering from loathsome diseases (such as leprosy), to crows and insects. Yāj. I. 103 calls upon the householder to throw food to dogs, cāņdālas and crows on the ground."781 

These directions to give food even to outcasts, dogs and birds were the outcome of the noble sentiment of universal kindliness and charity, the idea that One Spirit pervades and illumines the meanest of creatures and binds all together. The Śān. gr. (II, 14 )1788 winds up its vaišvadeva section with this fine exhortation "let him throw food to dogs, to śvapacas (eaters

of dog-flesh), to birds on the ground 3; let him eat nothing with out having out off a portion (to be offered as a bali); let him not eat alone, nor before others ( relatives and guests ), since the mantra says 'the fool gets food in vain' (Rg. X. 117.6).' The Mahabharata (Vanaparva II. 59 ) says that offering food to dogs, svapacas and birds on the ground is known as vaivadeva, whioh is performed in the morning and evening. The same Verse occurs at Anusasanaparva 97.22-23. Aparārka p. 145 says that vaiśvadeva comprises all actions from the offering into fire oblations of food up to the throwing of food to dogs and the like in the morning and the evening. 

In modern times the way in which balis are offered and their number are set out in the diagram balow. The one drawn is for the morning baliharana. For the svening one the only change necessary would be to put 'agnaye svāha ' ( No. 1 ) in place of sūryāya svāhā' and 'naktam-cāribhyaḥ' for * divā. oaribhyah' in No. 27. The word 'svāha ' is not repeated in the diagram after each name'783 for the sake of space. Manu III. 121 prescribes that bali is offered in the evening by the wife but without mantras ( i. e. she is not to repeat the mantras) 'Indrāya svaha.' &c., but only to contemplate on the several deities,

Pitryajña :The word occurs in Rg. X. 16. 10, but its exact meaning is not certain. Pitryajña may be performed in either of three ways as stated above (on p. 700 ) viz. by tarpana ( Manu III. 70 and 283 ), or by performing baliharaṇa in which remnants of bali food are to be offered to the pitrs (Menu III. 91 and Asv. gp. I. 2. 11) or by performing sraddha daily with food on inviting at least one brahmaņa for dinner (Manu III. 82-83). Sraddhas will be dealt with later and the other two ( tarpaņa and baliharana ) have already been dealt with. In this daily śrāddha 1784 there is no offering of pindas ( balls of rice ) and the several strict rules and procedure of the pārvana śrāddha do not apply.

CHAPTER XXI NRYAJÑA OR MANUŞYA-YAJÑA. 

NȚyajña or Manusya-yajña : ( Honouring guests)-Manu (III. 70 ) states that this consists in honouring guests. In the oldest hymns of the Rgveda fire is described as a guest in the house of the sacrificer. In Rg. I. 73. 1 Agni is described as lying in a pleasant spot and pleased like a guest (syonasir atithir-na priņāno). Vide Rg. V, 1. 8 1785 and 9, V, 4. 5, VIL 42. 4 for fire being called atithi. In Rg. IV. 4. 10 it is said of Agni'you become the protector, the friend, of him wbo offers you hospitality in the usual (or proper) order,' Vide Rg. IV.33.7 and Tai. S. I. 2. 10.1 for the word ātithya. Athar Vaveda IX. 6 is an eulogy of hospitality in which the various stages in the reception and feeding of a guest are metaphori cally represented as the various actions performed in a sacri fice. 1988 The Tai. 8. V.2.2. 4 refers to the faot that when & guest comes, hospitality in which ghee abounds, is offered to him' and it remarks that 'one who comes in a chariot and one who comes in & cart are the two most honoured among guests. 1987: The Tai. S. (VI. 2. 1. 2) says 'hospitality is offered to all the followers accompanied by whom a king comes'. Vide Ait. Br. IL. 9 for almost the same words. The San. Br. IL 9 remarks 1788 when a man offers oblations at sunrise, he indeed offers hospitality to a great god who has started on a journey.' The Tai. Br. (II. 1. 3) shows that a guest was honoured by having & lit lamp placed before him and then food was served to him. 1989 The Ait. Br. ( 25. 5) says that a guest

should not be refused in the evening. 1790 The Sat. Br. (II. 1.4. 2. 8. B. E. vol. 12, p. 291) remarks that it would be unbecoming for a person to take food before men who are staying with him as guests have eaten'. The Satapatha shows that an ox or a goat was cooked for a guest, either a king or a brāhmaṇa (III. 4. 1.2). Vide also Ait. Br. 3. 4 for the offering of an ox or barren cow to a king or another deserving person coming as a guest. Yaj. I. 109 also says that a big ox or a goat was to be kept apart for a guest learned in the Veda. But the Mit. and other 1781 medieval writers to whom flesh-eating was an anathema and an unspeakable sin for a brāhmaṇa remark that an ox or a goat was to be understood as set apart for the guest to flatter him ( with the words this ox is yours') just as one says in humility all this house is yours' and that the ox or goat was not meant to be given in gift or to be killed sinoe it would be impossible to find an or each time & śrotriya guest oame. The Ait. Ār. I. 1. 1 remarks . whoever is good and has attained eminence is & (real) guest, people do not treat with hospitality one who is undeserving. "1702 In the Tai. Up. ( I. 11. 2 ) one of the exhortations of the teacher to the pupil returning home is 'atithi-devo bhava' (honour guests). The same Upanisad says elsewhere ( III 10.1) "let him never turn away a stranger from his house, that is the rule. Therefore a man should by all means acquire much food, for people say (to the guest ) * there is food ready for him.' If he gives food amply, food is given to him amply". In the Katbopanişad1783 ( I. 7-9 ) it is said 'a brāhmaṇa entering & bouse as a guest is (like) fire. People offer this (well-known) appeasement to him. Oh, son of Vivasvat, offer him water (to wash his feet). If a brahmana guest stays in a man's house without food, he cuts off (destroys) the hopes and expectations, (fruits of the friendship ( of the good), the rewards of sacrifices and charitable acts, song and cattle.' Then Yama offered to bestow three boons on Naoiketas As some penance for allowing Naciketas to remain without food

in his house for three days. The Nirukta 1794 IV.5 in explaining Rg. V. 4. 5 ( justo damūnā atithirduroņa ) derives the word *atithi' from the root 'at' to go and also from 'tithi'(day) and '&' meaning "comes' (from 'i' with 'abbi'). Vide Manu III. 102 for another derivation; also Parāśara I. 42 and Mārk, 29. 2-9. Manu and others say that an atithi is so called because he does not stay for a whole tithi ( i. e. day) and 'an atithi is a brābmaņa who stays for one night only as a guest.' 

The honouring of guests comes after the offering of bali and Baud. gr. II. 9. 1-2, Vas. XI. 6, Visnupurāna III. 11. 55 ordain that after baliharana the householder should wait in front of the yard of his house for as much time as would be required for milking & cow or for a longer time at his desire for receiving guests. Others make it a definite time viz, one eighth of & muhurta (vide Mark. purāņa 29. 24-25 quoted in Sm. C. I., p. 217). 1795 The Ap. Dh. S. contains a very elaborate treatment of honouring guests (II. 3. 6. 3 to II. 4, 9.6). Gaut. V. 36, Manu III. 102-108 and Yāj. I. 107 and 111 state that be is called an atithi who belonging to & different village and intending to stay one night only arrives in the evening, that one who has already been invited for dinner is not an atithi properly so called, that a person who belongs to the same village or who is a friend or fellow-student is not an atithi, that one has to honour guests according to one's ability, that guests are to be preferred according to the order of varnas and that among the brāhmaṇas, the srotriya and one who has com pletely mastered (at least one) recension of the Veda is to be preferred. Vas. Dh. S. XI. 6 says that the worthiest are to be honoured first. Gaut. V. 39-42 and Manu III. 110-112 say that a ksatriya is not really an atithi to & brābmapa nor are vaisyas nor sūdras; but they add that, 1796 if & kşatriya comes to a brāhmana's house as a guest (i. e, as a traveller who has no food with him and about the time of taking food) he should be treated to a meal after brābmaņa guests take their food and valdya and südra guests should be given food

by a brahmana householder along with his servants and thereby he should show his kindliness. Ap. Dh. 8. II. 4. 9.5 requires the householder to give food to all who come at the end of the Vaišvadeva, even including cāndalas, but it mentions the view of some that one need not give food to unworthy persons (vide note 1779 above). Commentators like Haradatta explain that. in the case of worthy guests, if the householder does not give food, though able, he incurs sin; but in the case of unworthy people he incurs no blemish by not giving, but if he gives to them also, he secures merit. Viddha-Gautama (pp. 535-536) calls upon.& householder to treat even a cāndala with consi deration. Parisara (I. 40 ) and Satataps went so far"707 as to say that even if a householder hates & visitor or the latter is & fool, the householder should give him food if he arrives at the time of meals. Sāntiparva 146. 5 says that even an enemy when he comes to one's house as a guest must be hospitably treated, as & tree does not remove its shade from one who approaches it to fell it. But Āp. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 19, Manu IV. 213, Yāj. I. 162 are opposed to this and state that a guest who is at enmity with the host shall not eat his food, nor shall he eat the food of a host who accuses him or suspects him of a orime. Vpddha-Harita (8. 239-240 ) states the humane rule 'if & traveller is a sūdra or belongs to a pratiloma caste (such as & cāņdāls) and comes to one's house tired and hungry, the householder should give bim food; but if a beretio or & patita (one outcast for grave sins) comes in that condition, one should not give him cooked food, but only grain. Compare Manu IV. 30. Viddha Gautama ( chap. 6, p. 535 and chap. 12, p. 590, Jivānanda part 2) says the same about a candāla or svapāka being given cooked food, Baud. gr. II. 9. 21 enjoins welcome to all travellers including capdālas. 

The guest is to be shown honour by going out to meet him by offering him water to wash his feet, by giving him a seat, by lighting a lamp before him, by giving food and lodging, by personal attendance on him, by offering him & bed and by accompanying him some distance when he departe. Vide Gaut. V. 29-34, 37, Ap. Dh. 8. II. 3. 6. 7-15, Manu III. 99, 107 and IV. 29, Daks8 III. 5-8. Vanaparva 200. 22-25 and Anudāsana 2 highly extol hospitality. Anušāsana 7. 6 says the host

should give his eye, mind and agreeable speech to the guest, he should personally attend on him and should accompany him when he (the guest ) departs; this sacrifice demands these five fees'. 1798 Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 4. 16-21) says that if a brāhmana that has not studied the Veda or & kşatriya or & vaišys comes as a guest to & brāhmana, the latter should offer him & seat, water and food, but need not rise to receive him, that if a šūdra comes as a guest to a brāhmana, the latter should ask him to do some work, then give him food, but if he has none, he should send his slaves to bring it from the royal palace (or store-house ). "790 Haradatta makes the interesting remark that for honouring sūdra visitors the king should set apart in each village some paddy or other corn. Gaut. V. 33, Manu III. 101 ( = Vanaparva II. 54 and Udyoga 36. 34), Ap. Dh, S. II. 2. 4. 13-14, Yāj. I. 107, Baud. gr. II. 9. 21-23 say that 1800 if a man has not the means to give food to all visitors he should at least offer them water, room and grass to lie down upon, and agreeable speech. If the householder is absent, his wife is to look after honouring guests. Gaut. (V. 37-38 ) says that guests of the brāhmana, ksatriya and vaiśya oastes should be respectively greeted with the words kušala, anāmaya and ārogya and the sūdra also with arogya. Vide Manu II. 127 also and note 831 above. 

The motive of this injunction to honour guests was olear, viz, universal kindliness, Other motives were added by smrtis in order to emphasize the observance of this duty. The San. gr. II. 17. 1 says "Even if a man constantly gathers grass (i. e. maintains himself by collecting the grains that fall in a field when the crop is taken away) and performs agnihotra, a brāh maņa guest who stays in his house without receiving the honour (due as a guest ) takes away the (merit) of all his good

works”. 180? Manu III. 100 says the same. Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6.6 says that by honouring guests one secures heaven and freedom from misfortune, 1808 Vide also Āp. Dh. 8. II. 3.7. 16. One verse quoted in numerous works like the Vişnu Dh. 8. 67, 33, śāntiparva 191. 12, Vişnupurāņa III. 9. 15, Mārkandeya 29. 31, Brahmapurāna 114. 36 is 'when a guest returns from the house of a person with his bope of getting food shattered, he (the guest) transfers his own sins to the householder and departs taking with him the householder's merit (punya)'. The Vayupurāņa (71.74) and Brhat-Parāśara (Jivānanda, part 2, p. 99) say that yogins and siddhas (those who have attained transcendant powers) wander over this earth in various forms for the benefit of men; therefore one should with folded hands welcome a guest. If one is not able to feed many guests, then Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 3. 15-18) declares that one should feed him who is endowed with superior qualities or who is the first to arrive or who is a śrotriya. 

Parasara (I. 46-47) says that the brahmacarin and the ascetio are the masters of food (i. e. their claim is the first); if one eats without giving to these one should perform the penance of cāndrāyaṇa. When a yati comes as a guest, one should give water in his hand, then food and then again water. The food becomes as big as Meru (mountain) and the water as the sea. Laghu-Vişņu (II. 12-14) highly eulogises a yogin as & guest and Daksa VII. 42-44 and Vțddha-Harita 8. 89 Bay that if a yati stays as a guest in a householder's house for & single night, the latter's accumulated sins are destroyed and when a yati takes food at & man's house it is Vişnu himself who is fed. 1803 

If after some guests have been fed another guest or a batch of guests arrives, then the householder should have food cooked

again, but in such a case no fresh vaiévadeva and baliharana are necessary. Vide Manu III. 105 and 108. It has been already shown from the Satapatha that the householder is not to partake of meals before the guests, but rather after the guests. The Āp. Dh. $. II. 3. 7, 3 states 1804 'he who eats before his guest. eats. ( destroys ) food, prosperity, progeny, cattle and merit of his own house'. Manu III. 114 ( = Vişņu Dh. S. 67. 39) allows the householder to feed newly married girls (his daughters or sisters ), unmarried girls, persons who are ill, and pregnant women even before guests ; while Gautama V. 23 says that these should be fed at the same time as the guests. Manu III. 113, 116-118, Vişņu Dh. S. 67. 38-43, Yāj. 1. 105, 108, Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 10,1805 Baud. Dh. 8. II. 3. 19 say that one should feed one's friends, relatives and one's servants and then the householder and his wife should dine, that one should not stint one's servants and slaves ( who are to be fed daily with food) in order to be able to feed guests, that he who eats before these ( guests, relatives, young women of the house, servants) will have his soul harassed by vultures after death, that be wbo cooks food for himself only swallows merely sin and that when he eats what remains after offering yajña to gode, beings, pitss and guests, he really eats. Manu III. 285 ( = Vanaparva II. 60) says that *vighasa is what is left after brāhmaṇas and guests have partaken and ampta is what is left after being offered in sacrifice and one should always eat these.' Baud. Dh. S. (II. 3. 68 and 21-22) says 1806 "all beings subsist on food, the Veda declares * food is life'; therefore food should be given, as food is the highest offering. One should not take food without giving it to others" and quotes two verses said to have been sung by food itself. It is on account of these sentiments that are ingrained even to-day in the minds of all Hindus that no Poor Law and no work-houses were required in India. This senti ment undoubtedly leads to abuses, but what system is not

without abuses? The Poor Law and work-houges have their own abuses and the general tax-payer has probably to pay more for relief to the poor, the destitute and unemployed in England than under the Indian system of feeding the poor voluntarily. 

Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 4. 9. 2-4) sayg1807 that when the guest departs, the host should accompany him to the place where his conveyance is drawn up and if he has no conveyance, then till the guest gives him leave to go or if the guest forgets to give leave, the host should turn back from the boundary. Vas. Dh. 8. XI. 15 and Yāj. I. 113 speak also of accompanying the guest till the boundary, and Aparārka explains that the boundary may be that of the host's house site, or of his field or of the village according to the eminepce of the guest. Sankha Likhita 808 prescribe that the host should accompany the guest till he reaches & public garden or public hall, & prapā (place where water is distributed gratis ), a tank, a temple, a sacred (or big) tree (like the fig tree) or ā river and then should go round the guest and say the words 'farewell till we see each other again.' It is in accordance with this that in the fourth Act of the Sakuntala Kanva's pupil reminds his teacher that one should accompany one's dear relative up to some reservoir of water.

BHOJANA 

Bhojana ( taking one's meals ) :-Dakşs (II. 56 and 68) states that in the fifth 1809 part of the day the householder should make according to his capacity the gods, pitrs, mon and even lower animals (lit. insects) participators (in food) and after doing that, he should himself partake of the remainder of the food cooked. Thus he was to take his mealy during one hour and a half after noon. Bhojana is one of the most important subjects treated of in Dharmaśāstra works and the greatest importance (next to rules about marriage) attaches to the numerous injunotions and taboos about food. The principal subjects to be dealt with under this head are: how many times food was to be taken; the kinds of foods and drinks allowed or forbidden; what causes food defilement; flesh-eating and drink ing wine; whose food was to be eaten; etiquette and ceremonies before taking food, at the time of taking it and after taking it. 

Great importance was attached to purity of food from very ancient times. In the Chandogya Up. (VII. 26.2) occurs this Passage 'when there is purity of food, then the mind becomes pure, when the mind is pure then follows firm remembrance (of the real Self), when the last is secured all knots (that bind the soul to the world) are loosened."1810 

The several matters about bhojana found in the Vedic literature will be first briefly set out. From Rg. VI. 30.3 it appears that food was taken, while sitting ('the mountains sank

down just as men sit down to take food'). "A person was to take food 18.11 only twice a day' says the Tai. Br. I. 4. 9. and the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2. 6. There were certain taboos about articles of food even in the earliest texts. Tai. S. II. 5.1.1 states that all red exudations (resins) of trees or the juice that oozes out from trees when they are cut ( with an exe &c.) should not be eaten, since that colour is due to the (sharing of ) brābmana. murder. Similarly the milk of the cow was not to be drunk for ten days after delivery (Tai. Br. II. 1.1, III.1.3). The Ait. Br. 6.9 states that one should not eat the food of a dikşita (one initiated for a Vedic sacrifice) till the performance of vapāhoma by him. Rg. I. 187 (vv. 1-7) is a hymn in praise of food. The story of Uşasti Cākrāyana in the Chāndogya Up, shows that in a dire calamity when no food can be had, one may eat anything, even the remnants of another's food and the Vedāntasutra (III. 4. 28-31, sarvannānumatis.ca prāņātyaye tad-darsanāt) is based on this episode in the Chandogya. In the Ait. Ar. V, 3. 3 1812 it is stated that one who knows this (i, e. the Malāvrata ) should not recite these texts before one who knows it not nor dine with him nor should be take delight in his company.' The sages are said in the Kausitaki Br. (12.3) to have told Kavaşa who sat in their midst that they would not eat with him as he was the son of a dāsi. The question about flesh-eating and drinking spirituous liquors will be dealt with in detail later. 

Manu V. 4 declared that death overtakes brāhmaṇas on account of four causes, viz. absence of Vedic study, giving up the performance of proper duties and actions, laziness and blemishes attaching to the food taken. The Gp. R. . 347 quotes verses to the effect 'food is the filth of men, everything is centred in food, the evil deeds of men resort to their food. Who over eats the food of another partakes of that man's sin.' There fore elaborate regulations are laid down about everything relating to food. Ap. Dh. S, I. 11, 31. 1, Vas. Dh. S. XII. 18. Vişnu Dh. S. 68. 40, Manu II. 5 say that one should face the east when taking food and the Vişnu Dh. 8. 68. 41 and Ap. Dh.

8. II. 8. 19. 1-2 allow a man to face the south, except when the diner's mother is alive. Manu II. 52 ( = Anuśāsanaparva 104, 57) states 'one facing the east eats food whioh tends to long life, one facing the south eats food which leads to fame, one facing the west eats ( so as to produce ) wealth and one facing north partakes of truth.' This means that one who eats facing any one of these directions secures the benefit specified. The Vāmanapurāna and Vişnupurāna quoted in Gr. R. p. 312 disallow the south and west. One must take one's meals in private in a place screened from public view. The Sm. C. quotes1813 verses of Devala, Uśanas and the Padmapurāpa to the effect 'one should take food in privacy, for one who does so is endowed with wealth and one who eats his meals in public becomes bereft of wealth; one should not eat in the sight of many (who are themselves not eating) and many men should not eat before a single person who is only looking at them'. One may 1814 eat in the company of one's sons, younger brothers, dependents &c. Some writers went so far as 1815 to recoinmend that 'one should take one's food alone and not in the company of even one's relatives or other brābmanas, since who can know the secret sins a person in whose company one eats is guilty of'? The conception underlying this unchari table view was stated by Bphaspati to be that 'when several persons sit down to dinner in a continuous row, the sins one of them is guilty of attach to the others in the same row'. Even in modern times many persons in Northern India follow this view and it is & well-known proverb that nine bhayyas have ten hearths. The place where one takes one's food should be freshly cowdunged and pure. Ap. Dh. S. (1.5. 17. 6-8) says that one should not take one's food in & boat nor on & wooden platform, but may do so on a pure floor. One was not to eat while seated on an elephant, or horse or camel

or in some conveyance, or in a cemetery or in a temple or on a bed or chair; nor should one eat food placed on one's palm ( Brahmapurāņa quoted in Gr. R. p. 325 ). One should wasb one's hands and feet before sitting down to take one's meal. Manu IV. 76 says ( Anugāgana 104. 61-62 and Atri in Jivānanda, part 1, p. 9) that one should begin one's dinner while one's feet are wet, since that leads on to long life. Vyasa quoted in Sm. C. ( I. p. 221 ) prescribes that one should have five limbs wet at the time of taking food, viz. the hands, the feet and the mouth, 1816 All writers prescribe that one should observe silence or at least restraint of speech at the time of meals ( e. g. vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 2, Lagbu-Hārsta 40). Vrddha-Manu quoted by the Sm. C. I. p. 223 817 requires complete silence till five morsels are taken and restraint in speech thereafter. Following the Vedic injunotions quoted above, Gaut, IX. 59, Baud. Dh. S. II, 7. 36, Manu II. 56, Sam varta 12 and others say that a householder should take only two meals every day, should not eat food in the intervening period and that if he acts up to this advice he reaps the merit of a fast. Gobhila-smrti (II. 33) says the same and adds 1818 that the evening meal may be taken till one prahara and a half (i. e. 44 hours ) after nightfall. One was not to eat very early in the morning nor at midnight nor at twilight ( Manu IV. 55 and 62 and Visņu Dh. 8. 68. 48). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 8. 19. 10 ) allows partaking of roots and fruits between two meals. Below the vessel or plate or leaf from which one eats, one has to draw & figure with water or holy ashes. According to the Brahmapurāņa ( quoted in Gr. R. p. 311 ) the mandalas ( figures ) for brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and südras should respectively be in the form of a square, a triangle, a circle and a crescent; while according to Sankba ( in Sm. C. I., D. 221), Laghu-Satātapa 133, Atri (Jivādanda chap. V. 1, p. 7) in the case of the sūdra water is to

be sprinkled on the ground below his plate. The reasons for drawing a mandala are stated by these authorities to be that the Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Brahma and other gods partake of only that food which is offered after a mandala is made and that evil spirits and goblins carry away the flavour of the food when no mandala is made. The person taking his food should sit on a low wooden stool having four feet or on a seat made of wool or of the skin of a goat ( which latter is said to be the best by Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 19. 1). One should not sit on a seat of cowdung cakes (dried), or of clay, or of the leaves of aśvattha or palāsa or arka plant or a seat made by joining two planks together or on a shattered one or partly burnt one or on one made fast with iron (nails). Vide Smrtyarthagāra p. 69. The vessel or plate from which one is to eat is to be placed on the mandala drawn on the ground. The vessel from which to eat may be of gold, silver, copper, lotus or palasa leaves (vide Veda-Vyāsa III. 67-68, Paighinasi quoted in Āhnika-prakāga p. 467). A copper vessel is forbidden to house holders who should use bell-metal (kāmsya) vessel. Ap. Dh. 9. (II. 8. 19. 3) says that & copper plate with gold in the centre 1819 is recommended. But a bronze plate for eating from, tāmbūla and a luxurious bath with oil &c., were not allowed to an ascetic, a brahmacārin and & widow. 1810 Harita (quoted by Sm. O. I. p. 222) stated that one was not to eat in an iron or earthern vessel, but Āp. Dh. S. (I. 5. 17. 9-12)1881 presoribes that an earthen vessel not used for cooking may be used as a plate for meals, but if it had been used for cooking food, then it may be used as a plate for food after being baked in fire, that an iron plate scoured with ashes is pure and even & wooden plate may be used provided it is thoroughly soraped from inside. Manu IV. 65 states that one should not eat from a broken vessel, but Paithinasi remarks that there is nothing wrong in eating from & broken plate made of copper, silver, gold, oonoh-shell, or stone.1822 Some smstis forbade lotus or palāsa leaves, but the

Vṛddha Harita 8. 250-256 presoribes that the plate may be of gold, silver or bronze or any leaf allowed by sastras, that leaves of palass and lotus are not to be used by householders but may be used by ascetics, forest hermits and in śrāddhas and sets out leaves forbidden and allowed. Even now in modern times people prefer (particularly in oaste dinners and marriages) plan tain leaves for dining or silver vessels for honoured guests and brāhmaṇas at śrāddha or use plates prepared from stitched leaves of various trees. Before sitting down to take one's food, one has to perform acamana (twice ) outside the place where one is to eat and has to perform āoamana after taking his meals. This practice was most ancient, as it is attested by the Chandogya Up. V. 2. 2 1828 and the Br. Up. VI. 1. 14. The rulo is laid down by Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 5. 16. 9,1884 Manu II. 53, V. 138 and others also. Vide Devala (quoted in the Smrtimukt&phala, Āhnika, p. 418) for ūcamana outside the room for meals. When sitting down to eat a person must wear his saored thread in the upavita form (Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1) and must also have an upper garment,1885 but should not cover his head (Manu IV. 45 III. 238, Ap. Dk. S. II. 2. 4. 22-23 and II. 8. 19. 12). A darvi (ladle or spoon) is to be employed in serving ghee, oil, cooked food, all condiments, salt (i. e. these should not be served by the bare hand) but pot in giving water or uncooked food (vide Sm. O. I. p. 223 quoting several smstis). The householder may wear in his band gold or jewel (ring &c.) at the time of meals. Gaut. IX. 59, Vas. Dh. S. III. 69, Manu II. 5 -55 say that wben food is brought to be served, the person about to eat it should greet it, should pay honour to it, show his delight at it and should not find fault with it. Vas.

Baya " he should honour food in the morning and evening by saying 'I like it', by saying 'it was good for eating' in the case of food served in srāddhas and it was perfect' as to food offered in abhyudayika rites 1834 (i. e. in marriage &c.). Kullūka (on Manu II. 54) and the Gr. R. (p. 314) quote verses of the Adipurina (Brahmapurāna in Gr. R.) to the effect that on seeing food one should fold one's hands and should bow to it saying' may this always be ours' and that God Vişņu himself said that whoever honours food honours him. After the food is served on the plate or dish, the water should sprinkle water round it and say 'I sprinkle thee that art satya ( truth ) with sta (right order)' (in the morn ing) and 'I sprinkle thee that art pta with satya' (in the evening ).1887 According to some he then offers to the right of the plate or dish on the ground a little of the food in his plate from the west towards the east to Dharmarāja ( i.e. Yama), Citragupta and pretas ( vide Bhavisyapurāņa quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 224 and Abnikaprakāśa P. 465 ), 1828 Others say that these balis are offered to bhūpati, bhuvanapati and bhūtānām pati, while in modern times they are offered to Citra, Citragupta, Yama, Yamadūta (and some add a fifth 'garvebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ svāhā). He should then sip & little water with the words 'thou art the seat of ambrosia (amrtopastara pam-asi) and at the end of the meal the words used are 'thou art the cover of ambrosia' (amstāpidhānam-asi). All this has been prescribed from very ancient times and has continued to this day. Yāj. I. 106 calls this sipping of water apošana (tak. ing in of water) and its purpose is to make food beneficial like ampta (nectar ) and to cover it as if with & garment. He then offers five morsels on which ghee is sprinkled to the five modes

of prāna preceded by the word "om' and 1889 followed by 

svāhā'. These five prānāhutis are mentioned in the Chāndogya Up. V. 19-23, where prānas are enumerated in the order prāņa, vyāpa, apāna, samāna and udāns. The Vedāntasūtra III. 3. 40-41 explains that the Chandogya passage applies only when one sits down to dinner and not when one goes without it. Medieval digests quoting Bphat-Parāśara added a sixth offering to Brahman after the prānāhutis and this is done in modern times. While the āhutis to prāņa are being offered complete silence ( absence of all sound including even 'hum') is to be observed. Baud. Dh. S. (II. 7. 6) insists on complete silence throughout the meal and if one speaks, one has to mutter the words 'Om bhūr bhuvah svar-om' and then eat further on. Others allow speech after prānāhutis for refusing food or condi ments or for dharma. Vide Sm. M., ābnika p. 423 which quotes Sāndilya that 'silence is not necessary at meals for householders and one should show one's solicitude for those who dine with one by talking to them.' Saunaka quoted by Sm. C. I., p. 223, Věddha-Hārita 8. 263-265 dilate upon the different fingers of the hand that are to be employed in taking the five abutis to the life breaths while the Bhojana-sutra says that according to Baudhāyana all abutis were to be offered with all the fingers. Hārlta quoted in the Sm. C. I. p. 226 states that mārjana, offering bali, worship and eating should be done with the tips of fingers. The plate or vessel is to be throughout kept on the ground at a śrāddha dinner and the thumb and the next two fingers of the left hand may be used for holding the plate or plantain leaf in position, but if the house is full of people and it is likely that dust may be raised by their feet or by their clothes, then a person taking his meal may raise up his plate from the ground with his left hand after he has taken five morsels.1830 The diner is not to allow any sound of eating to escape, he is to put

each morsel in bis mouth with all the fingers including the thumb, 1881 he is not to wave bis hand. Various rules are laid down in the Vişņupurāņa ( III. 11. 83-84) and Brahmapurāņa ( quoted in Gr. R. p. 224) as to the order in which various articles are to be eaten, viz. first sweet liquid food may be taken, then salted and sour, and then pungent and bitter, the last item should be milk and after that one should not take ourds ; & householder should always take food mixed with ghee. One is not to cut off portions of food or cakes, roots, bulbs, fruits or flesh with the teeth and then eat them ( Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 10). Some smộtis prescribe that while taking each morsel one should say 1832 . Govinda'. At the time of eating, several postures are forbidden, viz. one should not stretch one's feet or place then on another seat ( & footstool &o.) nor should one have one's haunches and knees tied by a garment (Vişnu Dh. S. 68. 40) nor should one place one's hand on one's left foot, nor should one wear one's shoes or wooden sandals, nor should one come in contact with leather( vide Smrtimuktāphala, ābnika p. 425 ). Baud. Dh. S. (1. 1. 21 ) states that among usages peculiar to the south were those of eating in the company of one whose upanayana had not been performed or of one's wife or taking stalo food. But Baud. disapproved of these, Manu IV. 43, Vişnu Dh. S. 68. 46 and Vas. Dh. S. XIJ. 31 1883 say that one should not eat together with one's wife and Vas. Dh. 8. adds the reason that by so doing the child born has no strength as stated in the Sat. Br. X. 5. 2.9. Kullüka and some other commentators on Manu IV. 43 hold that the prohibition relates to eating in the same dish with one's wife, while, as Medhātithi states, others hold that it applies also to eating with one's wife at the same time and place. The Sm. C. (I. p. 227) and other digesta quote a amšti verso which allows a brahmana to eat in the same dish with his brāhmaṇa wife and explain the verse as applying to a brāhmaṇa who is on a journey. The

Smrtyarthasāra (p. 69 ) says that one can eat in the same dish with one's wife at the time of marriage. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 131 says the same. 

Various rules are laid down as to how much one is to eat. Two famous verses quoted by Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13, Vas. Dh. S. VI. 20–21 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 31-32 are 'an ascetic should wat eight morsels, 188* & forest hermit 16, a householder 32 and \# Vedic student an unlimited number. One who has conge crated the Vedio fires, a draught ox and a brahmavarin are able to perform their work by eating, they cannot perform work when they do not eat!,1885 Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 12 expressly directs that a householder should not stint himself as to food, so that he may be able to properly perform his work. Haradatta explains that the general rule laid down by Ap. Db. S. itself ( II. 1. 1. %) that one should take only two meals a day does not apply to one who has consecrated the Vedio fires. Baud, Dh. S. II. 7. 33-34 goes further 1836 and says that if a house holder (who is āhitāgni ) and a Vedio student practise austeri ties by observing a fast they are guilty of sin, because they thereby cause cessation of agnihotra to the life-breaths. But there is no sin if & fast is observed by these as & penance for some lapse. Sabars on Jaimini V.1. 20 (p. 1301 ) appears to favour the idea that an āhitāgni may eat several 889 times a day. 

One was to occupy the first seat in a row at a dinner only if specially requested to do so, but when thus seated on the first seat, one should not begin to eat food before others, but after them (Saikha quoted by Aparārka p. 150). While several brābmaņas are taking their meal in & oontinuous row, if one of them takes ācamana 1838 before the others, or gives the

remains of his food to the pupil or gets up, the others should leave eating the food in their disbes and also get up and the brahmana who thus prematurely gets up is called a brahmahā (a murderer of a brāhmaṇa or brahmakantaka ). These rules are quoted in the Sm, C. (I. p. 227), Gr. R. p. 331, Smştimuktā. phala (ahnika p. 427). In order to avoid this awkward position Various devices were employed. A pankli (row of diners ) ceased to be a continuous line if two diners were separated from each other by fire, by ashes, by a pillar, & passage, or a door or by the ground being of a lower level. Aparārka (p. 476 ) quotes Brhaspati that even if persons are seated in one row, but they are separated from each other by (streaks of ) asbes and they do not touch each other, then there is no intermingling ( i. e, persons of different castes also may sit in a row being separated by a streak of ashes &c.). Ap. Dh. S. 1.5. 17. 2 days that one should not sit down to dinner in the same row with undeserving persons (by reason of birth, character or learning ). 

At p. 100 above it has been stated how brāhmaṇas following several oocupations that were deemed low were not invited at śrāddhas. Gaut. 1888* XV, 28-29, Baud, Dh. S. II. 8. 2, Ap. Db. S.

dūsakas). A panktipāvana is one who knows the six angas of the Veda (vide note 775 above), who has studied the Jyeşthasā. man, who has kindled the Nāciketa fire, who knows the three madhu verses, who has studied the texts called Trisuparpa, who maintains the five fires (vide p.679 above), who has taken the cere monial bath after finishing vedic studies, who knows the Mantras and the Brāhmana of his Veda, who has studied dharmaśāstra and who is the son of a woman married in the brāhma form, Ap. Dh. S. adds 'one who has performed the four medhas' ( Ašvamedha, Sarvamedha, Puruşamedha and Pitsmedha, according to Haradatta). Manu says that one who understands the mean ing of the Veda, one who expounds the Veda, a brahmacārin, one who is a liberal donor (lit, one who gives & thousand cows), one who has reached the age of one hundred are all pankti. pāvanas, Sankh& states that one who is devoted to Yoga, ona who regards gold and a clod of earth as equal, an ascetio given to contemplation are all panktipāvanas. Anuśāsana 90. 34 and Vāyu 83. 52-55 include those who study the bhāsyas, those who are devoted to grammar, those who study the purānas among pankti-pāvanas. Among those who defile company are one suffering from leprosy, a bald man, one who is guilty of adultery, who is the son of a brāhmaṇa following the profes sion of arms (Ap. Db. S. II. 7. 17. 21); those who engage in acts not fit for brahmanas, those who are cunning, those who have deficient or excessive limbs, those who have abandoned Veda, the sacred fires and their parents or gurus, those who subsist on food given by sūdras (Sankba XIV. 2-4). Vide Apararka pp. 453-455 for quotations on those who defile company. 

When there was a row of diners, all were to be served the same food and no difference was to be made between one man and another and if a difference were made & penance was prescribed as if he had committed brāhmana murder. 1838 If while dining one brahmana touches another, he should give up eating or after finish ing bis meal he should mutter the Gāyatri verse 108 times (as penance). In modern times generally the eyes are touched with water if this happens. If a diner touched & server who had & vessel containing food, the server should place the vessel con

taining food on the ground, should perform acamana, the food in the vessel should have water sprinkled over it and then it may be served. One was not to eat or drink with the left hand. One should drink water at the time of meals with a drinking bowl or vessel, one should never drink water with the two hands joined together ( Yaj. I. 138 ), but when not eating food one may drink water with the bare right hand. After finishing one's meal one is to repeat the Apošana 'amptāpidh. nam-asi' and drink some water, wash one's hands, sip water twice and may lightly brush his teeth for removing particles of food, then sip water again and take timbūla. 1840 Aāvalāyana ( in verge ) recommends 16 mouthfuls of water ( gandûşa ) for cleansing the mouth after dinner (Abn. Pr. p. 483 ). An ascetic, a Vedio student and a widow were not to partake of tāmbūla. 

A person was not to eat everything in his plate; he should leave some remnant 1841 of food except of curds, honey, ghee, milk and saktu ( barley or barley flour). What remains was to be given to one's wife, servant or slave (Par. M. I. part 1, p. 422). No one was to give the remnants of one's food to another nor to eat the remnants of another's food, except a obild that might eat the remnants of the food of its parents and guru (vide Smţtimuktāphala, āhnika p. 431 ). Remnants of food were not to be given to a südrs unless he was one's dependent (Manu IV, 80, Āp. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 25-26). Atri (quoted in Sm. O. I. p. 228 ) says that even on sipping water after dinner one remains impure till one's plate is removed, till the ground where the food was taken is cow-dunged, till after leaving his seat he moves on the ground elsewhere. Vide also Ap. Dh. S. II. 2 4. 24. The plate of & brāhmaṇa may be removed by a brāhmaṇa (but not by anyone else ) and the plates of the brahmanas invited at a śrāddha repast were to be removed by the person who per formed the grāddha or by his son or pupil, but not by one whose upanayana is not performed nor by the wife nor by any one else (Laghu-Ašvalāyana I. 165-166 ).

Most of the above rules may more or less be exemplified from the descriptions of the procedure of eating set out in Baud. Dh. $. II. 7, from the Bbojanasūtra of Katyāyana for the followers of the white Yajurveda, from Hārita quoted in the Gr. R. Pp. 316-17 among the ancient writers and froin the Smstya. rthasāra pp. 68-69 among the authors of digests. It is impossi ble to get out any of them here for want of space, but an extract from the last work is given in the Appendix. 1848 

There were certain rules about abstaining from food in the case of eclipses of the sun and the moon. They are set out in the Sm. C. I. pp. 228-229, the Sairtyarthasāra (p. 69), Matsya purāņa chap. 67, Aparārka pp. 151, 427-430. During the period of eclipse one was not to eat anything. Not only go but for 4 praharas ( i. e. 12 hours) and 3 pruharas ( i. e. 9 hours) before the actual eclipse of the sun and the moon respectively all are to avoid taking food, except children, very old men and persons who are ill. This rule was observed up till very recent times by most people. When the eclipse begins one was to bathe and give gifts, perform tarpans or śrāddba. Then one was to bathe after 1848 the eolipse was over and take food. If the sun sets while still eclipsed, one should bathe the next day on seeing the sun and then take food. If the moon rose eclipsed, one was not to eat anything during the day next to that on which the moon rises eclipsed. That these rules are ancient follows from the fact that some of them occur even in the Vişņu Dh. S. An eclipse of the sun is desoribed even in the Rg.V.40.5-9 and it was supposed to be brought about by an asura. The Asura Svarbhānu is goid to bave pierced the sun with darkness in the Kāthaka 8. XI. 3 and the Tai. S. IL 1. 2. 2; the San. Br. 24.3 and Tandya Br. ( IV. 5. 2, IV. 6. 13 ) speak of an eclipse. In the Atharva veda 19. 9. 10 the Sun and Rabu are brought together. The Obandogya Up. VIII. 13. 1 states that the knowing self shakes off bis body when going to the world of Brahma like a horse shedding his bair or like the moon released from the mouth of Rahu. 

Visņu Dh. 8. ( 68. 4-5 ) prescribes that a man was not to eat when a cow or a brahmana met with an aqcident or when the king was in distress ( or dead).

The most elaborate rules are laid down about what food should or should not be eaten and from whom food may or may not be taken. These rules occur in most of the smộtis. It would be impossible to do justice to all of them. The following smrtis deal with this matter at lengtb. Gaut. 17, Ap. Db. S. I. 5. 16. 17-I. 6. 19; Vas. Dh. S. 14, Manu VI. 207-223, Yāj. I. 167-181. The Santiperva chapters 36 and 78, the Kūrmapurāņa ( uttarardha chap. 17 ), Padma (ādikhanda chap. 56), and several other purinas deal with this topic. Among the digests the Sm. C.

An attempt will be made to present the rules in an orderly manner 

Aparārka p. 241 quotes a passage from the Bhavişya purāņa 184 which states the various reasons for food being forbidden viz. jāliduşta or svabhāvaduşta (i. A. forbidden on account of its very nature ) such as garlio, leek, onion &o.; kriyādusta (forbidden on account of certain actions done with reference to it) such as cooked food served with the bare hand or seen by a patita (outcast), cāndālas, dogs &o., or because one in a row takes ācamana or rises before others ; kāladusta (forbidden because of the time that has elapsed or because of the inappropriateness of the time ) such as stale food or food eaten in eclipses or the milk of a cow before ten days have elapsed from delivery; samsargaduşta (spoilt by foul contact) such as what comes in contact with a dog or wine or garlic, or hair or inseots &o.; sahtllekha (what causes disgust to the mind) such as füoes &c. To those may be added rasadusta (what has lost its flavour) such as payasa or kşira on the same day; pangrahaduşta ( what is forbidden simply because it belongs to & partloular individual such as patita ). Aparārka (p. 1157) says that condemned food, partaking of which is an upapataka (a minor sin), is of six kinds, viz. due to svabhāva, kala, samparka (same as samsargs ), kriya, bhāva, and parigraba. 1848 An example of bhāvaduşta given by Aparārka is sugarcane

juice which a man may feel to be forbidden to him because he believes it to be wine. According to Gaut. 17. 12 bhāvadusta means food offered with disrespect or which the eater comes to hate or becomes disgusted with. Haradatta on Gaut. 23. 23 mentions five of these varieties (of Aparārka p. 1157) except bbāvaduşta. 1846 

Before proceeding further some remarks must be made about flesh-eating. In the Rg. frequent reference is made to the cooking of the flesh of the or for offering to gods (partioular ly Indra). For example, in Rg. X. 86. 14 Indra is made to say. They cook for me 15 plus twenty oxen'; vide Rg. X. 27. 2. In Rg. X. 91. 14 it is stated that for Agni were sacrificed horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows and rams. In Rg. VIII. 43. 11 1847 Agni is styled 'one whose food is the ox and the barren cow.' In Rg. X. 79. 6 it is suggested that the cow was cut up with a sword or axe. In the Rg. itself the cow is frequently called .aghnya '(vide Rg. I. 164. 27 and 40, IV. 1. 6, V. 83. 8, VIII. 69. 21, X. 87. 16 &c.). The word 'agbaya' appears to mean 'one that does not deserve to be killed' and the Nirukta (XI. 43 )1848 explains it in that way. It should be noted that that word occurs sometimes in apposition to dhenu' ( as in Rg. IV, 1.6, VIII. 69, 2). So it may be argued that in the times of the Rg. only barren cows if at all were killed for sacrifice or moat and Oows yielding milk were held to be not fit for being killed. It is only in this way that one can explain the high praise bestowed on the cow in Rg. VI. 28. 1-8 and in Rg. VIII. 101. 15 and 16 where the cow is described to be the mother of Rudras, the daughter of Vasus, the sister of Adityas and the centre of nectar' and the sage winds up by praying to the knowing man 'do not kill the cow, that is innocent and is Aditi herself. "1849 In Rg. VIII. 101. 16. the cow is called 'devi'

(goddess). It appears that the cow was being raised to the status of divinity and there was a great revulsion of feeling about the cow. The great usefulness of the cow and the or for agrioultural purposes, in the family economy and as means of exchange must bave powerfully contributed to making the cow a divinity. In the grhya sūtras (like Asv. I. 24. 25 ). Rg. VIII. 101. 15 is prescribed as the mantra when in the Madhu. parka ceremony the cow is let loose by the guest. The Artharvam veda (XII. 4) fully recognises the oult of the holiness of the cow. That the cow continued to be offered in sacrifices follows fron several Brahmana passages o. g. Tai. Br. III. 9. 8. In the Sat. Br. III. 1. 2. 21 it is stated that the great sage Yājõavalkya was wont to eat the meat of cows and oxen provided it was *amsala "1850 ( tender?). The Ait. Br. (6. 8 )1851 states that the horse, the ox, the goat and ram are sacrificial animals while the kimpuruşa, gauramrga, gavaya, the camel and sarabha ( a mythical animal with eight feet) were not sacrificial and their flesh should not be eaten. The Sat. Br. I. 2. 3. 9 contains & similar prohibition. The Sat. Br. XI. 7. 1. 3 declares that meat is the best kind of food.' The work of Mr. L. L. Sundara Ram ( Madras, 1927) on "Cow Protection in India' contains an exhaustive treatment of the subject from Vedic times and cites the attitude of other nations and religions towards cow-killing. The veneration for the cow has been so great that pañcagavya prepared from the five substances due to the cow viz, her milk, ourds and ghee of her milk, her urine and dung mixed with water in which kusa blades had been placed was looked upon as 185% purification for many lapses. Yāj. III. 314 mentions the ingredients of pañcagavya. The Baud. gr. šeşa-sútra ( II. 20) contains an elaborate note on the prepa ration of pancagavya, the quantities of the five ingre. dients, the Vedic verses to be recited when preparing it.

Matsyapurana 267. 5-6 and other works contain similar rules. Parāsara prescribes that the urine, dung, milk, curds and ghee should be of cows the colours of which are respeotively dark, white, copper-red, dark-red and brown or that all ingredients may be of a brown ( kapila ) cow. There is some difference of view about colours and also about the quantities. According to Parāsara urine, ghee, and water should be one part each, curds three parte, milk seven parts and cowdung as much as the thumb. According to Atri. 299 dung, urine, ghee and milk were to be respectively 1, 2, 4 and 8 parts and ourds also 8 parts. Wben mixing the ingredients, urine is taken with the sacred Gayatri, cowdung with 'gandhadvārām'(Tai. Ār. X. 1), milk with 'apyāyasya'(Rg. I. 91. 16), curds with 'dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39.6 ), ghee with 'tejosi sukram' (Vāj. S. 22. 1) and kusa water with devasya tvā'( Ait. Br. 37. 3, Vāj. s. 22. 1). The pañoagavya thus prepared is to be placed near the fire, then it is to be stirred to the accompaniment of 'āpo bi şthā (Rg. X. 9.1-3) and then the mantra' mā nastoke' ( Rg. I. 114. 8 ) is to be repeated over it, it may be then offered into fire with green darbhas not less than seven to the accompaniment of Iravati' (Rg. VII. 99.3 ). . idam Visnur'( Rg. I. 22. 17), 'mā nastoke' (Rg. X. 114. 8), and the samvati verse (Rg. X. 9.4) and then the remainder is to be drunk by one who prepares it with the verso noted below. 1883 The vessel in which the pañoagavya is to be prepared must be of copper or gold or of palasa or lotus leaves (Par. M. II. 1 p. 434 quoting Prajāpati). Vişnu Dh. S. 54.7 and Atri 300 say that a sūdra drinking pañcagavya and a brābmans drinking surā (liquor distilled from flour) are equally sinful and fall in hell. But Devala 61 and Parabara XI. 3 and 27 allow sūdras (and women) to take pancagavya but without Vedio mantras. Therefore the digests like Südra kamalakara ( p. 42 ) say that a sūdra can take panoagavya only as & prāyas-citta (penanos ) for & sin and not otherwise. Panoagavga is also called brahmakūrca. Atri 301 declares that the dung of a cow that eats unolean things is not to be einployed for purification. A smrti passage declares that he in whose house there is not even one cow with her calf becomes devoid of all mangalas ( auspicious things) and darkness does not

leave him. A cow was said to be holy in all limbs except her mouth (Medhatithi on Manu V. 128 quotes 'gāvo medhya mukhkd-ite') and so Manu V. 124 requires food smelt or licked by a cow to be purified. Manu XI. 79 says that if one sacrifices one's life in defence of brāhmaṇas and cows one becomes free from the sin of even brālmaņa murder. Vişņu Dh. 8. 16. 18 declares that even an untouchable ( bāhya ) went to heaven by giving his life in defence of brahmanas, cows, women and children. Vide Vişņu Dk. 8. 3. 45 also. In Gaut. IX. 13-14 the cow is referred to as devatā. As early as the 2nd century A.D. we have the colloostion of the words 'go-brāhmanahita' (the welfare of cows and brahmanas) in an inscription of Rudradāman ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 44). Vide Gupta inscriptions p. 89 ( for go brābmana.purogabbyaḥ sarvaprajābhyaḥ). These words also ocour frequently in the Rāmāyaṇa (Balakāņda 26. 5, Aranya 23. 28 ) and in the Matsyapurāpa 104. 16. The Kapilā (brown) Cow was said to be the most auspicious and meant for provi ding milk for agnihotra and brābmaņas, and the sūdra who used its milk was deemed to go to hell (vide Věddha Gautama p. 568). 

In spite of the prevalence of animal sacrifices, there are already in the times of the Rg, traces of the conception that a devout offering of praise or of a fuel-stick or of cooked food was as good as a more solemn sacrifice (Rg. VIII. 19. 5, VIII. 24. 20) and that oblations of food made to the accompaniment of heart-felt hymns become like bulls, oxen and cows in sacrifice. 1854 These verses are quoted by the Aśv. gr. S. (I. 1. 4) and explained ( vide p. 677 above). The Sat. Br. XI. 6. 1. 3 1855 adumbrates the later doctrine that the enter of meat is eaten in the next birth by the animal killed. The Chāndogya Up. III. 17 regards that tapas, charity, straightforwardness, ahińsā and speaking the truth are the fee ( of the symbolic saorifioe). The same Up. (VIII. 15. 1) emphasizes that the wise man who has attained correct knowledge does not cause any injury to bhūtas except in the case of sacred rites and reaches the world of brahma and does not return to sainsāra. 1856 It appears that the causes that led on to the giving up of flesh at least by some people were

many, the foremost being the metaphysical conception that one Supreme Entity pervades the whole universe, that all life was one, and that even the meanest insect was a manifestation of the divine Essence and that pbilosophical truths would not dawn upon the man who was not restrained, free from crude appetites and had not universal kindliness and sympathy. Another motive for the insistence on ahimsā was probably the idea of debilement oaused by eating flesh (vide note 1810 above about *abārasuddhi'). Sankha asks people to give up flesh, wine, onions and garlso because the body is built up on the food eaten.'57 The notion that the eator of flesh would be devoured by the eaten in the next birth bad pothing to do with the early stages of the dootrine of ahimsā, though by Manu and others that notion was later on exploited to emphasize its importance. Further as the Aryans spread over middle, east and south India anitaal food be came unnecessary owing to the climate and the abundance of corn and vegetables. Though opinions may differ as to the causes.it oannot be gainsaid that the phenomenon of the voluntary giving up of meat by vast populations in the continent of India, when their ancestors had been meat-eaters for ages, is unique in the history of the whole world ist We shall find that even when the doctrines of karma and transmigration were in full swing, the taking of life for food and in sacrifice was allowed by all the ancient dharmasütras. Even the Vedantasūtre (III. 1. 25 ) does not admit that the killing of animals in sacrifice is impure. The Bộ, Up. wbich contains a full statement of the doctrine of trar Imigration (VI.2) recommends (VI. 4. 18 ) to the man who desires that a learned son be born to him the cooking of a mess of the flesh of a bull or ox or of other flesh with rice and ghee. "* "Not only other animals, but even the cow, was on certain occasions killed according to the grhya and dharma sutras on several occasions e.g. (1) in śrāddhas ( Āp. Db, S. II. 7, 16. 25 ).

In the Dharmasūtras numerous rules are given about the flesh of beasts and birds and about fishes. Gaut. 17. 27-31, Ap. Dh. 8. I. 5. 17. 35, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 39-40, Yāj. I. 177, Vişnu Db. 8. 51. 6, Sankba (quoted by Aparārka p. 1167), Rāmi. yaņa (Kişkindhā 17. 39), Markandey a-purāņa (35, 2-4) presoribe that one should avoid the flesh of all five-nailed animals except 1880 of porcupine, hare, svūvdh (a boar or hedge hog), iguana, rhinoceros and tortoise ( some of these works omit the rhinoceros ). Gautama adds that one should also avoid the flesh of all animals with two rows of teeth in the two jaws, of hairy animals, of hairless animals (like snakes), of village cooks and hogs and of cows and bulls. Ap. Dh. 8. I. 5. 17. 29-31 first forbids the flesh of animals with one hoof only, of camels, of gavaya (Gayal), of the village bog, of the sarabha and of cows, but adds the exception that the flesh of milch cows and of bulls may be eaten as the Vājasanoyaka deolares the flesh of these to be pure. Ap. Dh. S. (II. %. 5. 15 ) forbids the use of flesh to a teacher of the Veda in the months from upākarma to utsarjana. This shows that even brāhmaṇas who alone would ordinarily be teachers could take meat in the other months of the year. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 4 declares that a student had not to observe anadhyāya if he ato stale food or uncooked flesh. Āp. Dh. 8. II. 3. 7. 4 says that if flesh was offered to & guest, the merit was equal to the performance of the Dvādasaha sacrifice. The Mahābbāsya of Patañjali ( vol. III. p. 320) states that the precept 'a village cock or hog is not fit to be eaten leads to the inference that a town hog also is unfit food as meat.' Vas. Dh. 8. XI. 34 1881 goes so far as to say that if an ascetio does not partake of flesh when requested to do so in a śrāddha or in a rite for the gods he falls into hell for numberless years. Gradually, however, & change came over the sentiments of the people. Megasthenes (p. 99 ) and Strabo (XVI. 1. 59) state that the first caste of philosophers which is divided into two sub-divisions, viz. Brachmanes and Sarmanes ( gramapas )

abstained from animal food and sexual intercourse (probably as brahmacarins) and that after living in this manner for 37 years they began to live with less restraint and began to eat the flesh of animals, particularly of those that did not assist man in his labour. The Great Emperor Asoka declares in his first Rook Edict how originally thousands of animals were killed in the royal kitchens, how he then brought down the númber to two peacocks and one deer daily and how he had résolved to discontinue the slaughter of even this limited number thereafter. Vide also the 2nd and 4th Rock Edicts. In the fifth pillar edict (Delhi-Topra ) the Emperor Asoka notes that when he had been twenty-six years on the throne he declared numerous animals (such as parrots, mainas, hamgasi cakravākas, tortoises, porcupines, fishes &c.) to be avadhya (not to be killed). The general rule as stated 1868 by Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 3. 12 and the Rāmāyaṇa (quoted above on p. 733 ) was that from that food that was either cooked or got ready for the daily meals of a householder, homa and bali were to be made. Ancient works spoke of meat offerings to gods and in madhu parka and brāddha. Therefore some of the emptis like those of Manu and Vasiştha are in two minds about the use of filesh. Manu (V. 27-44 ) at first contains & permission to kill animals only in madhuparka, in sacrifices1868 and in rites for gods and manes and on no other occasion. Manu (V.27 and 32) further says that no sin is incurred in flesh-eating when one's life is in danger (owing to famine or disease ) and when a person partakes of the remnants of the flesh of an animal purchased by him or reared by him or flesh given by another out of what is prepared for offering to gods and manes. Yāj. I. 179 is to the same effect. Manu further clinches his exhortation not to eat animal food by ordaining that he who kills an animal except for the limited purposes stated above is himself killed for as many births as there are hair on the body of the slaughtered animal (Vişnu Dh. S. 51, 60 is also the same). Manu then goes on to declare (V. 40 and 44 = Vişnu Dh. S. II. 63, 67 ) that herbs or plants, animals, trees (of which sacrifioial posts are made ), lower animals, birds, that meet destruction for the sake of performing

sacrifices are born again in better forms ( of existence ) and that hińsā ( killing of or injury to sentient beings ) done according to the dictates of the Veda should be understood as no himsā. 1864 since dharma shines forth from Veda alone. Though Vasiştha Dh. S. (in 14. 39-40 ) allows the flesh of five five-nailed animals and of animals with one row of teeth (except oamels). and also of certain birds and kinds of fish, yet in VI, 5-6 it takes up the same position as that of Manu viz. that himsā was allowed only in sacrifices &c. From V. 46-55 Manu takes up the position of total abstention from killing animals even in sacrifices (they are the same as Vişnu Dh. S. 51. 69-78). In one verge ( V. 48 which is the same as Vas. Dh. S. IV. 7) Manu says that no flesh can be had without killing living beings and killing such beings cannot lead to heaven; therefore one should give up flesh. Verses 53 and 56 are very important as they convey that the merit of him who performs a horge sacrifice every year for a hundred years and of him who does not partake of flesh (throughout life ) is equal and that the word mūrsa (flesh) is derived by the wise (from 'm&m' and 'saħ') as meaning 'he whose flesh I eat to day will devour me in the next world or birth.' Yāj. I. 181 is just like Manu V.53. Maņu winds up the whole discussion (in V.56) by stating that natural appetites lead men on to eat flesh or to drink wine or to indulge in sexual gratifioation and there is no sin in indulging in these when they are allowed by the śāstra in the case of certain persons and on certain occasions; but abstention in these matters (even on occasions when they are permitted by the šāstras ) leads to great rewards.1808 From these passages in

Manu, Vispu and Vas, it is clear that when the extant works attributed to these authors were composed, they themselves were staunch upholders of ahimsā, but that there were two classes of people in their days who were not opposed to flesh-eating, one class holding that killing animals only for purposes for which the Veda expressly sanctioned hiinsū was not improper and another class that indulged in flesh-eating without restrictions. That in spite of the individual predilections of the author of the Manusmrti, general usage was different even in Manu's day is indicated by the fact that in III. 227 Manu says that in sraddha the performer should get ready various kinds of food including flesh of tempting varieties. Yāj. I. 258-260 states how flesh of various animals when served in grāddha to the brahmanas invited tends to gauge satisfaction to the Manes for long periods. Bphas pati quoted by Sarvajña-Nārāyapa explained Manu V. 27 as a pari samkhyā i. e. Manu does not enjoin flesh-eating on the four ocoasions stated, but only permits it and forbids it on other occasions. 1886 Centuries were required before the views pro pounded by Manu became predominant. Gradually large seo tions of the population of India gave up flesh-eating and even those who did not regard it as forbidden to them rarely partook of it or did so in an apologetic way. The spread of Vaişpavism tended to wean people from flesh as required by the Bhagavata purapa 1867 (VII. 15. 7-8) which is to the Vaişpavas what the Bible is to the Christians. In medieval and modern times all brahmanas avoid flesh (except some brābmaņas in northern and eastern India that hold that fish may be eaten); BO also do many vaisyas, particularly those who are Vaişpavas and even among südras there are many who do not touch flesh and regard abstention from flesh as meritorious. From ancient times the kşatriyas have been meat-eaters. The Mahabharata hag in several places to say & great deal on flesh-eating. In the Vanaparva 50. 4 it is stated that the Pāņdava beroes killed with unpoisoned arrows deer and first offered venison to brāhmaṇas and partook of it themselves. In Sabha 4. 1-2 king Yudhisthira on the opening of Mayasabha feasted ten thousand brābmanas with various delicacies including the flesh of wild boars and

Vanaparva 208. 11-121868 offers the consoling thought (that is conveyed by the Rgveda itself) that animals killed in sacri. fices to the accompaniment of Vedio mantras went to heaven and it narrates the story of king Rantideva in whose sacrifices two thousand animals and cows were killed every day. Anu śāgana 116. 8 contains the view that there is nothing so nourish. ing as meat for those who are wounded or weak or worried or who are given up to too much sexual gratification and those exhausted by long travel. Anugāgana 116. 16-19 allows flesh of animals killed by hunting to kşatriyas. There are some passages where the Mahabharata contains the same sentiments as those of Manu e. g. Anušāgana 115 highly praises abstention from meat and a few verses of this chapter (e. g. 115. 44-45, 48) are very similar to Manu's (V. 27, 51 ). Sankha quoted by Aparārka p. 1167 allows the flesh of buffaloes, goats, rams, ruru deer, ordinary deer and spotted deer. Hārita quoted in the Gr. R. P. 375 mentions the flesh of goats, rams, buffaloes, deer of Various kinds (ruru, prsata, nyanku, škşa ), rhinoceros, and large forest boars as permissible, while Devala quoted by the same forbids the flesh of COWB, asses, camels, horges, elephants, lions, tigers, bears, sarabhas, snakes, boa constrictor, rats and mice, cats, mongoose, village hog, dog, jackal, animals of un known species, cheettas, dark-faced apes, monkeys and human beings. Manu V.51 ( = Vişnu Dh. 8. 51. 74) says that he who gives consent to the killing of an animal ( for food ), who cuts off the limbs, who kills the animal, who sells or purchases meat, who cooks it, who serves meat and the ester of meat these are all guilty of killing Yama ( quoted in Ahn. Pr. p. 533 ) says that the eater is the greatest sinner out of these, &s, if there were no eators of meat, no one would kill animals for food. 

Gaut. 17. 29 and 34-35, Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 32-34, Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 48, Vişnu Dh. 8. 51. 29-31, Manu V. 11-14, Yaj. I. 172-175 contain long lists of birds the flesh of which was forbidden and of those the flesh of whioh was allowed. A few of these may be noted. All birds that subsist on raw flesh ( vultures &c.), the cātaka, parrot, hamsa, all birds that dwell in a village ( auch es pigeons), baka, birds that scratch dungbills for food are forbidden; while wild cocks and peacocks were permitted. On Jaimini V. 3.26-28 Sabara quotes a Vedic text that one who has

constructed the fire altar (agnicit) should not eat the flesh of birds till the sacrifice he has embarked on is finished. 

About fish there is no unanimity. Ap. Da. S. I. 5. 17. 36-37 says among fish the ceta ( long-nosed orocodile ? ) is forbidden, 80 also are fish with snake-like heade, the makara, fish that subsist on dead flesh, fish that have strange forms (such as those that have heads like men, or that look like elephants ).' Manu on the other hand regards fish-eating as the worst form of flesh-eating and forbids all fish (V. 14-15 ), but then makes an exception (V. 16) in favour of fish called Pāțhina and Robita if used in rites for gods and Manes and fish called rajiva, lion-faced fish and fish having scales. Vide Vas. Dh. S. 14. 41-42, Gaut. 17. 36, Yāj. I. 177-178 also. 

About milk several rules are stated in the smṛtis. Gaut. 17. 22-26, Ap. Dh. 8. 1.5, 17, 22-24, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 34-35, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5, 156-158, Manu V. 8-9, Vişnu Dh. S. 51. 38-41, Yaj. I. 170 lay down that the milk of a cow that is sandhini, 1869 the call of which is dead, that gives birth to twins and that has not passed ten days after delivery, from whose udders milk oozes of itself, is forbidden. The milk of sheep and she-buffaloes also is not to be used until the lapse of ten days after delivery. The milk of ewes, of camels and of all animals with one hoof is altogether forbidden. The Mit. (on Yaj. T. 170) notes that even the ourds and other products of such milk as is forbidden are also forbidden, but Visvarûpa thought that only the milk of a cow whose calf is dead, or who is sandhini, or who has not passed ten days after delivery is forbidden and not curds and other produota thereof. The milk of even a cow that feeds' on impure food should not be used 1870 (Vişgu Dh. 8. 51. 41 and Atri verse 301 ). In the Vayupurāņa even the milk of she buffaloes is forbidden. 1871 Baud. Dh. 8. (L. 5. 159-160) prescribes the ponance called Prājāpatya for drinking forbidden milk of all animals except the cow and a fast for three days for drink 

1869. The word sandbinl' is explained in throe ways as a cow in boat', 'that gives milk once a day', 'a cow that yields milk on account of another calf being brought to it, its own being dead'. Vide Mit. on Yaj. I. 170.

ing the milk of a cow when forbidden. Apastamba-smrti (in Verse) forbids the milk of a kapila cow to all except to brāhmaṇas and the Bharişyapurāņa says that even a brahmana is to use only such portion of the milk of such a cow that remains after employing it in rites for gods.1878 The Brahma* puršņa says 'one should not partake of curds at night even if one is starting on a journey, but in madbuparka it may be used at night. Ill-luck dwells in fried grain by day and in curds and barley by night and in Kovidāra and Kapittha ( trees or fruits ) at all times' ( quoted in Gr. R. p. 370). Manu IV. 75 forbids the eating after sunset of all food in which gesame are mixed. 

Several herbs and vegetables have been forbidden from very ancient times. According to Āp. Dh. 8. (1. 5. 17. 25-27) all herbs from which liquors are distilled, kalañja (red garlic ), palāndu (onions), parārska ( dark garlio) and whatever similar vegetables are not used by respectable people, should not be eaten; and a brābmaņa text prescribes that 'kyāku' (mush rooms) are forbidden. Gaut. 17. 32-33 forbids tender leaves (of trees), kyāku, lasuna and the resins of trees and the red sap flowing from incisions made in the barks of trees. Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 33 forbids the eating of lasuna, palāņdu, kyāku, gğñja na (turnip), Sleşmātaka, the resins of trees and red sap (as in Gautama ). Manu V. 5-6 forbids lasuna, palandu, grājana, musbrooms ( kavaka ) and all herbs that spring from impure soil and manure, red resins and red sap (as in Gautams) and selu ( sleşmātaka ) fruit. Yāj. I. 171 and 176 adds sigru and pres oribes the penance of cāndrāyana for eating forbidden herbs and vegetables. The great difficulty is to find out the modern equivalents of some of the herbs and vegetables. According to & verse quoted in Gș. R. p. 356 from the Smrtimañjari there are ten varieties of palāņdu of which gļājana 1873 is one. Aparārka p. 249 quotes passages from the Brahmapurāņa forbidding various kinds of herbs and vegetables. Vide also Gr. R. pp. 354-356 for quotations from Devala and others about herbs and

vegetables that are forbidden. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 290 quotes a gūtra of Sumantu that lasuna and other vegetables are not forbidden to those who are ill, if they are prescribed by way of medicine. 1884 About asafoetida (hingu ) Haradatta on Gaut. 17, 32 says 'it is doubtful whether it is a resin or is & sap flowing from incisions, but even respectable people partake of it and that camphor not being red nor & resin nor a sap may be eaten.' The Sm. O. (op brāddha p. 413 ) says that some smrtis forbid the use of hingu in grāddba, while the Adipurāna allows it and therefore there is an option. The Gr. R. p. 354 shows that the round alību (gourd ) was forbidden. Vțddha-Harita VII. 113-119 mentions herbs, vegetables and fruits that are forbidden. Vide also the Sinftimuktāphala (abnika pp. 434-435 ) for quotations as to the names of several roots, fruits and vegetables that were fobid. den together with their South Indian names. 

Ap. Dh. 8. II. 8. 18. 2 forbids the use of dark grains (like māşa beans) in srāddha. The Mahabhāşya says 'when it is declared that māsa beans should not be eaten, they are not to be eaton even when other grains of oorn are mixed up with them' (vol. I. p. 127) 1875 The Gr. R. p. 359 quotes the Brahmapurāņa "iT6 forbidding the use of certain cereals generally such as rājamāşa, sthūlamudga (called 'metbi' in Marathi), masura &c. Sankha Likhita 1897 quoted in Ahn, Pr. p. 394 allows the employment in offering to gods of all cereals, except kodrava, canaka ( gram ), māga, magūra, kulattha and uddalaka. Vrddha-Hārsta VII. 110-111 also mentions the corns that are forbidden. 

Gaut. 17. 14-16, Ap. Dh. 8.1.5.17.17-19, Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 28-29 and 37-38, Manu V. 10, 24-25, Yāj. I. 167 prescribe that cooked food which has become sour by being kept for some time or by being mixed with something else should not be eaten nor should stale (over which the day or night has passed ) food be eaten, nor food cooked twice ( with interval) except curds and butter milk and except stale articles like vegetables, cakes, fried grain,

porridge, pulse cakes, those boiled in oil and rioe boiled in milk or when mixed with honey; and that even stale food flavoured with ghee or ourds or the remnant of food offered to the gods may be eaten. Manu V. 25, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 37-38, Ap. Dh, S, I. 5. 17. 19 and Yāj. I. 169 say that articles of wheat and yava flour and products of milk though stale and unmixed with ghee may be eaten by all dvijātis, provided they have not turned 

sour. 

The above long lists of forbidden vegetables, meat, milk furnish examples of food that is jātiduşta or svabhāvaduş ta. The rules about not eating stale and sour food illustrate food that is küladuşta. Any article of food which is mixed up with forbidden things like palāndu or is in contact with unclean substances or food in which hair or an inseot is found or in which uxoreta or the limb or tail of a mouse is found, food touched by a woman in her monthly course or in which & bird (like the crow ) has thrust its beak or food touched by a dog or smelt by & cow or food from a house in mourning or from a family in impurity due to birth should be avoided ( vide Ap. Dh. $. I. 5. 16. 19-20 and 24-29, Manu IV, 207-209, 212, 217, Yāj. I. 167-168 ). If a dog or an apapātra sees food which & man is eating or if a person when engaged in taking his meal sees a cān. dāla, & dog, a crow or a cock or 8 woman in her course, he should leave the food and get up. Manu (III.239-240) says that a cāņdala, a village hog or a village cook or a dog, & menstruating woman and an impotent person should not be allowed to see brāhmaṇas eating, whether in rites for gods or Manes, or at times of gifts. Kātyāyana says that if & brāhmaṇa hears the voice of a cāņdāla, a patita, or a woman in her course he should at once leave eating and if he eats even one morsel after hearing their voice he has to observe a fast for one day. 1878 The rules about not eating food from a house in mourning illustrate food that is nimittaduşta (forbidden by reason of an occasion or chance reason ), the other rules about food

forbidden because of contact with unclean things or with garlic &c. exemplify samsarga-duşta (forbidden because of contact) and the rules about avoiding food seen by a dog &o. are examples of kriya-duşta (forbidden on account of certain actions ). The smrti writers were not devoid of practical common sense, Baud. Dh, S. II. 7. 7 says that if in a heap of cooked food, hair, bits of nails or skin or insects or dung of rats is seen, then a lump from that part where these are seen should be taken out and the rest should have water sprinkled over it and holy ashes should be scattered over it and water should be again sprinkled over it and brāhmaṇas should then louldly declare the food to be all right and it may be then used for serving. Vaik. 1879 IX. 15 contains a similar direction. Parā. sara VI. 71-74 says that cooked food (rice) amounting in quantity to one drona or one ādhaka, 1880 if licked by a dog or by a orow or smelt by a cow or an ass, should not be thrown away, but should be purified and then used, and that the portion spoilt by touch &c. should be taken away from the whole mass, the rest should be sprinkled over with water in which & golden piece has been dipped and fire should be brought in contact with it (by ignited darbha ) and brāhmanas should recite Vedic texts over it and then it may be served. Vas. Db. 8. 14. 23 and 25–26, Yaj. I. 189 and 191 contain similar rules. 1881 

Food cooked only for oneself and not for offering to gods or guests should not be eaten (Gaut, 17, 19, Manu IV. 213 ). This is called samskāra-duşta ( forbidden on account of the absence of purificatory rites ) by the Smrtyarthasāra p. 68. The largest number of injunctions are concerned with parigrahaduşta (food which may be good in itself but is forbidden because of its coming from the hands of or being owned by certain persons ), The following is a fairly comprehensive list of such persons compiled from Ap. Dh. 8. I. 6.18. 16-33 and I. 6. 19.1, Gaut. 15.18 and 17. 17-18, Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 2-11, Manu IV. 205-220, Yāj.

son of a punarbhū, & worker in hides, & potter, a spy, one who becomes an ascetio without following the rules laid down for that asrama, a lunatio, one who has sat down at his debtor's house in dharna. Manu IV. 222 prescribes a fast for three days if a brahmana partakes of the food of these unknowingly, but the kycchra ( Prajapatya ) for knowingly doing so. Baud. Dh. 8. II. 3. 10 prescribes the japa of Rg. IX. 58 (tarat sa mandi ) for eating the food of one from whom it should not have been taken. Manu XI. 253 and Visņu Dh. S. 56. 6 do the same. 

The next question is whose food may be taken. Great fluc tuations have occurred in the usages during the last two thousand years or more in this matter. Gaut. 17. 1 says 'a brahmana may eat at the houses of all dvijātis ( the three higher varpas ) who are well-known to be performing the peculiar duties of their varna or aśrama." Gaut. 2. 41, Baud. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 18-19, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 3. 25 allow a brahmacarin to beg for food at the houses of men of all varnas, except those who are apapātra and abhitasta ( suspected of mahāpātakas). Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 18. 9 first prescribes for a brāhmapa who has returned from his teacher's house that he should not eat in the houses of the ksatriya and other varnas (as a general rule ), then he gives the opinion of some that he may take food from members of all varnas except sūdras, provided they abide by the rules for their varpa. He also notices that even sūdra's food may be eaten if he serves a dvijāti in virtue of his duty to do so. Even Veda. Vyāga III. 56 expressly declares that all dvijālis who know each other's families may partake of food at each other's houses. 1884 Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 2-12 raises the question as to whose food may be eaten and names several sages who differed in their views. Kanva said that one may eat the food of only him who wishes to give (and so requests ), Kautsa thought that one may eat the food of him only who is holy (punya ); Varsyāyaṇi said that one may accept from whoever is liberal enough to give; Eka, Kupika, Kanva, Kutse and Puşkarasādi held that alms (food) offered by a pure man may be eaten; Vārsyayani said what is offered by any body without asking may be accepted ; according to Hārita one should not accept food whioh is offered after an express previous announcement 'I shall give you such and such a kind of food.' Āpastamba's own view appears to have been ( I. 6. 19. 9-11) that one should accept the food of him whose conduct is religious and who

Bhojana-whose food may be eaten 

1789 

desires to offer food, that one should not accept the food even of a righteous man if he shows even the slightest unwillingness to give and that whatever is offered unasked may be accepted. These directions are rather vague. 

In modern times a person is more lax in taking food pre pared with oil or ghee or milk. He may take such food from members of certain castes otber than his own. But ordinarily he would not take food cooked in water from any person belong. ing to another caste or even sub-division of the same caste. In towns and cities there is a strong tendenoy to considerably relax these restrictions. We saw above that in the times of Gautama and Apastamba and others a brāhmaṇa was allowed to take food prepared in the houses of kşatriyas, vaisyas, and even sūdras. Gradually this latitude came to be restricted and most of tho gūtras and early gmptis restrict the liberty to take food from sūdras by saying that only from the following among śūdras a brāhmana can take cooked food, viz, one who cultivates the brāhmana's field on the system of paying half of the crops to the latter, & family friend, one's cowherd, one's barber, one doing personal service i. 6. & dāsa ( vide Gaut. 17. 6, Manu IV. 253, Visņu Dh. S. 57. 16, Yāj. I. 166, Angiras 120-121, Veda. Vyāsa III, 55 and Parāśara XI. 21 ). Manu and Yāj. add that any sūdra who declares to a brāhmaṇa that the former is going to be dependent on the latter and who declares what his actions have been and how he will serve the brahmana is also bhojyānna (one whose food may be eaten). The Mit. quotes a sūtra wbich includes the potter among these (on Yāj. I. 166 ) and Devala also does so, 1885 It may be stated that Parāśara (XI. 22-24) gives peculiar meanings to the words dāga, nāpita, gopāla and ardhika. The general rule forbidding the food of sūdras is stated by Vas. Dk. 8. 14. 4, Manu IV. 211 and 223, Yāj. I 160. Angiras 121 says that he who takes cooked food from sūdras other than the five excepted above has to undergo cāndrāyaṇa penance. Atri ( 172-173 ) prescribes the same penance for'a dvijs eating the food of a washerman, an actor and & worker in bamboos and the penance of parāka for taking the food of or residing amongst antyajas.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Ch. XXII 

VI. 26-29, Angiras 69-70, Ap. ( verse) 8.9-11 severely condemn a brahmana partaking of food from südrag. Angiras 75, Ap. ( verse ) VIII. 8-9 declare that a brāhmaṇe who is an agnihotrin and yet does not desist from sūdra food loses five viz. his self, his vedio lore and his three ( sacred fires ). Medhātithi on Manu V. 84 expressly states that the barber is touchable and bhojyānna ( whose food may be taken). This shows that up to the 9th century A, D, the rules about taking food from even Certain gūdras had not become rigid in all provinces of India. Angiras 77-78. Ap. ( verse ) 8. 11-13 and Yama ( quoted in Gr. R. P. 334 ) declare that a brāhmaṇa may eat at a brāhmaṇa's at all times, at & kşatriya's only on parvans (on full moon &c. ), at & vaisya's when the latter is initiated for a sacrifice, at a sūdra's never and the food of the four varnas is respectively like nectar, milk, food and blood. 1888 According to Manu IV. 223 a brāhmaṇa could take from a sūdra uncooked food for a night, if he had no other means of subsistence. When exaotly brāhmaṇas were forbidden to take food from kşatriyas or vaisyas it is difficult to say. In the Kalivarjya section all that is forbidden is taking food from the five sūdras enumerated in Manu IV. 253. Gaut. 17.1 prescribes that fuel, water, fodder, roots, fruits, honey, protection, what is offered unasked, a bed, seat, shelter, conveyance, milk, ourds, roasted grain, safari ( small fish ), priyangu (millet ), & garland, meat of deer, vegetables must not be refused when offered by any one spontaneously. Vas. Dh. S. 14. 12, Manu IV. 50 are to the same effect. Angiras 1887 quoted in Gr. R. p. 337 states that cow's milk, barley flour, oil, oil-cakes, cakes (of flour) may be taken from a sūdra and eaten and whatever else is cooked in milk. Bșhat-Parāśara VI. says "uncooked meat, ghee, honey and oils extracted from fruits, even if they are kept in a mleccha's vessel, become pure the moment they are taken out of suoh veggel; similarly milk, curds, and ghee contained in Vessels of ābhiras are blameless and the vessels are pure as long as these articles are contained in them. 1888 Laghu-Sātātapa 128

says that corn lying in the field or on the threshing floor, water drawn from wells and milk while still in the cow enclosures may be taken even from one whose food is forbidden. Even such later writers as Haradatta stated that a brāhmans may eat the food of the five sūdras named by Manu IV. 253 in extreme distress only. 

Certain articles were not to be eaten at certain stages only. For example, a brahmacārin was not to partake of honey, meat, and kşāra-lavana ( vide Āp. Db. 8. I. 1. 4. 6, Mānava gr. I. 1. 12). But in danger of life he could eat even these (vide Medhātithi on Manu V. 27). Similarly a forest hermit and on ascetic were forbidden many things ( which will be discussed later on). A 5şatriya was not to drink soma juice (vide p. 140 above ). 

There were rules about the persons who might be engaged to cook and serve food. As brāhmaṇas could in very ancient times eat the food of all varnas including at least some sūdras, no difficulty must have been felt. The Āp. Dh. S. (II. 2. 3. 1-6 ) prescribes that āryas (i. e. the three varnas ) purified (by & bath ) may prepare the food for vaišvadeva; they should stop speaking, coughing or spitting with their faces turned towards the food that is being prepared and should touch water on touch. ing their hair, limbs or garment; or sūdras supervised by aryas may be the cooks. Āp. Dh. 8, further requires that when gūdras are cooks they should shave their hair and beard and pare their nails every day or on the 8th day or parva days and they must always bathe with thoir olothes on. Laghu-Asv. I. 176 says that food should be cooked by one's wife, daughter-in-law, son, pupil, elderly relative, or one's ācārya or by oneself. Aparārka (p. 500 ) quotes a verse of Nārāyana that food must be served to a dvijāti by a wife of the same caste ( if he has wives of different oastes ). 

Although numerous rules are laid down about the persons at whose house food may or may not be taken, the ideal placed before householders was that they should not as far as possible eat at the houses of others and should only do so if they are invited by a blameless person ( vide Gaut. 17. 8, Manu III. 104, Yaj. I. 112). Manu III. 104 holds out the threat that those who constantly seek to subsist on the food given by others become after death the cattle of those who give them food. 

It is necessary to say a few words on drinking liquor ( madyapāna).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

( Ch. XXII 

In the Rgveda a distinction is made between soma and sura (liquor ), the former being an intoxicating drink, but reserved for being offered (as a sacred beverage) to gods and to be drunk by the priests, while the latter seems to have been meant as a beverage for common men and not usually offered to gode. In Rg. VII. 86. 6 the sage 1889 Vasiştha implores Varuna to recognize that a man does not commit sin by his own urge or power, but that it is due to destiny or surā, anger, dice ( gambl ing) or heedlessness. In Rg. VIII. %. 12 the sage exclaims that draughts of some when quaffed by Indra create in his heart such tumult as those who are heavily intoxicated engage in when surā is drunk. Rg. I. 116,7 mentions among the deeds of Asvins this that they filled & hundred jars of surā from the hoof of their powerful horse which (hoof) was like kārotara (a strainer or leather-bag?). Rg. I. 191. 10 refers to the leather-bag (of wine ) in the house of & vintner. In belauding bhojas ( liberal mon) Rg. X. 107. 9 says that they won the inner draught of surā (from their foes ). In Rg. X. 131. 1890 4 and 5 the Asvins are praised for having drunk surāms (surā mixed with soma) and helped Indra in his fight with the Asura Namuoi. In the Atharvaveda IV. 34. 6 the reward for the per former of sacrifices is said to be heaven in which there are lakes full of ghee and honey, and wherein liquor flows like water. In Atharva veda 14. 1. 35-36 and 15. 9. 2-3 surā is referred to. The Vaj. 8. 19.7 distinguished between surā and soma ' thou art the powerful surā and this is soina ; don't destroy me when thou enterest thy place. In the Tai. 1891 8. II. 5. 1 ff, the Sat. Br. I 6. 3 and V. 5. 4 there is a legend of Visvarūpa, the son of Tvagtr, which narrates how he had three heads, one of which Was soma-drinking, one wine-drinking and a third for eating

food, how Indra cut off the heads of Visvarūpa, how Tvaşır being furious at the slaughter of his son performed a soms Bacrifice from which he excluded Indra, how Indra, though not invited, consumed all the some that was in the tub, how the drinking of too much soma injured Indra and how the gods healed him by the işti called Sautrāmaņi (for Sutrāmap, 'the good protector', Indra). This Sautrāınani sacrifice was per formed for & priest who drank too much soma and therefore either began to vomit or had severe purging. Vide Kātyāyana śr. 19.1.4. It was also performed by him who had an enemy(Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 4). In this sacrifice & brāhmaṇa had to be hired for drinking the dregs of surā offered in it and if one was not found willing to do it the dregs were to be poured on an ant-hill.1882 How surā ( liquor) was prepared is described in the Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3.5 and in Kātyāyana śr. 19. 1. 20-27 ( vide S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 223 n. 2 which summarises the com. on Kātyā. yana ). In Jaimini III. 5. 14-15 there is a discussion about the Sautrāmaņi sacrifice and Sabara quotes the passage of the Tai. Br. I. 8. 6 about hiring a brāhmaṇa for drinking the dregs of the surā offered in the sacrifice. The Sat. Br. contrasts some and of surā by saying 'soma is truth, prosperity, light and surā is untruth, misery, darkness' (V.1.5. 28 ). The Sat. Br. V. 5. 4. 21 expresses dread 1893 of mixing up the libations of some and of surā together. The Kathaka Samhita XII. 12 contains the follow ing interesting remark. "Therefore an elderly person or & youngster, the daughter-in-law and father-in-law drink liquor and remain babbling together; foolishness (or thoughtlessness ) is indeed sin; therefore a brāhmaṇa does not drink surā with the thought otherwise ( if I drink it) I may be affected by sin'; therefore this is for ksatriya ; one should say to a brāhmana that surā, if drunk by & kşatriya, does not harm the latter." 1884 This passage makes it Olear that at the time of the Kathaka Samhita public opinion had come to this stage that brāhmaṇas had generally given up drinking surā. This passage read with the

History of Dharmaśāstra 

( Ch. XXII 

Tai. Br. quoted above establishes that it had become difficult to find a brābmana willing to drink even the remnants of surā left after being offered in a sacred Vedio rite like the Sautrāmani. The above passage from the Kathaka is quoted by the Tantra. vārtika on Jaimini I. 3. 7 (p. 210 ) and explained by it as referring to sidhu (rum ) and liquor prepared from honey. Samkarācārya in his bhāşya on the Vedāntaşütra III. 4. 31 quotes1895 this passage expressly from the Kathaka Samhita. In the Ait. Br. (37. 4) it is stated that when a king has undergone & solemn coronation ceremony the purohita places in his hand a vessel of surā. Aśvapati, king of Kekaya, proudly declares in the Chandogya Up. V. 11.5 to the learned brāhmaṇas that came to him for the lore about Vaišvānara 'in my country there is no thief, no miser, no madyapa ( drinker of intoxicants ), none who has not kept the sacred fires, none who is not learned, no man of loose character; whence can there be a woman of loose character in my country?' In Chāndogya V, 10.9 one who drinks surā is enumerated among the five grave sinners. 

It is somewhat strange that in some of tbe gębya sūtras it is stated that in the rites on Anvaştakā day when pindas are offered to the male ancestors, pindas are offered to the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother and also liquor is offered. For example, the Āśv, gr. II. 5. 5 says that to the wives ( of the ancestors ) are offered surā and the scum of boiled rice in addition'( to the pindas ). 1896 The Pār. gỉ. (III. 3) states also to the female ancestors be makes pipda offerings and pours for them liquor and water oblations into pits.' The Kathaka gs. (65. 7-8) also prescribes that in the Anvaştaka surā was to be sprinkled with a spoon about the pindas for women ancestors and the piņdas were to be eaten by servents or by nişadas or may be thrown in fire or water or brāhmaṇas may eat them. It is difficult to account for this. If & conjeo. ture may be hazarded, it is possible that women drank ( perhaps secretly ) liquor even when their husbands had given up the practice owing to the force of public opinion or that in those days (before the grhya sütras ) intercaste marriages being allowed, the women ancestors might have been ksatriya or

vaisya women and so were not unfamiliar with drinking. Manu XI. 95 forbids drinking to brāhmaṇas and Kullūka notes that there were commentators who held that the prohibition did not apply to brāhmaṇa women. Whatever the reasons for the above directions in the gļhya sūtras may be, they run counter to the prevailing sentiments, not only of the Kathaka Sam, and the Brāhmaṇa texts, but also to the unanimous prescriptions of the dharmasūtras and smrtis. 

Gaut. II. 25,1897 Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 21, Manu XI. 94 forbid all kinds of intoxicants to brāhmaṇas at all stages of life. Ap. Dh. 8. I. 7. 21. 8, Vas. Dh. $. I. 20, Vişnu Dh. S. 35. 1., Manu XI. 54, Yāj. III. 227 hold that drinking surā or madya is one of the grave sins ( mahāpātakas ). In spite of this, the Baud. Dh. $. I. %. 4 notes that among the five peculiar practices of the brāhmanas in the north was that of drinking rum and it condemns all the five practices. The verses of Manu (XI. 93-94 ) 1898 are frequently quoted in digests and commentaries *sura is the filthy refuse of food and sin indeed is called mala (filth); therefore, a brāhmaṇa, a rājanya, and a vsisya should not drink surā, which is of three kinds, viz. prepared from molasses, from flour (or ground grains ) and from flowers of the Madhūka tree; brahmaņas should not drink any one of these three.' The interpretations put on these verses by Visvarūpa on Yāj. (III. 222 ), the Mit. on Yāj. III. 253, Aparārka p. 1069 and others establish that the word ' surā' primarily applies to paistī (liquor prepared from flour ) as Vedic usage in the Sautrānapi sacrifice and elsewhere shows, that paisti is forbidden to all brābmaņas, kşatriyas and vaiśyas, that it is the drinking of paisti alone that constitutes a mahāpātaka, that all intoxicants are forbidden to brāhmaṇas but liquors other than paişti such as those prepared from molasses or madhūka flowers are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaišyes. In the Mahābhārata ( Udyogaparva 59. 5) both Vasudeva and Arjuna are described as intoxicated by drinking tbe liquor prepared from honey and

(Ch. XXII 

the Tantravārtika tries 1899 to establish that there was nothing wrong in this as they were ksatriyas and as Manu XI.93-94 and Gaut. II. 25 are to be construed asstated above viz. all intoxicants are forbidden to brāhmaṇas and oply paişti to ksatriyas and vaisyas, Intoxicants are not forbidden to gūdras, though Vrddha-Harita (IX.277-278) declares that some desire that good sūdras should abstain from surā also and that Manu says that even a südra becomes patita by falsehood, by partak ing of meat and intoxicants and by stealing another's wealth or wife. Another rule was that brahmacārins, of whatever Varpa, had to abstain entirely from every kind of intoxicant (Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 23, Manu II. 177, Yaj. I. 33 ). Visvarupa on Yaj.I.33 refers to a passage from the Caraka-sakha which states that when Ávetaketu suffered from a skin disease ( kilāga ), the Asving told him to take madhu ( honey or wine) and meat as medicine, and when he asked bow being a brahmacārin he could do so, they replied that a person must first gave himself (from disease and death) in all waystoo as a man can say I sball perform meritorious acts 'only if he lives. Aparārka quotes the Brahmapurāpa and says that in the Kali age human sacrifice, Afvamedhs sacrifice and intoxicating drinks were forbidden to the three varnas and to brahmanas in all yugas (ages). But this is opposed to bistory and tradition. 1901 The Mahabhārata narrates ( Adiparva 76-77) the story of Sukra, his daughter Devayani and pupil Kaca and states that Sukra forbade for the first time brahmaņas from drinking intoxicants and decla red that, if any brahmana drank sura thenceforward, he would be guilty of the grave sin of brahmana-murder.1902 The

Mausalapārva (1. 29-30) states that Balarāma prohibited the drinking of sura from the day the musala ( iron pestle) for the destruction of the Yadavas was produced and directed that any breach of his order would be punished with impalement. The Sāntiparva ( 110. 22 ) declares that those men who always avoid honey and meat and intoxicants from their birth surmount all difficulties. Santiparva (34. 20) presoribes that, if a man drank liquor when in danger of life or through ignoranoe, he was to undergo upanayana again. Aco. to Vişnu Dh. 8. 22. 83-851903 intoxicants (madya) forbidden to brāhmaṇas are of ten kinds viz. those prepared from madhuka flowers, from sugarcane juice, from tanka fruit (i. e. kapittha), from koli (i. a. badara or jujube fruit), from dates, from jack-fruit, from grape juice, from honey, from maireya ( extracted from the blossoms of a plant ) and from cocoa-nut sap. Vişnu ad ds that these ten kinds are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaibyas. Pulastya quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 253 and by Aparārka p. 1075 states that surā ( distilled from rice flour) is different from the eleven kinds of madyas that he enumerates (practically the same as in Vişnu). It may be stated that this sentiment against drinking is still very strong among brāhmaṇas and drinking is still looked down upon by all castes, though, owing to contact with the West, some people (even including a few brāhmaṇas ) have come to regard it as a fashionable indulgence. 

Manu IX. 80 and Yāj. I. 73 say that a wife who drinks liquor is to be abandoned (even if she be a sūdra woman married to a brāhmaṇe ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 73 quotes a text (of Parāśara X. 26 and Vas. Dh. 8. 21. 15 ) that half of the body of him whose wife drinks surā is guilty of grave sin'904 (on Yaj III. 256 it is asoribed to Manu ). Vas. Dh. 8. ( 21.11 ) says that & brābmapa wife who drinks surā is not allowed by the gods to reach the world of her husband (after death ) and that she

wanders in this world as a leech in water or as an oyster. 1805 Yāj. III. 256 says the same and adds that such a wife becomes in her subsequent lives a bitch, a vulture or a pig in this world itself, 

Visvarūpa (on Yaj. I. 140 ) quotes a text that a vendor of liquors is to have a flagstaff at his shop to indicate that it is a liquor shop, that his shop was to be in the midst of the village and that he was not to sell sura to the antyajas except in times of distress ( 1. e, in diseases &o.).1908 

Megasthenes ( p. 69 ) and Strabo (XV. 1. 53 ) note that Indians did not drink wine except at sacrifices ( in the 4th century B. C.). Gautama 23.1. Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III. 253 prescribe that if a person knowingly and frequently drinks sur. i. e. paiştı, he can be purified only by death due to the pouring in his mouth of boiling surā or water or ghee or cow's urine or milk. Yāj. III. 254 prescribes another prayasoitta (expiation ) also. Vas. Dh. . 20. 19, Manu XI, 146 and Yāj. III. 255 prescribe that if any one of the three varnas drinks surā through ignorance he becomes pure by undergoing the penance of Kșcobra and by having his upangyang performed again. Aparārka (p. 1070 ) quotes & smsti of Kumārs that a child up to five years has to perform no penance for drinking any intoxioant, that after five but before upanayapa the child's parents or other relative or friend has to undergo it viz. three krochras. 1907 

Manu (VII. 47-52) enumerates in the case of kings ten vices springing from love of pleasure and eight vioes produced by wrath and then states that among vices due to love of pleasure drinking, dice, women and hunting are the worst and that drinking is the most pernicious of all the vices of kings. Kautilya VIII. 3 agrees with this. Gaut. XII. 38 and Yāj. II. 47 declare that though sons and grandsons are bound to repay their ancestors' debt as a pious duty, they are not bound to pay

debts inourred for liquors, gambling &c. Among the articles that a brāhmaṇa is forbidden to sell even when he is forced to take to trade as a means of livelihood is liquor (Manu X. 89 and Yāj. III. 37). 

To return to the subject of bhojana. After finishing one's midday meal, a person was to chew tāmbula or mukhavasa ( des cribed above p. 734) and it appears that in ancient times persons smoked also certain preparations made with fragrant berbs and medicaments (and not tobacco which was then unknown). For example, Bāņa describes in the Kādambari ( para 15 ) that king Sādraka after bis mid-day meal took in the smoke of fragrant drugs and then chewed tāmbūla. 1908 In the Caraka-sanhita, sūtra sthāna chap.5, there is a description how & reed was to be smeared with pastes of sandalwood, nutmeg, cardamom and several other drugs and spices, how it was to be eigbt angulas long and as thick as one's thumb, how it was to be dried and the reed removed and then the dried portion was to be smoked. Vide Indian Antiquary vol. 40 pp. 37-40 for detailed information. 

The Visnupurana III. 11. 94 remarks that after taking the mid-day meal one may do acts that would not cause exertion to the body. Dakşa ( II. 68-69 ) says that after109 taking dinner one should sit at ease and allow the food to be digested and should read and listen to itihāsa and purānas in the 6th and 7th parts of the day, and in the 8th part of the day the bouseholder should look into his private worldly affairs and then perform the evening adoration (eandhyā) outside the house.

is said in the Harşacarita (III) to have listened after the midday meal to the recitation of the Vayupurāņa by the reader Sudrsti. Yaj. ( I. 113-114) directs that the rest of the day (till evening) should be spent in the company of ģistas (learned and respecta ble people) and of dear relatives and then having performed the evening prayer and offered oblations into the three sacred fires (if he has kept the three Vedic fires) or into gļhya fire, the householder sbould feed guests if they come at night, then he should take his evening meal surrounded by (bis children) and servants, should not eat too much in the evening and then go to sleep. Daksa ( II. 70-71 ) says that after evening he should perform homa, then take his meal, do other household work, then repeat some part of his Veda and sleep for two watches (six hours) and he should devote some time in the first and last watches of the night to reciting the Veda already learnt. 

Numerous rules are laid down in the smrtis and digests about sleeping, viz. as to the position of the head, what kind of bed to use, where to sleep and what texts to recite and so on Vide Gaut. II. 13 and IX. 60, Manu IV, 57, 175-176, Yāj. I. 136, Vişnupurāņa III. 11. 107-109 for some of these rules. Among the earliest works to give elaborate rules is the Vişnu Dh. S. chap. 70, which is set out here. 'One should not sleep when one's feet are wet with water, nor should one have his head towards the north and west or lower (than the other parts of the body ), nor should one sleep naked por below a beam along its length nor in an uncovered place nor on a bed-stead of & palāsa tree nor on one made of five kinds 1911 of wood nor on one made of trees split by an elephant nor on one made of wood burnt by lightning, nor on a broken bed-stead nor on one which is scorched, nor on a bed of trees watered with jars, nor in cemeteries nor in an unoccupied house, nor in a temple, nor in the midst of rash (or mischievous) persons, nor in the midst of women, nor above grain, nor in a stable of cows nor on the bed-stead of elderly persons nor over a fire or over an idol, nor before washing his hands or lips after meals, nor should one sleep by day nor in the twilight nor on ashes, nor on an unclean spot, nor on a wet spot nor on the top of a mountain.'

One should bow to one's favourite deity and keep a bamboo staff near one's bed8ys the Smộtyarthasāra. The Smộtiratna says that one should not sleep on the same bed with a person suffering from an eye dis ease or with one who is an epileptic or with one suffering from foyer, leprosy, tuberculosis, asthma and hiccough. The Ratnāvali (quoted in Sm. M. abnika p. 457) requires that one should place & jar full of water at the head of the bed-stead, recite Vedio mantras for one's protection and mantras against poison and also the hymn to Night (Rg. X. 127), remember the five ancient personages well-known as sound sleepers, '918 viz. Agasti, Mādbava, Mucakunda, Kapila and Astrka, salute Vişnu and then go to sleep. Harita (prose) quoted in Ābnikaprakāśa p. 557 oontains similar rules. Vțddha-Hārita (VIII. 309-310) says that an ascetic, a brahmacārl, a forest hermit and a widow should not sleep on a cot but on the ground covered over with a deer skin or a blanket or with kušas. 

In connection with the subject of going to bed at night, a good deal is stated in the smrtis and digests about sexual inter course between husband and wife. Some of these rules ( viz. about the proper days for intercourse) have already been stated above (pp. 204-205). Gaut. V.1-2 and IX. 28-29, Ap. Dh.S. II.1.1, 16–23 lay down that a householder is to approach his wife on the proper days or he may do so at any time except on forbidden days or when the wife desires it; he is not to bave intercourse during day-time or when the wife is ill, nor when she is in her courses nor should he embrace her during that period, Ap. Dh, S. II. 1. 1. 19, Vas.'1% Db. S. XII. 24 and Yaj. I. 81 refer to the boon conferred on women by Indra scoording to a legend narrated in the Tal. 8. II. 5. 1.

S. chap. 69 puts all rules together, some of which are: A householder must avoid sexual intercourse after having been invited at a grāddha or having partaken of dinner at it or after having given a & grāddba dinner or after performing the initiatory ceremony of soma sacrifice; he must not have intercourse in a temple, in a cemetery, in an empty house or at the root of a tree, in the day time 18 or at twilight, or with a woman older than himself or with a pregnant woman or with one who has a limb too much or is deficient in a limb. Vide Visņupurāņa III. 11. 110-123 for similar rules on the same topic. Most of the rules are eugenic or based on hygiene, though a few may be held to be only religious or superstitious. Gaut. IX. 26, Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 1. 21-23 and II. 1. %. 1, Manu IV. 4 and V, 144 say that after intercourse the husband and wife should take a bath or at least wash, sip water and sprinkle water over the body and should sleep on separate beds.

towards her. In the Tai, S. II. 5. 1. it is stated 1917 'One should not address a woman who has unolean clothes (i. e. who is in her course) nor should one sit with her, one should not eat her food for she keeps emitting the colour of brāhmaṇa murder; they say woman's food is unguent, therefore one should not accept unguent from her; but anything else at will may be accepted'. The Tai. Br. III. 7. 1 states 'Indeed half of this sacrifice is destroyed in the case of him whose wife becomes un. touchable on the day on which the observances for & sacrifice commence (i. e. on the day previous to the performance); but the sacrificer should segregate her (in a different place or house) and offer the sacrifice; by so doing he worships with a sacrifice that is entire (though the wife is absent)."1918 The adhikarana in Jaimini (III. 4. 18-19) is based on these texts; Sabara's bhāşya quotes the passage of the Tai. S. and of the Tai. Br. and the conclusion established is that these rules, though occurring in the context of the new moon and full moon sacrifices, are not restricted to those sacrifices, but are to be observed by per sons generally (i. e. they are puruşārtha and not kratvartha). The Tai. S. II. 5.1 contains thirteen directions about a rajasvalā and deolares what evil results follow from breaches of them. They are: there is to be no intercourse with her, nor in a forest (after she bathes), nor when she is unwilling (after bath ), she should not bathe during the three days, should not bathe with oil in those days, should not arrange her hair with a comb, should not apply collyrium to her eyes, should not brush her teeth, should not pare her nails, should not spin yarn, should not make ropes, should not drink water with a vessel made of palāsa leaves or & vessel that is baked in fire (or is broken). The results of the breaches are respectively that the son ( born of her) becomes suspected or charged with grave sins, a thief, shy and not bold, destined to die in water, has a skin disease,

has a bald head and is feeble, is squint-eyed, has dark teeth, has bad nails, is impotent, is unrestrained (or commits suicide by hanging), becomes a lunatio, or a dwarf. The Tai. S. further direots that she should observe these rules for three nigbta, should drink water with her hands joined together or with a plate that is not baked in fire. The Bṛ, Up. VI. 4. 13 notes that a married woman in her courses should drink water from & vessel of bronze and should not wash her olothes, a südra male or female should not touch her; on the lapse of three nights she should bathe and she should be made to unhusk rice. Many of the gūtras refer to the rules contained in the Tai, S. about the rajasvala (vide Ap. gp. 8. 12,1919 Hir. gs. I. 24. 7, Bhar. gļ. I. 20, Baud. gr. I. 7. 22-36, Baud. Dh. S. 1. 5. 139 ). Vas. Dh. S. V. 7-9 con tains the story of Indra and the boon given to women and also the rules about rajasvalā (adding that she should sleep on the ground, should not sleep by day, should not eat flesh, should not look at the planets, should not laugh). When Vas. Dh. 8. V. 8. and Vişņu Dh. 8. 51. 16 forbid the eating of the food of & rajasvali, what is meant is (according to the Gr. R. and other digests) that the food cooked for her or owned by her should not be eaten. Laghu-Harita 38 prescribes that a rajasvalā may eat food from her own band used as a plate; Vṛddba-Hārita (XI. 210-11) says the same and adds that if she be a widow, then she should not take food for three days and that one whose husband is living should have only one meal a day. Rajasvala women were also not to touch one another. Vişņu Dh. S. (22. 73-74) prescribes that if & rajasvala touches another rajasvalā of lower var & she should observe a fast from that time till the fourth day when she takes the purificatory bath; while if she touches another rajasvala woman of the same varpa or higher varna, she has to bathe and then take her food. More elaborate rules are laid down by Angiras 48 ( who proscribes pañcagavya), Atri 279-283, Ap. (verse) VIL. 20-22, Bșhad-Yana III. 64-68, Parāsara VII. 11-15. If & rajasvala is touched by a cāņdāla or by any of the antyajas, or by a dog or grow, she has to be without food till she bathes on the 4th day (Angiras 47, Atri 277-279, Apastamba VII. 5-8). If a woman is suffer ing from fever and becomes a rajasvala she is not to be bathed

on the 4th day to purify her; her purification is to be effected by another healthy woman, who touches her and then herself bathes with her clothes on and this is done te n or twelve times and each time there is sipping of water; then the woman who is ill has her clothes removed and new ones put on and then gifts are made according to ability and she becomes pure (Uganas quoted in Mit. on Yāj. III. 20). Similar verses occur in Angiras 22-23. The same procedure is followed where & male who is ill is touched by a rajasvalā or for some other cause he has to undergo the purification of a bath, viz. a healthy male touches him geven or ten times and bathes after each touob, at the end of whioh the sickly person is to be declared to be free from the impurity (Angiras 21, Parāśard VII, 19-20 quoted in Mit. on Yaj. III. 20). If a rajasvalā dies, then the corpse should be bathed with the five products of the cow (pancagavya), she should be covered with another garment and then should be cremated (& Verse quoted by the Mit, on Yāj. III. 20), while Angiras (42) said that the corpse should be bathed after three days and then it should be oromated. The Mit on Yāj. III. 20 notes that, if & woman who usually has monthly periods, men struates within seventeen days, then she has no impurity; if on the 18th, she becomes clean in one day, if on the 19th in two days and thereafter in three days. Vide Angiras 43, Apastamba (verse) VII. 2, Parāgara VII. 16-17. 

So far we have desoribed the daily duties of common men, particularly of brāhmanas. Manu VII. 145-147, 151-154, 216-226, Yaj. I. 327-333 and Kaut. I. 19 dilate upon the daily duties of the king. Kaut divides day and night into eight parts each and states that in the first part of the day the king should take measures for his protection and attend to income and expenditure, in the second he should look into the causes (or disputes ) of the people of the cities and villages, in the third he should bathe, study or recite the Veda and take his meals, in the fourth he should receive revenue in gold and appoint (or examine) superintendents; in the fifth he should correspond with the council of ministers, and receive the secret news brought by his spies; in the sixth he may engage in what ever amusements or sports he likes or in deliberation (on state matters); in the seventh he should review elephants, horses, chariots and soldiers; in the eighth he should consider with the help of his commander-in-chief plans of campaigns. When the day ends he should observe the evening prayer; in the first part

of the night, he should see secret emissaries, in the second part of the night he may bathe, revise his studies and take supper; in the third he should lie down after the burst of trumpets and sleep in the fourth and fifth; in the 6th he should be awakened by the sound of trumpets, he should bring to his mind the dictates of sāstra and the mode of carrying them out; in the seventh he should deliberate and send out secret omissaries; in the eighth he should receive, being accompanied by his sacrifi. cial priests, acārya and purohita, benedictions and should see his physioian, chief cook and astrologer and having circumambu. lated a cow with her calf and a bull he should go to court. Or the king may divide the parts of day time and night time according to his capacity. Other smộtikāras differed here and there. Katyāyana prescribed 1920 that the king should devote the three parts of the day time (divided into eight) after the first part to judicial work and if he cannot personally do it, he should appoint & judge. Yāj. (I. 327-333) mostly follows (though concisely ) the routine sketched by Kaut. The Manusmrti also hardly adds anything of importance to what we find in Kaut. It is remarkable that in the Dasakumāra-oarita (ucchrāsa VIII) the author closely following the words of Kautilya as to the engagements of the king during the eight parts of daytime and of night also puts in the mouth of the voluptuous jester Vibārabhadra & parody of Kautilya's solemn dicta. 1921 

As to the ahnika of vaisyas and sūdras no special rules are laid down in the smrtis. They had to adjust the duties set out for brāhmaṇas to their own case according to their circumstances. A vaisya belonged to the twice-born classes and he could do if he chose almost every thing that a brāhmana could (except officiating as a priest or teaching as a profession or receiving gifts ). Vide pp. 154-164 for the disabilities and the few privileges of the sūdra,

ning (upakran Asv. g!. III. 3:in the year. Ap. 

Upākarma or Upākarana means 'opening, starting or begin. ning' (upakrama as the Mit. on Yāj. I, 142 says) and Utsarjana or Utsarga (in Aśv. gļ, III. 5. 13) means 'the cessation of Vedio studies for a certain period in the year.' Ap. gr. VIII. 1 and Ap. Dh S. I. 3. 11. % employ the word 'samāpana' for utsarjana. In former times these two rites were performed on different dates and in different months, but with the decline of vedio studies in medieval times they came to be performed one after another on the same day. In several sātras the first of these two is spoken of as adhyayopākarspa (as in Āśv. gr. III. 5. 1.) or adhyiyopākarma (in Pār. gs. II. 10, Vas. Dh. S. 13. 1). In this case adhyāya means study of the Veda' or it may mean Veda itself because it is studied (pre-eminently). Therefore the rite which signalises the opening of the session for Vedic study in the year is itself called upākarma.1997 In Gaut. 16. I the rite of upākarmu is called vārșika either because it took place in varsā (the rainy season) or because it took place once a year (from varsa, a year). The Āśv. gr. III. 5. 19 also states that this rite is oalled vārşika. 

The time for upakarma is variously stated in the sātras, The Āśv. gr. III. 5. 2-3 states when the herbs appear, when the moon is in conjunction with the constellation of Sravana, in the month of Srāvaņa or on the 5th (tithi) of Srāvang when the moon is in the Hasta nakşatra. "1913 The

Pār. gr. II. 10 says 'when the herbs appear, when the moon is in conjunction with Sravana on the full moon day in the month of Srāvana or on the fifth of the month of Srāvans when the moon is in Hasta.' Gaut. 16. 1 and Vas. Dh. 8. 13. 1 require that it should be performed on the full moon day of Srivana or Bhadrapada. The Khādira gf. (III. 2. 14-15) and Gobhila III. 3. 1 and 13 ordain that Upakarma should be performed on the full moon day of Bhadrapada or under the constellation of Hasta in that month or according to some on the full moon day of Srāvana. The Baud. gr. III. 1. % prescribes that Upakarma may be done on the full moon day of Śrāvana or Aşadha. The Hir. gr. (II. 18. 2, S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 241) says 'during the fortnight (at the end of which) the full moon of Srāvana ocours, when the herbs have sprouted forth, the ceremony for the open ing of the annual Veda study ( should be performed ) under the Hasta oonstellation or on the full moon day'. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 3.9.1 speaks only of the full moon day of Srāvans as the time for the performance of the Upakarma rite. Manu. IV. 95 prescribes the full moon of Sravana or Bhadrapada as the time for upākarma. Yaj. I. 142 provides three times viz. on the full moon day of Srivaņa or on a day (in Srāvapa).when the moon is in conjunction with the Sravana nakşatra or on the 5th tithi of Śrāvaņa if the moon is in conjunction with Hasta. The Kūrmapurāņa (Uttarārdha 14. 60-61 ) holds that Upakarma should be performed on the full moon day of either Srāvana, Āşādha or Bradrapada. In this rather bewildering variety of opinions oommentators like the Mit. prescribed that one should follow one's gphyasutra.'°* This means ( as stated by Medhatithi on Manu IV.95 ) that the full moon of Bhadrapada being mentioned by Gobhila gr. and Khādira gł. Chandogas (students of the Sāmaveda ) should perform upakarma on that day; but as Ap. Dh. 8. speaks only of the full moon of Srāvana, the followers of the Krsna Yajurveda should perform upakarma only that day. When there is no rain and so no herbs appear in Srāvapa or when that day is inauspicious owing to an eclipse or the like, Upakarma may be performed on the full moon day of Bhadrapada by those whose grhys aŭtra allows

the option of two months or on the fifth of the bright half of Śrāvana. But if both days of the full moon in the two months are inauspicious, then Upākarma should be performed on the full moon of Srāvana. As the Baud. gr. refers to the full moon of Aşādha, the followers of the Black Yajurveda may perform upākarma on Āsādha full moon, if the full moon of Srāvana is not available. But the students of the Rgveda cannot do so, since no sutra of the Rgveda speaks of Asādha 88 an optional month. Rgvedins have to prefer Sravana bakşatra (so that they may perform upakarma on the 14th or 15th of the bright half of Srāvana ); the followers of the Yajurveda (Sukla ) must perform it on the full moon day of Śrāvana when the moon is in Śravana nakşatra, but if the moon is not so, then they have to prefer the full moon day. The students of the Taittiriya gākhā also have to follow this last course. The followers of the Sāmaveda should prefer Hasta. Vide Sam. Pr. pp. 497-498, Sm. M. pp. 32-33, Nirn, pp. 114-120. Some interpreted Yaj. I. 142 in such a way as to yield four times for upākarma, viz. the full moon of Srāvana, the day in Srāvana on which the moon is in conjunction with Sravana nakşatra ( this may sometimes be the 14th tithi of the bright half ), or on the 15th of the bright half of Śrāvana or on that day in Srāvana when the moon is in Hasta. Why so much importance was attached to the month of Srāvana and to the constellation of Sravans as the season for starting Veda study is obscure. It is possible that that month was originally chosen as owing to showers of rain it is pleasantly cool, there is more leisure and staying inside the house in that month for brāhmaṇas than in other months of the year and then Nature is at its best. The month of Srāvaņa being fixed upon, the best day therein would be the full moon (Soma in another sense being the king of brābmaņas ). If any other day in Srāvana was to be chosen then the day on which the moon was in Hasta would be the best, which would ordinarily be the 5th of the bright half (of Srāvana). As the Paurņamāsí of that month was called Srāvani owing to the moon's conjunction with the Sravana naksatra ( which conjunc 

tion usually takes place on that day) the Sravana nakşatra came to be associated with the starting of the annual session of Vedio studies. But that the Sravana naksatra by itself bad no direct connection with upākarma is clear from the fact that several sūtras do not mention it at all. The Gobbila and Khādira gr. do not accept the full moon day of Srāvana ( but of Bhadrapada and the Hasta naksatra ) as the proper time for upakarma.

Oldenberg in his note on san, gr. IV. 5. % when the herbs appear, under the nakşatra Hasta or Sravana'( S. B. E. vol. 29, P. 112 ) remarks 'the naksatra Sravana is evidently considered 88 particularly fit for this occasion because of its name contain ing an allusion to śruti'. But this conjecture has no plausibi. lity. Hardly any ancient writer makes the suggestion that Sravana and Sruti are brought together on account of the root 'śru'. The presiding deity of Hasta is Savitr. Owing to the supreme importance given to the Gāyatri verse (of which Savity is the deity ) and to the fact that Veda study begins with the recitation of the Gayatri, the nakşatra Hasta would be closely connected with the starting of Veda study. As a matter of fact the San. gr. IV. 5.2 mentions Hasta first and then Śravana; the Hir. gg. does not name the Sravana naksatra at all, but names Hasta in this connection; while the Āśv. gr., Pār. gr. and several others mention both Sravana and Hasta. 

. are brought together as the suggestion that 

'śru'. The n 

Upākarma is to be done in the morning. If for part of the day, the moon is in conjunction with Uttarāşadhā and then with Sravana that day is not to be chosen for upākarma, but the next day is to be chosen on which the moon is in conjunction with Sravana and Dhanişthā. Later writers introduced further complications about the zodiacal sign (rāśi) in which the Sun would be at the time. Garga required that upākarma must be performed during the days when the Sun was in the sign of Leo by the followers of the Sāmaveda and by those who are to the north of the Narmada river. There is no upākarma in the intercalary month of Srāvana and Bhadrapada except for the followers of the Sāmaveda who must perform it in the inter calary month. When upākarma is to be done for the first time after a boy's upanayana, the planets Jupiter and Venus must not be in the position of asta ( i. e. invisibility owing to their being too near the sun). 

Upakarma is to be done by brahmacārins, by householders and also by vānaprasthas ( forest hermits). The teacher does it in the company of his pupils whether they be brahmacārins or not and performs the homa in his own gļhya fire, as the Pār. gr. II, 10 says. Karka the com. of Pār. gr. states that if the ācārya has no pupils then he has no adhikāra ( right or eligibi. lity ) to perform the upakarma in the gļhya fire, while Harihara says that the practice of performing upakarma in the ordinary

domestic fire in the company of a Veda student is based on no authority, but is a mere usage. 1935 

The procedure of upākarma is set out as followg1988 in the Aśv. gr. (III. 5. 4-12): 'having sacrificed the two ūjyabhāgas 1927 (portions of clarified butter), he should offer oblations of ajya to the following deities, viz. Savitri, Brahmā, Sraddhā, Medha, Prajāā, Dhāraņā (memory), Sadasaspati, Anumati, Chandases (metres) and Rşis (Bages). Then he sacrifices saktu (barley flour) mixed with ourds to the accompaniment of the following mantras; the one verse "I praise Agni, the purohita' (Rg. I. 1, 1),1948 and 'the Kuşumbhaka bas said it' (Rg. I. 191. 16), 'O bird, when crying announce welfare to us' (Rg. II. 43.3), *Sung by Jamadagni'(Rg. III. 62. 18), 'In thy abode the whole world rests' (Rg. IV.58, 11), 'you ( Maruts ) that deserve sacri fice, come to our sacrifice' (Rg. V. 87.9), 'whosoever whether ours or a stranger ( Rg. VI. 75, 19), 'look towards us, look in various directions' (Rg. VII. 101.25 ), 'Come here, O Agni, the friend of the Maruta' ( Rg. VIII, 103. 14), 'O king, the oblation that is cooked for thee' (Rg. IX. 114. 4).--each time two verses: the one verse one is our intention' (Rg. X. 191. 4); the one Verse we choose that blessing and boon.' When he is about to study the Veda he should, while the pupils (i. e. those who are to be taught the Veda) join him (lit. take hold of him), sacrifice

III. 62, 10 ) he should repeat thrice and then the beginning of the Rgveda (either one hymn or an anuvāka). 

In the other grbga sūtras there is a good deal of divergence as to the mantras, the deities and the materials offered as obla tions. Pār. gr. II. 10 says that the two ājya portions are offered and then oblations of ajya are to be made to the earth and fire if the Rgveda is to be studied, to the Airy region and to Vāyu if the Yajurveda, to the Heaven and the Sun if the Sāmaveda, to the quarters and the moon if the Atharveveda and oblations are also offered to Brahmā, to the Chandases (metres ) in all cases, and to Prajāpati, to the gods, to the Rşis, to Sraddbā, to Medhā, to Sadasaspati, to Anumati. Then Par. gr. (II. 10) proceeds "with the verse Sadaspatim' (Vāj. S, 32. 13=Rg. I. 18.6) the teacher three times sacrifices fried grains. All (pupils ) should repeat the verse after him. After each oblation they should each time put on the fire three pieces of udumbara wood that are fresh branches with leaves, anointed with ghee, reciting the Sāvitri. And the pupils should put on samidhs in the manner stated above ( Pār. gr. II. 4). With the verge Sam no bhavantu' (Vaj. 8. 9. 16 ) they should gulp down the fried grains without chewing them under the teeth. With the verso * dadbikrāvņo'(Vaj. S. 23. 32 ) they should eat ourds. What ever number of pupils he wishes to obtain so many sesamo

grains should the ācārya sacrifice by means of a dice board *** with the Savitri or with the anuvāka (Vaj. S. 17. 80-86). After they (the pupils ) have eaten (the remainder) the teacher should pronounce the word om and then repeat the Savitri three times and the beginnings of the adhyāyas to the students who are seated facing the east. All repeat "may it be ours in common; may it bless us in common; may this Brahman be powerful with us together. Indra knows that through which and in which no batred may spring up among us.” 

The Āp. gļ. (VIII. 1-2) is very brief and states that at the opening and conoluding rites of Vedic study that Rşi who is indicated as the Rși of the Kāņda ( section of the Tai. S.) to be studied is the deity to whom the rite belongs and in the second place Sadasaspati is the deity. Sudarśapācārya explains 1933 these two sūtras at great length. Briefly what he means is : the commencement (upākarma ) of the study of the whole Veda (Black Yajurveda) is to be done on the full moon day of Śrāvana, tarpana is to be done for nine Rşis and pine oblations of ūjya are to be offered to these nine, the ninth being offered with the verse 'sadagaspatim' (Rg. I. 18. 6 = Āp. M. P. I. 9,8). But when a Kānda is to be begun that is another upākarma and a homs is to be performed in respect of it also. 

Gradually many accretions were made to the simple upa karma rite given in the Āśv. gr. and other gļhya sūtras. In modern times upakarma is & most elaborate matter. That of Rgvedins may be briefly described here ; After acamana, prūpāyāma and reference to time and place, a sankalpa is made

Then the romaids of barley and curds are offered to Agni Sviştakst. Then the persons engaged in upākarma should partake of the remains of barley mixed with curds after repeating the verse * dadhikrāvạo '( Rg. IV. 39. 6). Then ūcamana and mārjana are performed, then homa of a yajñopavita in fire, then giving of yajopa vita and dakşiņās to brāhmapes and wearing new yajñopavita oneself ( which consists in its abhimantrana with the three verses 'āpo hi şthā' Rg.

and make others repeat om', vyāhrtis and Gāyatri thrice, then brahmayajña and then saying upākřtā vai vedāḥ' (the study of the Vedas has been begun), then the acārya finishes the rest of the rite such as prāyasoitta, then all resolve to feed brahmaņas and give dakşiņā according to ability. The ācārya takes leave of the fire, bows to Vişņu and sips water twice. 

The gļhyasūtrag prescribe a holiday (anadhyāya ) after the performance of upākarma, though the duration varieg. Par. gs. II. 10 prescribes that he should not study the Veda for three days and nights and should not clip his nails or shave for that period and points out that some said that he should not clip nails or hair till the date of utsarjana ( i. e. for 5 months and a half). Sān, gf. IV. 5. 17 (=Manu IV. 119) presoribes an anadhyāya ( holiday ) for three nights on upākarma and utsarga. Gobhila gr. (III. 3. 9 and 11 ) says that there is no study on the upākarma day performed on Hasta nakşatra and that according to some teachers for three days before it and after it. The Bhār. gr. III. 8 enjoins that after upakarma there should be a holiday of three days or one day and for one month thereafter one should not study the Veda in the evening (i. e, the first watch after sunset). 

Utsarjana:- About the time of utsarjana also there was divergence of view. The Baud. gr. (1.5.163 ) prescribes that it may be performed on the full moon day of Pauşe or Magha. Āśv.gr.(III.5.14) requires Veda study after upakarma for six months and so if the upākarma was performed on tbe new moon of Srāvana the utgarjana according to it would be on the full moon of Māgha ( vide III. 5. 20 also ). The Pār. gr. II. 11 states that after having studied the Veda for five months and a half or for six months and a half they (teacher and pupils ) should per form utsarga (1. e. the rite of closing the course of Vedic study). These periods are only approximate, since Pār. gs. II. 12 further on says that utsarjana should be performed in the month of Paupa when the moon is in the Rohiņi nakşatra ( i. e. about the eleventh of the bright half ) or in middle Aştakā (1. e. 8th of the dark half of Pausa ). The Gobhila gr. III. 3. 14 says that utsarga is performed on the full moon of Taisa ( i. e. Pausa ), while the Khadira gr. III. 2. 24 says that having studied the Veda for four months and a half they close the session on the full moon day of Pauşa, The Sān. gr. IV. 6. 1 holds that utsar jana should be performed on the first day of the bright half of Magha ; Yaj. I. 143 follows Pār. gr. II. 12 by saying that

816 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Ch. XXIII 

utsarga takes place in Pauşa on the Rohini naksatra or on the 8th of the dark half, while Manu ( IV, 95-96 ) says that after studying Veda for four months and a half from upākarma, utsarga should take place when the moon is in the Puşya naksatra thereafter or on the first day of the bright half of Māgha. The Mānava gr. I. 4.7 says that Veda study is stopped 41 or 5 or 5} months after upakarma. These several periods ( 4 months, or 51 months or 6 months ) and the various dates of utsarga in Pauşa or Māgha were due to the fact that upākarma may take place on the full moon day of Srāvana or Bhadrapada (or even Asadha) or on the 5th of the bright half of Srāvana or on Hasta in Bhadrapada or Srāyapa. 

The Aśv. gr. III. 5. 13 extends the procedure of upākarma to utsarga and adds (III. 5. 20-22) that offerings of boiled rice are made to the same deities instead of clarified butter, then they take a bath and perform tarpans of thoge very deities and of ācāryas, îşis and pit?s (as in brahmayajāa ). Nārāyana states that in utsarjana there is no eating (of barley late with ourds ) as there is in upākarma nor mārjana. Par. gr. II. 12 gives the procedure of utsarjana as follows: "They ( teacher and pupils ) should go to the brink of water ( a river &c.) and offer oblations of water ( i. e. tarpana ) to the gods, to the metres, to the Vedas, īsis, the ancient teachers, the Gandha. Ivas, the other teachers, the year with its divisions, the Pitrs, ācāryas, their ( deceased) relatives. After having rapidly recited the Sāvitri four times, they should utter loudly' we have stopped (Vedio study ).' There is anadhyāya in utsarjana for the same period as on upakarma and they should then continue the repeti. tion (of the Veda ) as before". The Gobhila gr. III. 3. 15 says about utsarjana 'they go out of the village turning their faces to the east or north, they should approach water that is deeper than their waist, should bathe therein and should offer tarpana to the vedas, ļşis and āoāryas.' A holiday was observed on the day of utsarjana for a day and half (pakşiņi) or three days after it (Manu IV. 97, Yāj. I. 144 ).

To give up Veda study for several months altogether was probably found undesirable. Therefore Manu IV. 98, Vas. Dh. S. 13. 6-7, Aušanasa (p. 515 ) and others prescribe that after utsarjana the Vedas should be studied till the next upakarma during the bright fortnights of the remaining months and the Vedāngas at one's will or in the dark fortnights. The Gobhila smrti III. 134 says that after Dakşiņāyana (sun's passage in the southern celestial hemisphere) for six months one should not study tbe Upanişads and Rahasya texts. It appears that gradually the rite of utsarga in Pauşe or Māgha came to be discontinued. Astāvakra 1937 on Mānavagshya I. 5. 1 deplores that in his day hardly any one was found to celebrate utsarga on the day specified by the sūtrakāra, that he was powerless to do anything or to upbraid any one but that he would only describe what the sastra prescribed. Similarly the Smrtyarthasāra, after describing the procedure of utsarjana, remarks (p. 11 ) *after studying the Veds for a year utsarjana may be performed on the day of upākarma or may not be so performed'. Gobhila-Smrti (III. 128-129, quoted in Sm. C. I p. 55 ) says 'when dvijas perform every year upākarma together with utaarjana according to the prescribed procedure, that results in the growth of the Vedas (Vedic study ). Whatever act is performed even in sport by brāhinaņas whose vedas have not grown stale, that act becomes successful.' Vide Sān. gr. IV. 5. 16 to the same effect. It is on account of this idea that in the sankalpa the expression 'yāta. yāmatānirāsena' (by removing staleness ) occurs. In modern times utsarjana is performed on the same day as upākarma, but precedes the latter. These two together being generally per formed in Srāvana either on the full moon or on Sravana naksatra or on the 5th of the bright balf of Srāvans are designated by the word Šrāvanl. 

The modern utsarjana of Rgvedins may be briefly described here : after acamana, putting on a pavitra ( & loop or ring ) of darbhas (on the finger called anāmikā), prāņāyāma, mentioning the time and place, & sankalpa ( as set out above) is made ; then pañoagavya is taken in by all; then the worship of Ganapati, then preparation of an altar for utsarjana homa is made, fire is invited with the verses justo damūnā'(Rg. V. 4. 5) and 'ehyagna' (Rg. I.

CHAPTER XXIV 

MINOR GRHYA AND OTHER RITES 

The grhyasūtras speak of certain other rites performed on certain fixed days in the year. Most of them have ceased to be performed in modern times, though vestiges of some of them appear even now. Gautama (VIII. 19 ) enumerates the seven pākayajā asamsthās among his forty sarskāras. Out of these seven pākayajñas, aştakā, pārvana and śrāddha will be dealt with under śrāddha later on, The seven haviryajñas and the seven somasamsthās will be treated of in the note on Srauta. A fow of the other rites are briefly described below. 

Pārvana sthalipāka:-Among the seven pākayājñasamsthās mentioned by Gaut. (VIII.19) is the pārvang sthālipaka. When a person is married and returns to his house after marriage he causes the newly married bride to sacrifice & mess of cooked food. The wife husks the rice grains of which that sthalipāka is prepared. She cooks the mess, sprinkles ajya on it, takes it from the fire. Then he sacrifices to the deities of the Vedic Darsa-Pūrpamāsa and then to Agni Svistakrt. With the remnants of the cooked food he feeds a learned brāhmana and makes the present of a bull to that brābmana. From that time the householder constantly saorifices on the days of the full moon and of the new moon & similar mess of cooked food sacred to Agni. In the case of one who has not kindled the three Vedic fires, the sthalipāka is meant for Agni (it is Āgnoya). In the case of an householder who keeps the three Vedic fires the sthallpāka at Full moon is Agnisomniya and Aindra or Mahendra or Aindrāgna on the New moon day ( Khādira gr. II. %. 1-3, Ašv. Śr. I. 3. 8-12). Both the householder and his wife fast on the days of the full and new moon or they eat only 

once in the morning on those days (Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 1. 4-5, Aøv. g$. I. 10. 2). This is briefly the pārvaņa sthalipāka. It is begun on the first full moon day after marriage and is conti. nued throughout the lives of the husband and wife. In the sthalipākas performed throughout life on the full moon and new moon there is no dakşiņā ( of a bull). 1838 Vide for details

Caitri :. According to Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 19 the caitri rite is the same as sūlagava, known as Išanabali to the students of the Apastamba sūtra (Ap. gr. 19, 13 ff.) and this rite called Caitrl was performed on the full moon day of the month of Caitra. In the Sān. gr. IV. 19 it is said that this rite takes place on the full moon day of Caitra and there is a brief des cription of it which is rather obscure ( vide S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 132 ). The Vaik. IV. 8 describes it as follows: On the full moon day of Caitra the house is cleaned and decorated ; the husband and wife deck themselves in new garments ( lower and upper) and with flowers etc.; after two āghāras 1940 are made in fire and rice is cooked in a vessel for the deities, offerings are made of clarified butter, with the mantras 'grismo hemanta' (Tai. S. V.7. 2. 4 ) 'ūrņam me püryatām,' 'sriye jātaḥ'( Rg. IX. 94. 4 ),' Vaisnavam' (Tai, S. I. 2, 13, 3 ) and having offered oblations of boiled rice mixed with ghee to Madhu, 1941 Madhava, Sukra, Suci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, Urja, Sabas, Sahasya, Tapas, Tapasya, to the deities of Rtus, to herbs, to the lords of herbs, to Sri ( goddess of wealth), to the lord of Sri, to Visņu ; having worshipped to the west of the fire the goddess Srl and the god Sripati whose face is turned eastwarde, he announces the havis (sacrificial food ) and having served to the recitation of the bymn to anna ( food ) the brāhmaṇas with cooked cuitrya food he should himself eat in the company of his sapiņdas. 

Sitāyajña ( sacrifice to ploughed land) - In the Gobbila gr. IV. 4. 27 there1848 is a brief desoription of the sacrifice performed at the time of ploughing by one who kept the smārta or aupasana fire: 'on an auspioious constellation he should cook & mess of sacrificial food and should offer oblations to the following deities, viz. Indra, Maruts, Parjanya (rains), Ašani ( thunder bolt ), Bbaga. And he should also offer (olarified butter ) to Sita, Ašā, Aradā, Anaghā.' In Pār. gr. II. 17 this rite is des

oribed in greater detail. But for want of space it is not set out here. The Pār. gr. in II. 13 speaks of a different rite to be performed at the time of taking out the plough and using it for ploughing. 

Śrāvaņi or Śravaņākarma and Sarpabali :--Ašv. gr. II. 1.1-15, Pār. gp. II. 14, Gobhila gr. III. 7. 1-23, Sān. gß.IV. 15, Bhār. gr. II. 1, Ap. gr. 18, 5-12 and others describe these two rites which are performed on the full moon day of Srāvana, wbether the moon be in conjunction with the constellation of Sravana or not. Ašv. gr, describes it as follows: 1943 "Having filled a new jar with the flour of unbroken grains of barley he places it on a new sikya ( an arrangement of strings for holding pots etc.) along with & spoon for making offerings (bali). Having got ready fried barley grains he smears 1944 half of them with clarified butter. At sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food and & cake on one potsherd and offers oblations (of cooked food) with the four verses 'O Agnil lead us to wealth by a good path &c.' ( Rg. I. 189. 1-4 ) verse by verse and offers with one band the cake prepared on one potsherd with the mantra 'to the constant one, the Earth demon, svābā." The cake should have been completely submerged in clarified butter or its top may be visible; with the verse - Agni, do not hand us over to ovil' (Rg.1.189.5) he sacrifices over the entire cake the clarified butter in which the cake had been submerged. Reciting the verse 'may the steeds bring bliss to us in our invocationa' ( Rg. VII. 38.7) he sacrifices into the fire the fried grains with his joined hands."945 He should give the other ( not smeared with olarified butter) fried grains to his people (sons &c.). Out of the jar he fills the spoon with barley flour, goes out of the house with his face towards the east, pours down water on a pure spot and offers sacrifice with the mantra to the divine 1946 hosts of snakes,

svaba' and makes an obeisance to them with joined hands in the words the serpents that are terrestrial,1947 that are aerial, that are celestial, that dwell in the several directions--to them I have brought this bali; to them I make ready this bali. Having gone round the bali with the right hand turned towards it, he sits down to the west of the bali (and recites the mantra ) * thou art & serpent; thou art the lord of serpents that creep ; by food thou protectest men and by a cake the serpents, by sacrifice the gods, me who am in thee (i. e. who seek thy favour and protection ) may not the serpents who also are in thee do any harm; I give over the Dhruva ( spoon) to thee.' Then with the words ' O firm one, I give over this one, this one to thee' he gives his people (son, unmarried daughter, wife) one by one. With the words ' O firm one, I give myself over to thee' he gives himself over at the end. Let no one pass between the sacrificer (and the bali) up till the rite of giving in charge ( paridana ). 1948 'To the divine hosts of serpents svāha '-with these words let him offer & bali in the evening and in the morning till Pratyavarobaņa. Some count the days till Pratyavarohana 1949 (from Srāvana full moon ) and offer the same number of balis on that very day (on which the śravaņā rite takes place)." The San. gr. IV. 15 has a similar ceremony called Sravaņākarma; however it practically con tains nothing beyond rules about the bali to serpents and it is worthy of note that some of the 16 upacāras associated with honouring a guest and with devapūjā are employed ( in it and in Ap. gr. &c.) for honouring the serpents viz. Offering a comb, unguents, flowers, thread ( vastra), collyrium, mirror. The Pār. gr. II. 14 is more elaborate as to sarpabali and the deities to whom the oblations of cooked food are offered are. Visnu, Sravana (naksatra), the Full moon day of Srāvana and the rainy season.' In Par. gr. also, & comb, ointment, collyrium, garlands are offered to the serpents. Ap. gr. 18. 5-12, Hir. gr.

Bhār. gr. II. 1, Baud. gr. III. 10, Mānava gr. II. 16 and others contain similar elaborate rules about sarpabali, the Hir. gr. and Ap. gr. requiring that the flowers used should be of the kimśula tree. It appears that when the husband was absent the wife was to offer the bali during the four months. The Mānava gr. II. 16.6 adds that even the südra wife of a brāhmaṇa abould silently offer the bali after washing her hands. Vide Sān. gr. IV. 15. 20 also for the wife doing it silently. 

Serpent worship arose from the fears entertained about the deadly effects of snake bites. The serpent cult is very ancient as the quotation from the Tai. S. cited above shows. Vide also Atharvaveda VIII.7.23 and XI. 9.16 and 24. In the Atharvaveda (VIII. 14.14-16) the well known names of some mythical serpents viz. Takşaka, Dhstarāstra and Airāvata oocur. The dangers from snakes must have intensified in the rainy season when serpents sought shelter in human babitations owing to vast areas being flooded and in search of their prey, viz. mice and frogs &c. Therefore the rite of offering & bali to serpents was performed on the full moon day of Srāvana and a bali was offered every day to serpents for four months till the full moon of Mārgasirşa on which day took place the Pratyavarobaņa (re-descent) i. e. discarding the use of cots for sleeping on and using the ground for that purpose. Fergusson in his famous work Tree and Serpent worship' (1868) traces serpent worship in the nations of antiquity, such as in Egypt, Judes, Greece &c. In the Mahabbārata nāgas figure very frequently. Vide Ādi. 35 and 123. 71, Udyoga 103, 9-16; Anusāsana 150. 41 (where the names of seven nāgas that support the earth such as Vāsuki, Ananta &c. are specified). In Anušāsana 14. 55 Siva is said to have snakes on his body like yajñopavīta. The purāņas are full of the stories of nāgas. Serpent worship continues to this day partioularly in South India, but now serpents are worship ped on the 5th of the bright half of Srāvana instead of on the full moon day of Srāvana as in the times of the sūtras. This day is now called Nagapancami and some account of it will be given later on under vratas. India possesses more varieties of serpents tban any single country in the world and the toll of life taken by snake bites is very heavy as compared with any other country. 

In certain medieval digests like the Samgkāra-kaustubha (p. 122) a rite called Nāgabali is described. It is performed on Sinivall(& day on which the moon is seen, but there is amāvāsya

thereafter) or full moon day or on the 5th or on the 9th when the moon is in Aśleşā (of which serpents are the presiding deity). Its object is two-fold viz. to expiate the sin of having killed & snake or snakes and to remove the obstacle to progeny ( supposed to arise from the wrath of serpents killed by a person). In this & figure of a serpent is made of the flour of rice or wheat or sesame which is then placed in a sûrpa (winnowing basket), then it is worshipped with the 16 upacāras (described above ) and a bali of pāyaga (rice-milk) is offered to it; then after washing the hands and feet and sipping water & homa is performed with ordinary fire (but there is no svistakrt offering); an oblation of clarified butter is offered with om and all the three vyābštis into the mouth of the serpent figure and the rest of the ūjya is sprinkled on its body, the serpent is praised with the mantras quoted above from Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3 and certain Purāna verses are repeated and the figure is thrown into the fire; then impurity (āsauca) is observed by the sacrificer and his wife for three days or one day; then eight brāhmaṇas are invited, they are supposed to stand in the place of the burnt effigy and upacāras are offered to them, they are fed and gifts are given to them; then a golden image of & serpent is put into the kalasa (water-pot ) and prayer is offered to it, and the golden image or its value or a cow is gifted to a brāhmaṇa. 

The Pār. gr. (II. 15) describes a rite called Indrayajāa on the full moon day of Proşthapada ( i. e. Bhadrapada ). It is briefly as follows: Having cooked pāyasa (rice cooked in milk) for Indra 1950 and cakes and having placed ( four ) cakes round the fire, and having offered the two ājyabhāgas he offers the milk rice to Indra; he offers the ājya oblations to Indra, Indrāni ( Indra's wife), Aja Ekapād, Abirbudhnya and to the Prosthapadās; he offers milk-rice to Indra ; after he has eaten ( a portion of the sacrificial food ) he offers a bali to the Maruts ; for Sruti says (Šat. Br. IV.5. 2. 16 ) 'the maruts are the eaters of ahuta ';195the bali ( to Maruts ) is offered on leaves of the

The Kausika sūtra ( 140 ) describes the procedure of a festival in honour of Indra for kings. It is begun on the eighth day in the bright half of Bhadrapada or Asvina in which a banner is raised on Sravana nakşatra. Yāj. I. 147 declares a holiday for one day on the day on which the banner in honour of Indra is raised and when it is taken down. Aparārka (p. 190 ) quotes Garga to the effect that the banner is raised by the king on the 12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in conjunction either with Uttarāşadhā, Sravana or Dhanişthā and adds that it is taken down on the Bharani nakşatra after the full moon day of Bhadrapada. The Krtya ratnākara ( pp. 292-93 ) adds that during the days of the festival worship is offered to figures of Indra and his wife Saci and son Jayanta made from pieces of sugarcane stalks and that it is not raised on Saturday or Tuesday or in periods of impurity due to birth or mourning or in portents like an earth-quake.

Indramaha ) was started by Uparicara Vasu. It is stated there in that when that king was prevailed upon by Indrs to desist from being a hermit in a forest and to rule over the country called Cedi, Indra gave him a bamboo staff as an affectionate gift and in honour of Indra the king planted it in the earth and since that time when the year ended a bamboo staff was raised by kings (and also other humbler persons ) and next day it was decked with baskets full of fragrant substances and ornaments, and garlands were suspended from it. It is possible that the raising of a bamboo staff on the first day of Caitre every year in the Decoan and other places is reminiscent of this ancient festival in honour of Indra. The Bțbateamhita (chap. 43) describes the origin of the Indramaha festival and devotes over sixty verses to the elucidation of the method of celebrating it. Vişnu gave to Indra & flag-staff to frighten asuras; in verse 8 it refers to Uparioara Vasu as the originator of the Indra festival, states on what auspicious conjunctions & carpenter and an astrologer should go to a forest and gives directions as to the tree to be selected ( Arjuna tree being the best ); then the tree is to be felled the next day and brought to the capital by the king on the eighth of the bright half of Bhradra pada with a retinue of citizens, ministers and brābmanas; the oity should be decorated with fine patakas ( flags ) and toranas (festival arches ); on the 11th there was to be a vigil, the trunk of the tree should be pared and chiselled and it should be placed on a yantra ( a mechanioal contrivance to raise it up), homa is to be offered; then it is to be raised up erect on the 12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in Sravana nakşatra or even without that being so; five or seven wooden figures (called sakrakumaris ) are also to be placed noar it ( to enhanoe the charm of the staff) and two smaller staffs (one and the other of the length of the principal staff) are also to be raised called Nanda and Upananda ; another staff also is to be raised as Indra's mother; the staff was to be deoked with several ornaments, baskets were to be hung round the staff, each one above the other and smaller in size, on the 4th day (from 12th tithi) verses in praise are to be recited and on the 5th day ( from the 12th i. e. on 1st of the dark half ) the staff is to be bidden farewell to.

The Asv. gs. II. 2. 1-3 describes 194 the rite as follows: 'on the full moon day of Āśvayuja (i, e. Ašvina ) the Aśrayuji rite (is performed ). Having adorned the house, baving bathed and put on clean ( White ) garments, they should take out a mess of oooked food for Pasupati and should offer it with the formula 'to Pasupati, to Sive, to Samkara, to Prşātaka, svāba." He should sacrifice with his joined bands & mixture of milk and clarified butter with the formula 'may what is deficient in me be made complete ( or full); may what is complete not deterion rate in me. To Prşataka, svābā.' 

The Sān. gr. (IV. 16 ) requires that in this rite oblations of olarified butter should be offered to Asvins, to the two stars of Aśrayuj nakşatra, to the full moon of Āśvina; to Sarad (autumn) and to Pasupati and the mixture of milk and ājya is offered with the hymn Rg. VI. 28 ( ā gavo agman) and that on that night the calves are allowed to join their mothers. Pār. gs. II. 16 calls this rite Prşātakāḥ, but it prescribes the cooking of pāyasa (milk-rice ) for Indra and offerings of that mixture with curds, honey and ghee are made to Indra, Indrāni, the Asvins, to the full moon of Asvina and Sarad (autumn). The Gobhila gr. III. 8. 1 also calls this rite Prşātaka and it adds the tying to the arms &o. of amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs for the sake of prosperity. Vide also Khādira g!. III. 3. 1-5, Vaik. IV.9 for this rite. 

In most of the grhyasūtras another rite called Agrayana is described immediately after Aśrayuji. Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 19 explains that in the Aśrayuji rite mentioned by Gaut. both the Asvayuji described above from Ašv. gr. and Agrayana are included. Agrayana is also called 'Navayajña' in Gobhila smrti ( in verse III. 103 ) and Navasasyeşti in Manu IV. 27.

Agrayana işti is prescribed in the Aøv, srauta sūtra II. 9 and other brauta sūtras for those who have consecrated the three vedio fires ( i.e. abitāgnis ). According to Nāra. yapa an āhitāgni is to perform this āgreyaņa sacrifice of fresh corn according to the frauta sūtra, but in case of difficulties he may do so in accordance with Asv. gr. II. 2. 4 in the Tretā fires and that one who has not conge orated the three fires may offer the sacrifice in the sala ( i. e. aupāgana ) fire. This āgrayana rite is required even by the srauta sūtra as to crops of rice, barley and syāmāka 1955 only and no one was to make use of fresh corn of these three kinds without offering this sacrifice, but there was no restriction as to the use of other kinds of corn or as to vege tables &c. The word Agrayana is explained as 1950 that rite in which fresh fruits are first offered to gode' or 'that rite in which fresh corn is first offered or eaten'. The deities of the srauta Agrayapa are three, viz. Indrāgni (or AgoIndrau), Visvedevas, Dyāyāprthivi (heaven and earth), but in the gphya Āgrayana, Agni Svistakst is added as the fourth (San. gf. III. 8. 1, Ap. gr. 19.7). Āśy. gr.

concise '( Now follows the description of) Agrayana for one who has not set up the srauta fires. Having prepared a mess of cooked food with fresh corn, he offers oblations to the deities of the (Srauta) Āgrayana with Sviştakệt ( Agni) as the fourth, he fills his mouth with grains of rice, swallows them, takes ācamana and having rolled up a lump of rice (from the mess of cooked rice) he throws it up on to the top of the dwelling with the next yajus (Ap. M. P. II. 18. 1).' 

This rite is also described in San, gļ. III. 8, Pār, gr. III. 1, Gobhlla gr. III. 8. 9-24, Khādira gr. III. 3. 6-15, Vaik. IV. 2, Mānava gr. II. 3. 9-14 &c. 

There is one peculiarity in Vaik. viz. that it connects the Pit?s also with this rite. According to Mānava gr. the Agra yana is porformed on a parva day in Vasanta (spring) with fresh barley that is (then) harvested and with rice in sarad (autumn). 

Vaik. VI. 19 prescribes the prāyascitta of pādakrcchra or a fast for using first fruits without performing Agrayaņa rite. 

In modern times some vestige of this Navayajña (saorifice of first fruits) still remains. The full moon day of Asyina is still called in the Deccan 'navyāci paurņimā' and a few ears of growing crops are picked up, are woven with flowers and tastefully arranged and the whole is suspended from the entrance door or its lintel. 

Agrahāyaṇī ---This is one of the seven pākayajñas men tioned by Gautama (VIII. 19 ) among his forty saņskāras. 

The full moon day of Mārgaśirşa is called Agrahāyani; the rite 1958 performed on that day is also called by the same name on account of association with it. Pratyavarohana is a rite performed to signalise the giving up of the use of cots and high couches, recommended from the full moon of Srāvana for fear of snakes (as in Sān. gr. IV. 15. 22). Some describe two rites separately, one on the full moon day of Mārgasirşa and another oalled Pratyavarohana on the first night of Hemanta (vide Ap. gr. 19.3-5 and 8-12). There is some divergence as to the time and the exact procedure of this rite. Some (like. Ašv. gr. II. 3.1-2) hold that it may be performed on the 14th day of the bright

half or the full moon day of Mārgasirsa. Others restriot it to the full moon day. Very elaborate descriptions are given in Pār. gp. III. 2, Gobbila gr. III. 9. 1-23. As this rite has entirely gone out of vogus a brief description from the Asy, gf. alone is appended 1989 here. “Having again (after Ašvaguji ) renovated the house with plaster (of paint or cow-dung) and by levelling ( the floor), they should offer after sunset oblations of pāyasa (milk-rice) with the mantras 'strike aside,'*60 O white one. with thy foot, with the front and back portions of the foot these seven women ( daughters ) of Varuna and all (females ) that belong to the tribes of the king ( of serpents ). Inside the house of the white one the serpent did not kill any thing, adoration to the white one, the son of Vidarva, svāha.' Here no oblation is offered to (Agni) Sviştakrt. While gazing fixedly at the fire he repeate in a low voice 'may there be no harm to us from the progeny 1901 of Prajāpati.' He should think in his mind of Hemanta (winter) saying 'be suspicious and well-disposed towards us.' To the west of the fire a well-spread layer of grass should be prepared; he should sit down on it and having recited in a low voice 'Be blissful, O Earth' (Rg. I. 22. 15 ) he should lie down on that layer with his people (sons &c.) with the head towards the east and face turned towards the north. The others may lie down according as space permits or each should lie down one after another, the elder one before the one next to him in years. Those (of the sacrificer's sons &o.) who know the mantras should murmur them (Rg. I. 22. 15 and the mantras referred to in sūtra 12 below). Getting up from the layer they should three times recite the mantra' from that place may the gods protect us '(Rg. I. 22. 16 ); the same verse ( they should repeat) a fourth time turning their faces to the south, to the west and the north.1968 Having gathered together they should

repeat in a low tone the mantras sacred to the sun and the Svastyayana 1883 mantras, cook food and feed the brāhmaṇas and make the latter pronounce suspicious words." In the Pāli work called Anguttara-nikāya there is & section called Paccoro. hanivagga in which the Pratyavarohana observed by brāhmaṇas is described. Vide Anguttara vol. V. ( ed. by Hardy ) p. 233 OXIX, and Z. D. M. G. vol. 52 pp. 149-151. 

Agrahāyani has been described also in Khādira gr. III. 3. 1-26, Gobhila gr. III. 9, Mānava gr. II. 7.1-5, Bhār. gr. II. %, Ap. gf. 19. 3-5, Kāthaka gļ. 60.1 ff., Kausika sūtra 24. 24-36 Hir. gļ. II. 17. 1 ( where Mātrdatta says that Agrahāyani is also styled Pratyavarohana). Baud. gp. II. 10 speaks of a rite called Pratyavarohana to be performed at the beginning of each of the six ftus (seasons) and the intercalary month (if any). 

This is a different rite. 

sulagava or Īsānabali - This was originally an offering of the flesh of an ox to Siva. There was some difference of opinion as to the time. Aģv. gr. IV. 9.2 states that it was to be perform ed in Sarad ( autumn ) or in Vasanta (spring) under the constel lation of Ardrā. The Baud. gr. II. 7. 1-3 says that every year it was to be performed on the full moon day of Mārgasirsa or on the Ardrā nakşatra 1964 in that month or whenever cattle suffer from some pest or disease. The Kathaka gr. (52,2-3) declares that the Sūlagave may be performed from various desires in śarad or vasanta and that according to some ācāryas there is no restriction as to season. The Bhār. gr. IL 8 and Hir. 87. II. 8. 2 say that it may be performed in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious nakşatra. 

Various explanations are given why this rite was called Salagava. Nārāyaṇalsts says Sūla here means one who has &

spit ( or pointed rod ) i. e. Siva who is called Sulin and that this sacrifice is offered to Rudra Śülin with the ox as a sacrificial animal. Haradatta explains that here the ox is marked with the rod ( of Siva ). 

This rite is most elaborately described in Asvi gr. IV. 9, Baud. gr. II. 7, Hir. gr. II. 8-9, Bhār. gr. II. 8-10, Pār. gr. III. 8. It appears that even in the times of the grhya sūtras there were many who did not like the rite of ox-flesh. The Baud. gr. (II. 7. 26–27) says196 that if a person cannot secure an ox he may sacrifice with a goat or ram or he may cook & mess of cooked food for Isāna and with that he does everything that is to be done by means of an ox. The commentator Devapāla on Kathaka 1967 gr. 52. 1 says that only a goat is offered and the bull is let off as the people are opposed to the idea of the sacrifice of an ox. 

As this rite has totally gone out of practice only a brief description of it from the Mānaya gļhya1988 ( which is the briefest of all on this rite ) is given here. 'Sulagava is to be performed in Sarad for ( propitiating ) Rudra. In the north-east of the village and not near it ( it is to be performed ) at night and there is to be a sacrificial post, not chiselled ( into an octagonal shape as in other sacrifices ), in the midst of oxen. Before the (final offering ) to Agni Sviştakrt (i.e. after perform ing the usual homa with boiled rice up to this point ) he should fill eight vessels made of leaves with blood and offer them in the principal quarters and the intermediate quarters with the eight anuvākas (Tai. S. IV.5.1 ff. and Vāj. S. 16th adhyāya ) beginning with 'adoration to thee, O Rudra, who are Manyu (wrath ).' He should not bring the uncooked offerings into the village. He should bury into the ground the rest ( of the animal offered ) and its skin also. Some cāryas say that in the pakayajñas in which animals are sacrificed there is no saori ficial post.'

Vüstu.pratişthā:-- construotion and occupation of a new house ). 

The Asv. gr. II. 7-9, ān. gr. III. 2-4, Pār. gr. III. 4, Ap. gr. 17. 1-13, Khādira gě. IV.2.6-22 and other gļhya works deal with the matter of building a new house. Ašv. gr. (II. 7) says that one who intends to build a house should first examine the ground, which must be non-salinous, which should have herbs and trees, much kuś& and viraņa grass growing on it; that one should dig out thorny plants and plants having milky juice with their roots and remove them and also certain other plants like apāmārga, tilvaka, etc. He should select a spot where the waters coming together from all sides to the centre of it flow round the resting place having the latter on their right side and then are discharged off to the east without noise. Such a spot possesses all auspicious qualities. He should ( Aśv. gr. II.8) also dig a pit knee-deep in the ground to be examined and then fill the pit again with the earth taken out. If the earth taken out fills the entire pit and some earth remains, then the plot is excellent for building a house on; if all the earth dug out just fills the pit, it is of middle quality ; if the earth is not enough to fill the pit the plot is to be rejected. Another method is to fill the pit with water and leave it there through the night. If in the morning there is water in the pit the ground is excellent; if it is moist only, the ground is of middle quality; if it is found dry in the morning the plot is to be rejected. The three dvijātis should respectively select white, red and yellow ground as a site for their house. The plot should be square or rootangular and the owner should draw a thousand furrows on it. With a sami or udumbara branch be sprinkles the ground with water, going thrice round it with his right hand towards it and recites the Santātiya hymn. 1909 He does this thrice pouring out water without interruption with the three verses 'apo hi ştha' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). Under the divisions of the bamboo which rests on the chief posts he should have the single rooms constructed. Into the pits in which the posts are to stand he should have an avakū and the water plant called sipalā put down. Having put the plant into the pit in which the middle post is to stand he should spread on it east-ward pointed and north-ward pointed kusa grass and should sprinkle 

1969. This is Rg. VII. 35. 1-16 in which all verses (except 14 and 15) codamonco with the word "samn' and also have tho same word soyoral times.

on the kušas water into which rice and barley have been thrown with the words to the steady one, the earth demon, svāba." He should when the middle post is being erected repeat over it the two vorges *stand here &c.' and 'to thee the young child may come &o.' Over the bamboo staff when it is placed on the middle post he recites the hemistich rightly ascend the post &o.' On four stones on which dūrvā grass has been spread he should establish the water barrel with the words arise on the earth'or with the verge 'the arangara sounds &c.' He then should pour water into it with the verse 'hither may king Varuņa come &c.' He then appeases it as follows: he puts gold into water in which rice and barley have been put and with that water he sprinkles it three times, going round it with his right turned towards it with the Santātiya hymn. This he does three times pouring water without interruption with the three verses apo bi ştha' (Rg. X. 9.1-3). In the middle of the house he should cook a mess of food, sacrifice from it with the four verses ' Vastoņpate prati'( Rg. VII. 54. 1-3 and VII. 55. 1) verse by verse, 1990 should cook food which should be given to the brāhmaṇas to eat, whom he should cause to say "lucky is the ground.' 

The Matsyapurāņa (chap, 252-257 ) deals at length with Vāstusastra, the construction of a house of various dimensions, its posts, the timber to be employed, the rites to be performed when laying the foundation and at later stages, the rite for Vastuśānti ( propitiatory rite for averting evil ). 

The Matsyapurāņa 1971 (256. 10-11) states that a vāstu yajña has to be performed five times in relation to a house, viz. when laying down the foundation (lit. using the measuring line), when fixing the first post, when raising the first door frame, when entering the house (grhapraveśa) and when vāstu santi is to be performed (for averting evil or on seeing portents). It briefly describes Vāstuyajia as follows (chap. 256. 5-9): On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped at the hands of four brāhmaṇae; the priest who should wear 

1970. The hymn Rg. VII, 54 bes only three verses but four obla tions are directed. Therefore the 4th oblation is to be offered with Rg. VII. 55. 1 which also is addressed to Vastofpati.

white garments should be master of the Veda and should be accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed with water mixed with all herbs (or herbs called sarvauşadhi) and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedio mantras and the tunes of auspicious musio; he should perform a home with honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra 'vāstow spate prati' (Rg. VII. 54. 1); then the owner should feed brāb manas with a dish of rice-milk. The Matsyapurāņa notes that the foundation should be laid in the north-east corner and the first post fixed in the south-east. The Matsyapurāņa (chap. 268) decribes the procedure of Vāstuśānti and remarks ( verses 33-35) that it should be performed when beginning the construction of a temple or a house or a publio park or when entering a town or one's house for the first time for averting all evil and it should also be performed every year in one's house. In that rite he should make the brāhmaṇas repeat the Raksogona hymn and a hymn to Pavamana Soma (one from Rg. IX. or IX. 1). 

In modern times the ceremony of entering a newly built house is an important one, is an extensive affair and marked by great éclat. A very auspicious day is required for this ceremony and numerous astrological considerations enter into the choosing of a proper day. The ceremony of an entrance is preceded on the same day or on the previous day by a vastuśānti (propitiatory rite) of which grahamakha (a rite for propitiating the planets ) forms a part and the usual rites of worship of Ganess and the like ( mentioned at pp. 213-218) have also to be performed. A few salient features are mentioned here. A mandala is drawn divided into 81 squares, 62 devatās are invoked to be present in the mandala, then a homa is offered to the nine planets with 28 oblations of fuel stioks, sesame and ājys to each planet and oblations are offered to other deities, the performer and his wife have holy water sprinkled over their heads from auspicious jars, the house is surrounded thrice with thread beginning from the east to the accompaniment of Rākşoghna (Rg. IV. 4.1-15 or X. 87. 1-25) and Pavamāna (Rg. IX. 1. 1-10) mantras and round the house water is continuously poured in a stream from & jar with the same two hymns. A pit is dug in the south-east corner of the house which is cowdunged, worshipped with flowers and sandalwood paste and a baked brick box containing seven kinds of corn, moss, flowers &c. is lowered into it and the pit is filled up. Then the house is entered to the accompaniment

of musio by the owner who is accompanied by his wife, sons and brahmanas and who holds in his folded hands an auspicious jar filled with water and having fresh sprouts, dūryā grass thereon and marked with sandalwood paste and flowers and covered with cloth. The svasti hymn (vide note 1963 above) and the hymn beginning with 'kranikradat' (Rg. II. 42. 1-3) are recited and the auspicious jar is put down on a heap of corn. Then the brābmapas perform punyahavācana ( vide note 503 above ), they are honoured and utter 'may the house be lucky', dinner is given to the brāhmaṇas who pronounce benedictions, and the owner then takes his meal with his friends. 1972

CHAPTER XXV 

DANA (Gifts ) 

Manu ( I. 86 ) and others state that in the four yugas ( ages ) viz. Kșta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, the principal aspects of religious life were respectively tapas, metaphysical knowledge, sacrifices, 1973 and gifts. Manu (III. 78 ) eulogises the stage of householder as the most worthy because all men in the other asramas are cherished and fed with (Vedic ) knowledge (as a teacher of Vedic students) and with food by him. Yama speci fies the characteristic features of the four aśramas as follows: ‘quiescence is the dharma of ascetics, cessation from taking ordinary food that of forest hermits, dāna (making gifts) that of householders and obedience ( or service ) that of brahmacāring.' Vide Daksa 1. 12-13 also for the peouliar outward characteristios of the four asramas. Therefore the subject of dana ( gifts or obarity ) will now engage our attention. 

Gifts of various kinds and donors have been highly eulogised in the Rgveda. There are danastutis ( eulogies of gifts ) in Rg. I. 125 (where the gifts made by king Svanaya son of Bhāvayavya to Kakşívat are praised and dana in general is eulogised in verses 5–7), l. 126, 1-5 (where the same praise is continued ), V. 61 ( where SyĀvāśva praises the donors Taranta, Purumilha and Ratha. viti ), VI. 47. 22-25 (praise of the donor Prastoka Sārñjaya), VII. 18. 22-25 ( praise of the gifts made by Sudās Paljavana), VIII. 5. 37-39 ( praise of Kasu Caidya ), VIII. 6. 46-48 (praise of Tirindira Pārasavya ), VIII. 46. 21-24 (praise of Kanita ), VIII. 68. 14-19, X. 62. 8-11 (praise of Sāvarņi). Among the objects gifted the most prominent are cows. In Rg. I. 126. 3 Kaksivat represents 1974 that he received sixty thousand cows

from Svanaya, along with ten chariots to each of which four bay horses were yoked and in which young girls were seated. In Rg. VIII. 5. 37 reference is made 1975 to the gifts of ten thousand cows and of 100 camels by Kasu Caidya. In Rg. V. 30. 12 a gift of 4000 cows to Babhru by the men of king Rņañoaya is mentioned. Horses are also often described as objects of gift, e. g. Rg. V. 18. 5 ( gift of 50 horses), VII. 16. 10, VIII. 46. 22 (gifts of 60000 horses, 2000 camels, 1000 bay mares and 10000 cows); VIII. 68. 17. For gifts of camels vide Rg. VIII. 5. 37, VIII. 46. 22. For gifts of young damsels vide Rg. I. 126. 3, VI. 27. 8, VII. 18. 2%, VIII. 19. 36, VIII. 68. 17. The word 'vadbū' used in all these passages cannot mean that the young girls were meant to be the wives of the donees, since in some of them the 'vadhūs' gifted are as many as 10, 20 or even 50.1976 So they were maid servants or female slaves. Rg. X. 117 contains an eulogy of the gift of food, the 6th verse of wbich is the basis of the later teaching of Manu III. 118, Vişnu Dh. 8. 67. 43, Bhagavad-gitā 3. 13 and is as follows: 'the foolish mani997 (who does not share with others ) obtains food to no purpose ; I Bay the truth that it is really his destruction; he does not offer food to Aryaman (i. e, to the gods) nor to his friend (or guest ); one who takes food alone (without giving to others) partakes simply of sin.' This injunction was most assiduously followed at all times in India. In the Chān. Up. IV. 1-2 it is stated that Jānaśruti Pautrāyana, a man of faith and very charitable, bad ereoted everywhere shelters in order to feed at all times all people that came from all quarters. Rg. X. 107 (of 11 verses ) is an apotheosis of dakşiņā (gift or sacrificial fee which generally consisted of a cow or cows), which word is repeated several times in almost every verse. Verges 2, 7 and 8 are very interesting . Those who make gifts of dakşiņā (cows or fee) stand high in heaven, those who make gifts of horses stand in the world of the Sun, donors of gold secure immortality (become gods), those who give garments increase the duration of their life. Gifts endow (the donor) with horses, cows, the

moon (silver?), gold, food which is the life of us and the know ing ( donor) makes gifts of his armour. Donors do not die ( they reach immortality in heaven), they do not go down to a low goal, they are not harmed, nor do they suffer pain; dakşiņā renders unto these donors this whole world and also heaven'. Rg. VI. 47. 23 mentions that from Divodāsa gifts of ten horses, ten boxes (i, e, chariots or boxes of gold), ten garments, in addition to dinners and ten lumps of gold were received. 1978 

It appears that although in the Rg. gifts of horses are spoken of es next in importance to gifts of cows, popular sentiment changed very early. In the Paundarlka sacrifice the fee was a thousand horses and in the Jyotistoma one cow and one horse (Sabara on Jaimini III. 4. 28 ). The Tai. S. II. 3. 12. 1 days 1979 Varuņa indeed seizes him (i. e. he suffers from dropsy ) who accepts the gift of a horse and that one should offer to Varuņa as many offerings prepared on four potsherds as the horses accepted." Jaimini ( III, 4. 28-31 ) establishes two propositions in connection with this that the işti to Varuna is to be performed when the gift of a borse or horses is accepted in & Vedic saorifice and that the işti is to be performed by the donor ( and not by the acceptor). The Kāthaka Saṁ. XII. 6 also recommends that the horse should not be accepted as a gift, as it has two rows of teeth. In the Tai. Br. II. 2. 5 reference is made to the gift of gold, clothes, & cow, & horse, a human being, a bedstead and several other objects and their presiding deities are said to be Agni, Soma, Indra, Varuna, Prajāpati &o. The Tai. S. II. 2, 6. 3 says he who accepts an animal with two rows of teeth, such as a horse or a human being, ( thereby ) secures (to himself ) a portion of ātman (self); he should offer & mess cooked on twelve potsherds to Vaišv.. nara.' Manu X. 89 forbids the sale of the horse and other animals with uneloven hoofs; but the Peboa inscription from Garibnath temple shows that brāhmaṇas engaged in the sale of horses and that a tax agreed to be levied from vendors and purchasers was made into & permanent fund for temples and priests ( vide E. I. Vol. I. p. 186 ). Gaut. 19. 16 men. tions the horse among objects that are gifted by way of

penance for sins. The Sān. Br. ( 25. 14 ) says "980 that he who after promising to gift all, does not give all, is reduced to falling into a deep pit or is killed. The Ait. Br. (30.9) enjoins 1981 that one should not accept a gift rejected by the priests and if one accepts it it should be given over to one's enemy. 

The Sat. Br. (II. 2. 10. 6) says there are two kinds of devas, the gods ( heavenly ) and the human gods viz, brāhmaṇas who have studied the Veda and mastered it; sacrifice is divided between these two, i. e. oblations go to the gods and the fee to the learned brāhmaṇas who are the human gods. These two kinds of gods when gratified place him ( the sacrificer) in nectar (or in the celestial world ).' 1982 The Tai. 8. VI. 1. 6.3 states that it is indeed tapas when 1983 a man makes & gift of what he owns.' We saw above (note 11) how the Br. Up. V. 2. 3 inculcates the three virtues of self-restraint, charity ( dana ) and compassion. In the Ait. Br. 39.6 1984 it is stated that the king when anointed should make gifts of gold, fields and cattle. But it appears from the story of Viśvakarman Bhauvana narrated in the Ait. Br. ( 39,7) and also in the Sat. Br. (XIII. 7. 1. 13-15 ) that when he desired to make a gift of the earth to his priest Kaśyapa As sacrificial fee the earth appeared and . sang a verse' no mortal must give me away as a gift; O 

Viúvakarman Bhauvana, you desired to give me away; I shall plunge into the midst of water, so that this your promise to Kaśyapa is fruitless. It seems however that gifts of villages had come to be made very early. The Chan. Up. IV. 2. 4-5 narrates how Janaśruti desirous of learning the samvargs lore

The literature on dūna is of enormous extent. Apart from casual references in the other parvans of the Mahabharata, the major portion of the Anušāsına parys is devoted to the various aspects of dāng. The Purānas, particularly Agni (chap. 208–215 & 217), Matsya (chap. 82-91 and 274-289) and Varība (chap. 99–111), contain numerous verses on dāna. There are digests specially devoted to the topio of dāna, the most extensive and important being Hemādri's Dānakhanda (of the Caturvarga. cintāmaņi), Dābakriyakaumudi of Govindānands, the Dana mayūkba of Nilakantha, the Dānavākyāvali of Vidyapati, the Dānasāgara of Ballālasong and the Dānaprakāga of Mitre miśra. Only a brief summary of the topics dealt with in all these is attempted below, 

What constitutes gift (dāna ) according to the sāstra has been discussed from very ancient times. There is a distinction between yūga, homa and dana. The first is constituted by abandoning something that belongs to one, intending it for a deity and accompanying it with Vedic mantras; home is throw ing into fire something belonging to oneself over which one abandons one's ownership and which (thing) is intended for a deity; dāna consists in the cessation of one's ownership over & thing and creating the ownership of another over that thing and this last oocurs when the other accepts the thing, which acceptance may be mental or vocal or physical; vide Sabara on Jaimini IV. 2. 28 (quoted above in note 1703 ), VII. 1. 5, IX. 4, 32 and the Mit. on Yāj. II.' 27.1985 The Mit. explains that physical acceptance may be effected in various ways such as by actually receiving the thing in one's hand, by simply touching it and quotes & smrti which illustrates this 'one should give (and the donee may accept) a deer skin (by touching it) on the hairy side, & cow by its tail, an elephant by

its trunk, a horse by its mane, a female slave by (touching ) her head'. The Mit. adds that as it is impossible to accept a field physically (except by enjoying its fruits) its acceptance is effected by some enjoyment, however small, of its produce. The Vişnudharmottara quoted in Danakriyakaumudi p. 7 gives more examples of the method of acceptance. Vide Bṛhat Parāsara (chap. VIII. p. 242) for copious illustrations of the way in which a gift is to be accepted according to the nature of the thing given. The word 'pratigraba' has a technical meaning in Dharmaśāstra. Medbātithi on Manu IV. 5 days 1986 * merely taking a thing (from another) does not constitute pratigraha (as understood in Dharmaśāstra ). The latter word is applicable only to a particular kind of acceptance viz. when a person accepts what is given by the donor with the idea that he (the donor) will derive from that act some unseen spiritual result (adrsta or puṇya) and when in making the gift a vedio mantra is repeated. When one gives alms, no mantra (such as * devasya tva') is repeated and hence that is not the dāna spoken of by sāstra, nor does any one apply the word pratigraha to the acceptance of an article given through affection to a friend or a servant.' When such a word as vidyādāna (gift of learning to a pupil) is used, the word dana is employed there in a figura. tive sepse only; otherwise the teacher will have to give a dakşiņā to the pupil, whereas it is the pupil who may give a dakşiņā to the teacher. When some gift is made to an image, the word dāna in that case is also used in a secondary sense, as the image cannot accept the gift. Therefore Devala defines dana (of the sāstric kind) 1987 as 'that is described as dāna when wealth is given according to sāstrio rites 80 as to reach & receiver who is a fit recipient as defined in the sāstra. What is given to a worthy person without an eye to any particular object (to be achieved by such gift) but solely with the idea of doing one's duty, that is called dharmadana'. The Dana mayükha p. 3 explains that the definition of dāna given by

Dāna 

843 

Devala applies to the best kind of dana (called sāttvika) and not to dana in general. If & gift is sent to a person, but it is lost while on its way or it is stolen and never reaches the donee, then there is no acceptance and so no complete dana and the donor cannot reap the reward of dāns in such a case. 

There are six angas (constituent elements ) of dana, as stated by Devala, 1988 viz. the donor, the donee, sraddhā (charitable attitude), the subject of gift which must have been acquired by the donor in a proper way, a proper time and a proper place. The first four are clearly indicated in Manu IV. 226-227. These six will have to be dealt with one after another. 

One important word that deserves consideration in the sub ject of dāna is iştāpūrla. That word has a high antiguity. It occurs in the Rgveda and the sense seems to be 'the cumulative spiritual result or merit due to a man's performance of sacri. fices and oharitable acts'. Rg. X. 14. 8 is addressed to one recently 1989 dead 'may you join the pitȚs, may you be united with Yame, and with your iştāpūrta in the highest heaven'. The word, though employed in the singular (probably as a samābāra-dvandva compound), consists of two parts, ista ( what is sacrificed) and pārta (what is filled). In the Atharvaveda also the word occurs.' may the iştāpürta of our ancestors save us (from our enemy); I seize yonder (man or enemy) with divine wrath' (II. 12. 4). Vide also Atharvaveda III. 29.1. Some times the two components are employed separately or in the dual when compounded. The Tai, S. V. 7.7.1-3 has the inter esting observation 1990 when he comes by the Devayāna paths, then make ye his iştāpürta manifest to him; whatever sacrifice was offered, whatever was handed over, whatever was given and the dakşiņā offered, may Agni present in all actions place all that in heaven among the gods for us."

years; having sacrificed with an offering that is ever-lasting, & roan ascended to the highest and ever-lasting world' and Tai. Br. III. 9. 14 remarks "the brāhmana ghould sing you made gifts, you performed sacrifices, you cooked food (for serving to others). Indeed iştāpūrta belongs to a brāhmaṇa; he makes him ( the king) prosper by iştāpūrta." The XV, 54 says 'O fire, may you be awake ( or kindled ), may you be watchful for us; join with iştāpūrta ( the sacrificer) and him with his iştāpūrta.' The Kathopanişad I. 1.8 states that when a brāhmaņa guest is allowed to stay in & house without being served with food be destroys the iştāpūrts, the issue and the cattle of the householder. The Mundaka Up. I. %. 10 condemns those who regard iştāpūrta as the highest and do not hold that there is anything higher than that and states that they have to come down to this world or to a lower world again after enjoying the blessings of Heaven. 

Aparārka (p. 290 ) quotes the Mahābhārata for defining ista and purta 1998 whatever is offered in the single fire (i. e. grhys fire) and what is offered in the three srauta fires and the gifts made inside the vedi ( in srauta sacrifices ) are called işta; while dedication of deep wells, oblong large wells and tanks, temples, distribution of food, and maintaining publio gardens these are called pürta." Aparārka quotes Nārada also 'Honour ing a guest and performance of vaiśvadeva constitute ista while the dedication of tanks, wells, temples, places for public distribution of food and gardens is called pürta and also gifts made at the time of eclipses, or on the sun's passage in a zodiacal sign or on the 12th day of a month.' Hemadri (Dāna p. 20 ) quotes Sankha that nursing of those who are ill consti tutes pürta. Manu (IV. 226-227) ordains' one should always absiduously perform işta and purta, which when done with śraddha and with wealth justly acquired become inexhaustible. One should ever resort to dānadharma ( that mode of dharma which consists in gifts ) which is either işta or pūrta, according

to one's means, after meeting a worthy person (as recipient) and with a pleased attitude of mind.' 

Any one including women and sūdras could make gifts. So much emphasis was laid on the duty to make gifts that Aparārka quotes a verse 1993 * two persons should be drowned in water after tying round their neck & large stone, viz. s rich nan not making gifts and a poor man who is not a tapusvin ( who undergoes austerities or who is restrained ).' It is stated in Atri 46, Likbita 6 and other smrtis that 194 'Ista and pārts are dharma common to all twice-born classes; the sūdra las authority to perform pürta dharma, but not the Vaidika dharma (sacrifices etc.), According to Devala the donor should be free from incurable or disgusting diseases, be religious, chari tably inclined, free from vices, pure and following a blameless profession for livelihood. Several smftis note that it is a rare sight to see a man giving away in charity wealth earned by him. Voda-vyāsa'5 (IV. 60) says "amongst a hundred men, one may be found to be brave, among thousands & learned man, among hundreds of thousands an orator, but a donor may or may not be found.' 

A good deal has already been said above (pp. 113-114) about the persons fit to be donees (pātra) and an unfit one. A few more words may be added here. Dakş& III. 17-18 states '& gift made to one's parents, guru, friend, to a well conducted man, to one who has laid the donor under obligation, to the poor, the helpless, those endowed with special excellence, leads to rewards, while gifts made to rogues, to bards, to wrestlers, to those who devote time to bad lores, to gamblers and deceitful persons, to cātas, to pāranas and thieves brings no

fruit (or merit ). 1086 Manu 4. 193-200 ( = Vişnu Db. S. 93. 7-13 ) contains a list of persons to whom gifts should not be made, such as a brābmana who is like a cat or hypocrite or who does not know the vada. Bșhad-Yama III. 34-38 enumerates those brāhmapes who are unfit to be invited at & sraddha or to be donees such as lepers, those who suffer from incurable diseases, those who officiate at sacrifices for sūdras, a devalaka and seller of Veda (teaching it with a prior stipulation for money) and in IV. 55-56 says that gifts made to brāhmaṇas that are addicted to bad actions, that are covetous, devoid of Veda study and sandhyā performance, who have swerved from the vows proper (for brāhmaṇas), who are wicked and who are immersed in pleasures of sense become fruitless. Vanaparva ( 200. 5-9) enumerates 16 futile gifts such as to one who left off the order of sarmyāsa or of wealth acquired by unjust means &c. Almost the same verses occur in Bșhat-Parāśara (VIII. pp. 241-242), which are quoted in Par. M. I, part 1, p. 188. Vide also Vṛddha Gautama (III. obap. pp. 508-509) for numerous futile gifts. It is one's duty to give food at the end of Vaišvadeva to all (vide note 1779 above) and the Vişnudbarmottara directs that as to gifts of food and clothing the only consideration is whether the donor is hungry or in need of clothes and not caste nor qualities. 19966 When on seeing a needy person the donor feels pleasure and indicates it by a smiling face, when he shows honour and is free from a feeling of ill-will or irritation (towards the sup pliant), that is said to be sraddhā, according to Devala. 1997 Manu IV. 235 says that he who gives a gift with honour and he who accepts it with honour both go to heaven, but if the reverse is the case they go to hell. 

Numerous rules are laid down about the things that can be the subject of gifts (i. e. about deya). Whatever is in this

world a most desirable thing and what one prizes most in one's house may be given to a man endowed with good qualities by a donor who desires inexhaustible (merit) from it-Anusasana parva 59. 7.1998 According to Devala, that is a proper subject for a gift, which has been acquired by the donor himself without causing pain or loss to another or without worry or trouble to himself, whether it be small or valuable (or much). 1998 It is not the extent of the gift that causes greater or lesser merit. Merit (punya) of gifts depends upon the mental attitude, the capacity of the giver and the way in which the donor acquired his wealth. If & man2000 were to give even the whole earth acquired by unjust means, or if he makes a gift without sraddha (as defined) or to an unworthy person he would secure no prosperity (religious merit) thereby. On the other hand by making a gift of even a handful of vegetables with a heart full of sraddha and to a very worthy person, he may secure all prosperity. If one possessing a thousand makes a gift of 100 or one having ten makes & gift of one and another gives only water according to his ability, they all reap an equal reward. 

____Among deya things, some are the best, some middling, some inferior. Food,3005 curds, honey, protection, cow, land, gold, horse and elephant -- gifts of these nine are said to be the best ; learning, house for shelter, domestic paraphernalis (like oots ), 

medicine-these four are said to be middling; shoes, swings, carts, umbrellas, vessels, seats, lamps, wood, fruits and what ever is old and worn out and all other unspecified objects are inferior. Yaj. (I. 210-211) appears to have this difference in view when he says thataman, making agift of land (capable

Gifts of three things are said to be superior to the gift of anything else and are styled *00% atidana, viz. of cows, land and Sarasvati (vidya) according to Vas. Dh, S. 29. 19 and Bṛhaspati 18. Vas, Dh. S. 29. 19, Manu 4. 233, Atri, 340, Yāj. I. 21% say that the gift of vidyā is the best of all gifts such as those of water, food, cows, land, garments, sesame, gold and clarified butter. On the other hand Anusagana-parva (62.2) and the Visnudharmottara ( quoted by Aparārk& p. 369 ) gay that the gift of land surpasses all other gifts. The Vişņu Dh. S. 92. 1 says that the gift of protection from danger (abbayadāna) is the highest. The gifts of certain objects were called mahādanas. These and a few other dānes will be dealt with in some detail later on. 

Danas are divided into nitya 2003 (called ajasrika by Devala), naimittika and kāmya. Whatever is given everyday (such as food after Vaišvadeva &o.) is nitya, what is given at certain specified times (such as on eclipses) or on account of doing certain acts (such as penance for lapses) is called naimittika. what is given through the desire of securing progeny, victory, prosperity, heaven or a wife is called kāmya (as it springs from & desire). Dedication of a garden or of a well &c. is called dhruvadāns (permanent gift) by Devala; while the Kurma purāna adds to the well-known three a fourth division called vimala (pure) defined by it as 'what is given to those who know brahma for securing the grace of God with a mind full of devotion.' Vas. Dh. 8. 29. 1-15, Vişnu Dh. S. 92 and Manu IV, 229-232 (which are repeated in Viddha-Gautama, chap. XI. p. 586 ) and many of the purāņas are eloquent over what

rewards a man reaps by making gifts of water, food, sesame &c. The Bhagavad-gitā (17. 20-22) divides dānas into sāttvika, rājass and tāmasa and defines them as follows: When a gift is made because one feels it one's duty to make it and at a proper time and place and to a worthy person who will not return it, it is oalled sāttvika; when it is made with an expectation of the donee doing a good turn in return or with a view to secu ring some reward therefrom and is given grudgingly, it is rājasa; when a gift is made at an 'improper time or place and to an unworthy person and without showing honour to the reci pient and with disrespect (or contempt), it is declared to be tāmasa. 

Many texts emphasize 8 rule similar to that in the Bible * But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in seoret-Matthew VI. 3-4. Yogi-Yājñavalkya says 2004 that the reward of making gifts secretly, possessing knowledge without being puffed up and engaging in japa without others seeing it is infi nite. Devals says 'sacrifice, gift and study lose their power and perish by being declared to others, by boasting about them or by repenting of having done them. Therefore one should not without good reason (such as protecting a gift &c.) proclaim one's meritorious act.' 

Certain things when offered voluntarily by a person with his own hand must be accepted and not spurned even by one who does not ordinarily accept gifts. Manu IV. 247-250, Yāj. I. 214-215, Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 13-14, Vişnu Dh. S. 57. 11 declare that kušas, vegetables (raw), milk, fish, fragrant substances, flowers, curds, clay, flesh, a bedstead, a Beat, fried barley, water, precious stones, fuel-sticks, fruits and roots, honey, food offered without being asked (except of the impotent, of prosti tutes and of patita) must not be spurned, but must be accepted. 

Certain objects could not be donated either because one bad no ownership over them or because the sages forbade such gifts. Jaimini (V1.7.1-7) establishes several propositions, viz. that one can make a gift only of what one owns, that one cannot make

a gift of one's relatives (parents, sons and others) in the Visva jit, that & sovereign cannot make a gift of the whole of his kingdom, that horses cannot be gifted in that sacrifice as śruti forbids such a gift in that sacrifice, that a sūdra who serves the sacrificer merely as a duty cannot be given away and that what over is of the full ownership of a person at the time of giving the dakşiņā can alone be gifted in the Visvajit sacrifice. Nārada200% (dattāpradānika 4-5) forbids eight kinds of gifts viz. of what is handed over to a creditor by a debtor for delivery to a third person, what is borrowed for use (such as an ornament on a festive occasion), a pledge, property jointly owned with others, a deposit, son and wife, one's entire property when one has children, what has been already promised to another man. Daksa III. 19-20 enumerates nine things as not proper subjects of gifts ( adding to Nārada's list ' a friend's wealth and gift through fear'and omitting what is already promised to another'). Yaj. II. 175 is of similar import. Apararka p. 779 quotes verses of Bphaspati and Kātyāyana to the same effect. Vide above (pp. 507-508) as to a man's power over his children. 

The texts took care to set limits to a man's generosity. After emphasizing in very eloquent language the obligation to share one's possessions, however meagre, with others, Veda-Vyasa 2006 (IV. 30-31) inculcates the doctrine that charity begins at home. Ap. Dh. S. II. 4.9.10-12, Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 19 ordain that one should not stint one's dependents (whom one is bound to main tain), one's servants and slaves for distributing food to guests and others. Yaj. II. 175 prescribes that one should make gifts in such a way as not to cause detriment to one's family. Bpbaspati&007 explains this by saying that one may give away

wealth that is over and above what is required for maintaining one's family and for clothing and that the charity of one who disregards this rule is something that is sweet like honey at first but like poison in its effect. In this Bịhaspati only echoes what Manu says ( XI. 9-10) 'the charity of him who has wealth enough to make gifts to strangers, when his own people live a life of misery, is only a false imitation of dharma (and not the true dharma), it is at first like honey but will taste like poison (later). Whatever a man does for his welfare in the next world by stinting those whom he is bound to maintain results in un happiness to him while living and also after death'. The Anugāsana parva (37. 2-3) declares that if one makes & gift stinting one's servants, he makes himself a sinner, even though one may say tbat one would give whatever any one begs for (compare Luke VI. 30 give to every man that asketh of thee'). Hemādri quotes 2008 Sivadharma to the effect that a man should set apart three parts out of five from his acquisitions for bim self and his family and two parts for dharma, as life is evanescent, 

Certain things were forbidden to be accepted as gifts. The gift of animals with two rows of teeth was forbidden by sruti (vide Sabara on Jaimini VI. 7. 4 quoted above). Vas. Dh. S. 13. 55 declares that a brāhmaṇa should not accept the gift of weapons, poisonous substances and spirituous liquor. Manu IV. 188 states that a brāhmaṇa who is not learned should not accept the gift of gold, land, horses, cow, food, garment, sesame, clarified butter; but if bo accepts he is reduced to asbes ( i. e. perishes ) like wood. Hemādri ( Dāna p. 57 ) quotes the Brahma purāņa that a brāhmaṇa should not accept the gifts of ewes, horses, precious stones, an elephant, sesame and iron, and that one who accepts a gift of antelope skin or sesame would not be born again as a male and that if a person accepts the bedstead, ornaments and the clothes of one who is dead he would go to hell. 

As to the proper times for gifts, several rules are laid down, Apart from the daily duty to make gifts ( Yāj. I. 203 ) gifts had to be made on special occasions and if so made were more meritorious than the gifts inade daily. Laghu-Sātātapa (145-153)

gays 2009 that a gift must be made on the first day of each ayana ( the sun's passage to the north or south ), at the beginning of Şadasiti and while an eclipse of the sun or moon is in progress and that the rewards of the gifts made on these ocoasions are inexhaustible. Vanaparva 200. 125 is to the same effect. A gift made on Amāpāsyā imparts rewards a hundred times (of the reward of making it on any ordinary day), a thousand times when made on the suppression of a tithi, a hundred thousand times when made on the equinoctial day and a gift brings endless rewards when made on Vyatipāta. Sasvarta (208–209) says that gifts made on the ayana day, equinoctial day, vysti. pāta, the suppression of a tithi and on the eclipses of the sun and moon, on new moon day, 12th day, samkranti(sun's passage into a zodiacal sign) becomes inexhaustible and these tithis are highly commended and so also Sunday for a bath, japa, home, dinner to brāhmaṇas, fast and gifts.2010 Sātātapa ( 146) states that 16 ghatikās before and also after the moment when the sun enters & new zodiacal sign is the holy time for gifts, while others give 30 ghatikās (before and after ) for Karkataka (Cancer samkrānti), 20 for Makara (Capricorn) and 105 for Tula (Balance ) and Meşa (Aries). Visvarüpa on Yaj. I. 214-217 states that the times specified as the proper occasions for srāddha are all of them the most appropriate times for making gifts. Vide Prajapati 25 and 28 and Atri 327 for similar rules. Savkha says that if amāvāsyā falls on Monday, the 7th tithi on Sunday, 4th on Tuesday, 8th on Wednesday these four are like

eclipses and 80 gifts made on these days yield infinite rewards ( quoted by Hemidri, dānakhanda p. 66). The Viępu Dh. S. chap. 89 deals with the rewards of the gifts of various articles made on the full moon days of the twelve months of the year, Anuśāsana chap. 64 speaks of dānas on the 27 nakşatras from kịttikā. 

The general rule was that gifts were not to be made at nigbt. But there are several exceptions. Atri 327 states that & gift even at night is commended on the occasions of eclipses, marriages, sankrantis and the birth of a child. Devala 2011 quoted in Par. M. I. part I, p. 194 has a similar verse and the Par. M. adds that only on the Cancer and Capricorn samkrāntis are gifts allowed to be made at night. 

The above rules about the special occasions for gifts are amply borne out by epigraphic evidence. A few examples may be oited. A very large number of grants on copper and stone relate to gifts of lands and villages at the time of solar eclipses, For example, vide Tiwarkhed plate of Rāstrakūta Nannaraja dated sake 553 (653 ?) in E. I. vol. XI. p. 279, I. A. vol. VI, p. 73 (in sake 534 i. e, 613 A. D.), the grant of 30 nivartanas of land purchased for 30 gadyāņakas of gold on a total eclipse of the sun in 754 A. D. in the time of Cālukya Kirtivarman II (E. I. vol. III. p. 6), E. I. vol. III. p. 193 (of sake 716 ), E. I. vol. IX, p. 100 (in 660 A. D.). Grants on the occasion of a lunar eclipse are found in J. B. B. R. A. S. vol, 20, p. 135 (Navsari plates of Raştrakūta Mahasamanatadhipati Karkarāja issued in sake 738, i. e. 817 A. D.), in E. I. vol. I. p. 341 (Patna Inscription of the time of Yadava Singhaņa dated sake 1128 i. e. 1207 A.D.), E.I. vol. 19, p. 41, E.I. vol. 20, p. 125 (in saivat 1108). Grants on ayana days may be seen in I. A. vol. 12, p. 193 (Haddala plates of the Cāpa Mahāsā mantadhipati Dharaņi-varāba issued in sake 836), the Saõjan grant of Amoghavarşa dated Sake 793 (Uttarayaņa-Mabāparvani). Grants on Samkrāntis are found in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 182 ( Dhulia plate of Karkarāja dated sake 701), E. I. vol. XII. p. 142 (in 1087 A. D.). E. I. vol. VIII. p. 159 (in sarvat 1207 ). It may be noted that not only on the sun's passage in a rāši, but even on Jupiter's passage in a rasi ( Taurus in this case ) a grant was made as seen in Lucknow Museum plate of Kirtipāla (E. I. vol. VII, p. 93 in sarvat 1167 i, e. 1111 A. D.). A village was

granted on Vişuvasamkrānti to s brāhmaṇa in honour of Buddha by Mahipala I, a.king of Bengal (vide E. I. vol. XIV, p. 324). For grants on Akşaya Tftigā (3rd of the bright half of Vaisakha) vide E. I. vol. 14, p. 198 (when 32 villages were granted to 500 brahmanas in samvat 1156) and E. I. vol. VII. p. 98 (Lar plates of Govindacandra of Kanoj in saivat 1202). For & grant made on Mahākartiki (the full moon day of Kārtika) vide E. I. vol. X, p. 75 (which is a grant to several brāhmaṇas for ena - bling them to offer bali, caru, vaišvadeva, agnihotra and the five mahāyajñas, in Kalacuri saivat 292 i. e. about 540 A. D.). 

The places ( deśa) where gifts are to be made are also speci fied in the smštis, purāņas and digests. Gifts 2018 made in the house yield ten times as much merit (as when made elsewhere), a hundred times when made in & cowpen, & thousand times when made in sacred places (tirthas) and an infinite number of times when made near an image (or linga) of Siva. The Skanda purāņa 2018 quoted by Hemādri ( dana p. 83) states that Benares, Kuruksetra, Prayāga, Puşkara (Ajmer), the banks of the Ganges and of the ocean, Naimiş& forest, Amara-kantaka, Sriparvata, Mahakāla (at Ujjayini), Gokarna, Veda-parvata-these and the like are declared to be holy places resorted to by gods and siddhas; all mountains, all rivers and the ocean are holy; the habitations of cows, siddhes and søges are also boly; whatever is donated in these sacred places confers infinite reward. 

When making & gift of anything one has to pour water on the hand of the donee. Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 9-102014 states that all gifts are to be made with water except in the case of vedio sacrifices where they are to be made as directed by the vedic texts. Gautama V. 16 says the same. In the case of all gifts they are to be accompanied by a separate dakşiņā. The Agni purāna2018 211. 31 makes an exception in the case of gifts of

gold, silver, copper, husked rice, corn, daily śrāddha and daily devapūjā ( which may be without daksinā). That dakşiņā should consist pre-eminently of gold, but if gold itself is the article donated then the dakşiņā may be of silver. In the case of very costly gifts like tulāpuruşa, the dakşiņā may be one hundred or fifty or 25 or ten niskas or one-tenth of the price of the thing gifted or according to ability. 

Hemādri (Dāna pp. 96-97) and Dānamayūkba (pp. 11-12) quote verses from the Vişnudharmottara stating the presiding deities of the several articles that are donated (such as Agni of gold, Prajāpati of dāsas, Rudra of cows &c.) and adds that wherever no presiding deity is specifically named Vişnu is the presiding deity. Those very verses are quoted as from the Kapila pascarātra in the Dānakriyākaumudi (p. 5). The Agnipurāņa (209. 40-48 ) has similar verses. This notion is derived from the Brāhmapas and Srautasūtras which speak of Rudra as the pre siding deity of the gifts of cows, Soma of garments, Prajāpati of human beings and so on ( vide Tai. Br. II. 2.5, Āp. Śr. 14. 11. 3). 

The general procedure of making gifts may be stated here once for all. The donor and the donee should have taken their bath and should wear two white garments each, the donor should wear & pavitra, perform acamana, should face the east, should wear the sacred thread in the upavita form, be seated on & pure seat (of kuģa &c.) and seat the dones on & seat and make him face the north, then the donor should utter the name of the subject of gift, its presiding deity and the purpose for which he makes the gift, and say 'I make a gift to you of such and such an article, pour water on the donee's hand, and when the donee says 'give' the donor should sprinkle water on the subject of gift and place it into the hand of the donee, who utters the syllable .om' and says 'svasti'. Then dakşiņā is given to the donee. The detailed formula is set out below.8016 Necessary changes 

2016. The formula may be described as follows: STEER ATH भमुके पक्षे अमुकतिधौ अनुकराशिस्थे भास्करे भारतवर्षाख्यभूपदेशे सूर्यग्रहणादौ अमुक गोत्रः अमुकशर्मा अमुककाम: अमुकगोत्राय अमुकमबराय अमुकशर्मणे ब्राह्मणाय इदम मुकद्रग्यं अमुकदेवसं तुम्यमहं संप्रददे इति द्विजकरमध्ये सकुशं जलं वद्यात् ।ग्रहीता करमध्येन गृहीत्वा स्वस्तीति पवेत् । अयेत्यादि. अमुककामनया कृतस्य अमुकदानकर्मणः प्रतिष्ठार्थ दक्षिण अमुकगोत्राय अमुकशर्मणे ब्राह्मणाय तुभ्यमह संमददे न मम इति वृक्षिणां वधात् ।। Vide shyrio 209, CARE (TBK) pp. 606-7 and Theft pp. 14 ff. for the procedure. The singero 209. 59-61 mentions the following purposes for which gifts are usually made 'पुत्रपौत्रगृहैश्वर्यपस्नीधर्मार्थसणाः । कीतिविधामहाकाम-सौभाग्यारोग्यदये। सर्वपापोपशान्त्यर्थ स्वर्गाथै झुक्तिमुक्तये। एतत्सम्य संमददेमीयतां मे हरिस शिषः॥

have to be made as to the statement of the occasion, the receipt of the subject of gift &c. (if it is land or a house, it cannot be received in the hand; the donee simply walks round it or on it or enters it). ___Yaj. I. 133 prescribes that the king should daily make gifts to brahmanas learned in the Veda, of milch cows, gold, land, houses and the requisites of marriage (i. e. maideps, expenses of marriage &o.). This was nothing new that was prescribed by Yaj. It has been followed for ages by the kings. The Vanaparv 2017 186. 15 states that he who makes a gift of a maiden in the brābma form or of land enjoys bliss in the world of Indra. We find from the inscriptions of Usavadata 2018 (pro bably in the 1st century A.D.), son-in-law of Nahapana, at Karle and Nasik that he gave 3 lakhs of cows, 16 villages to gods and brāhmaṇas, fed one lakh of brāhmaṇas every year, got eight brāhmaṇas married at his own expense at Prabhāsa ( in Kathiawar), built flights of steps on the river Barnasa, con structed quadrangles, houses and halting places (pratiśraya) at Bharukaccha (modern Broach), Dasapura (in Malwa), Govardhana (Nasik) and Sorparaga (modern Sopara), con structed wells and tanks; kept free ferry boats over the rivers Iba, Parada, Damana, Tapi, Karabena, Dahanuka (all between Thana and Surat); established meeting halls and shelters for gratuitous distribution of water; conferred 32000 cocoanut trees in Nanangola (modern Nargol) on the assembly of brāhmaṇas of the Carska sākha at Rāmatirtha in Sorpāraga and three other places. He adds that be purchased from a brāhmaṇa for 4000 kārsapanas a field that originally belonged to the brahmana's father and made a grant of it for supplying food to the assembly

of monks coming from all quarters that dwelt in the cave constructed by him. This is certainly & formidable list of benefactions for one ruler. 

As to spending money for the marriages of brāhmaṇas and settling them as householders, a few words may be said here. Dakşa2014 III. 32-33 says 'The merit of him, that establishes & brāhmaṇa who is without father or mother by performing his samskāras and by getting him married, is beyond reckoning' A man does not secure that bliss by observance of agnihotra or the performance of Agnistoma, which he secures by establi shing a brāhmaṇa in life'. Aparārka (p. 377) quotes a long passage from the Kālikāpurāna about Naivesika dana. Its purport is briefly as follows: "The donor should choose eleven brāhmaṇas of śrotriya families ( devoted to the study of the Veda) and of good oharacter and conduct, should build eleven houses for them, should get them married at his expense, should furnish the houses with stores of corn, with cattle and maid servants, beds, seats, vessels of clay and copper and other utensils for taking food and with garments; and having thus furnished the houses, should settle the eleven brāhmaṇas in the eleven houses and for their maintenance bestow upon each one hundred nivartanas of land or a hamlet, or half a village; he should induce the brāhmaṇas to be agnihotrins. By so doing he secures all the merit that is secured by the performance of sacrifices, vratas, various dānas or pilgrimages to sacred places and enjoys in heaven all pleasures. A man who is unable to do as much as above may settle only one brāhmaṇa according to his means and he secures the same rewards'. In the Epigraphic records there are numerous instances of kings spending for the marriages of brahmaņas. For example, the Aphsad Inscription of Adityasena ( vide Gupta Inscriptions No. 42, p. 203 ) speaks of gifts of agrahāras on the marriages of one hundred brāhmaṇa girls to brābmaņas. A copper-plate grant of the Silāhāra prince Gandarāditya speaks of the king having got 16 brāh manas married at his expense and of having created endow ments of three nivartanas for each for their maintenance at the time of their marriages (vide J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. 13, p. 1, dated 1032 šake). As the brāhmaṇas were supposed to lead a

life of comparative poverty, plain living and high thinking and as they were the inheritors, preservers and transmitters of the sacred literature of the country, as they also engaged in teaching without stipulating for any fee, the State that bad in those days no settled educational system as in modern times deemed it its duty to provide the resources which would enable the brāhmaṇas to carry on their self-imposed task. Yāj. II. 185 declares that the king should set apart in his capital & place for the habitation of brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda, should establish them there, should provide means of maintenance for them and then say to them 'follow your duties' (svadbarma), Aparārka quotes (p. 792) thereon from Bịhaspati several verses that add 'the king should bestow on the brāhmaṇas who are learned and kindle the sacred fires (Agnihotrins) houses and lands under his own ediots from which no taxes in the present or future would be levied. The brāhmaṇas 80 settled should perform for the citizens their religious rites whether daily or to be performed on Occusions or kāmya or for averting evil omens or for the sake of prosperity and should give decisions in the cases of doubts. They should make rules and conventions for the whole village or for corporations and guilds and for reli. gious purposes. Those rules must be observed and when there is trouble caused by rogues and thieves all must join to put it down and that object must not be left to one person. 2020 These prescriptions indicate what benefit was expected of the marriages and settlement of learned brāhmanas. Kaut. II. 1 also pres oribes that lands free from taxes and fines should be settled upon purohitas, śrotriyas &c. There is nothing peculiar to India or to the caste system in this. Among the numerous charitable purposes mentioned in the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth ( 43 Eliz. chap. 4) which (preamble) is even now applicable in England 'the marriage of poor maids' is one. 

The gift of land has been eulogized as the most meritorious of all gifts from ancient times. Vas. Dh. S. 29. 16 quotes & verse which is found also in Bșhaspati 7, Vişnudharmottara and Matsyapurāņa (quoted by Aparārka pp. 369, 370), the

Mabābbārata (Anušāsana 62. 19) and which says' whatever 2041 sin & man may commit when in straitened circumstances, he is purified therefrom by making a gift of only as much land as is equal to gocarma'. Aparārka (pp. 368, 370) quotes many verses from the Vişnudharmottara, the Adityapurāņa, the Matsyapurāņa on the high rewards reaped by the gift of land. The Vanaparva 2022 (93, 78-79) declares 'whatever sing a king is guilty of in bringing the earth under his control, all those he gets rid of by performing sacrifices with munificent gifts ; by bestowing on brāhmaṇas lands and cows in thousands, the king becomes free from all sins as the moon is freed from darkness' (Rāhu ). Anušāsana 59.5 voices the popular Bentiment that .gifts of gold, cows and land save even the wicked'.

As gifts of land were so highly valued, the smrtis contain numerous rules about them. Yāj. (I. 318-320)2088 prescribes the following rules: 'wben a king makes a gift of land or bestows a nibandba he should execute a writing (about the gift) for the information of future good kings.

cloth or on a copper-plate marked at the top with his seal and write down thereon the names of his ancestors and of himself, the extent (or measurements) of what is gifted and set out the passages (from smrtis) that condemn the resumption of gifts'. Vigvarüpa the oldest extant commentator of Yāj. states that the edict or order should also bear the names or signatures of the royal officers such as ājñā, dūtaka, the name of the place where the king's army is encamped &c. and that the names of woinen (such as the queen mother or queen) should be mentioned, and that verses stating the result of resuming gifts made by former kings should find place in the edict. Apararka (pp. 579-580) quotes long extracts from Bphaspati and Vyāss on the same subject. Bệhaspati says that a royal edict recording a gift of land should be executed on a piece of cloth or on copper-plate, should state the place (of issue) and (the names of) tbe king's ancestors, that it should be stated to last till the sun and moon endure, that it was not to be resumed or taken baok and was to be free from all future taxes and that it was to go on to the sons and grandsons from generation to generation (of the donee), it should state that heaven would be the reward of the donor and those that continued the gift, that the result of the resumption of the gift would be hell for 60,000 years to the resumer and it should bear the king's seal, the year, the month, the fortnight and day and should bear the signature of the superintendents (royal officers). Vyāsa after stating these requisites adds that the edict should be addressed to brābmanas and other respectable people, to the king's officers, to all householders and to all others including medas and cāndalas, that it should state that the gift is made for securing merit for one's parents and one's self. 

The thousands of copper-plate grants and inscriptions on stone published so far show that these directions contained in Yāj., Br. and Vyāsa have been followed to the letter from at least the 5th century onwards. In the earliest inscriptions verses about the merit of gifts and the sin of resumption do not ocour. For example, in Gupta Inscription No. 8 (pp. 36 ff) dated 88 of the Gupta Era (i. e. 407-8 A. D.) of Chandragupta II the only words (in prose) are 'whoever would cut off this charitable gift would be guilty of the five great sins'; similarly in the Gupta Inscription No. 5 (p. 32) dated Gupta era 93 the words are 

• whoever would destroy this charity now set on foot would be guilty of the murder of brāhmaṇas and cows and of the five

sing that bring immediate punishment'. In the Inscriptions of the early Pallava king Sivaskandavarman also (E. I. vol. I p. 7) such verses are not found. In the copper-plate grant of Skanda-gupta (dated 146 Gupta year i. e. 465-66 A. D., Gupta Inscriptiong2044 No. 16, p. 68 ) there is a verge on the point, but it is not one of those that are found in most inscriptions. 

In the earliest records verses lauding gifts and deprecating their resumption are few (one or two) but in later records their number increases. For example, in the copperplate of Maitraka Vyāghrasena (E. I. vol. XI, p. 221) there are only two verses and in the plates of Dhruvasena dated Gupta-Valabhi samvat 206 and 210 respectively there are only two and three verses (E. I. vol. XI. pp. 107, 111 ), while there are 16 verses in an insoription of Yabahkarnadeva dated in Kalacuri sarvat 823 ( E. I. vol. XII p. 205 ) and 15 vorges in the copperplate grant of Cahamāna Ratnapāla dated in Vikrama samvat 1176 (E. I. vol. XI, pp. 312-313). In most of the inscriptions containing these lauda tory and imprecatory verses, they are oited as from Vyāsa or Manu or from smrti in general. In the Appendix 2095 a list of about forty such verses is given and in the footnotes it is pointed out wherever possible from what smrti or other source they are taken and a reference is made to some of the earliest inscriptions and grants where they occur. The references will show that these verses occur in inscriptions from all parts of India. Two of the most usual verses are : 'the earth was donated by many such kings as Sagara and others; whatever king is lord of the earth at any particular time enjoys the reward ( merit) of the gift of that land. The donor of land enjoys bliss in heaven for sixty thousand years and he who

destroys (or resumes ) it or who abets the destruction dwells in hell for the same period.' In spite of such imprecations it appears that lands donated by former kings were sometimes confiscated by their successors. For example, in an inscription of Indrarāja III dated sake 836 it is stated that the king restored four hundred villages that had been confiscated by former kings (E. I. vol. IX, p. 24 at p. 33 'pūrvaprthvipala. viluptani); in the Talmanchi plates of Calukya Vikramaditya I ( dated 660 A, D.) there is a recital that'he re-established the endowments of temples and brāhmaṇas that had been lost in the three kingdoms' (E. I. vol. IX. p. 100). The Rājatarangiņi (V. 166-170 ) states that king Samkaravarman ( in the first half of the 10th century), the son of Avantivarman, deprived temples of all their properties for replenishing his treasury emptied by his vices.2028 Parāśara (XII, 51 ) says that the sin of resuming land already donated cannot be expiated even by performing a hundred Vājaper& sacrifices or by the gift of millions of cow. In the Khoh plates of Parivrājaka Maharaja Saṁkşobha (Gupta Insoriptions No. 25 p. 115 ) dated Gupta samvat 209 (528-529 A. D.) there is & peculiar curse pronounced on him who would interfere with his gift 'him who would interfere with this gift I shall, though functioning in another body ( on account of rebirth), consume (burn) with terrible ourses (or imprecatory thoughts )'. Vide also Gupta Ing. No. 23 p. 107 of G. S. 191. When a grant of a village or villages was made kings excepted therefrom grants already made in favour of shrines of gods and brāhmaṇas. For example, in the Pikira Grant of Simhavarman ( E. I. VIII. p. 162 ) it is stated 

this village is granted by us as a gift to brāhmaṇas excepting the cultivated lands given as endowment to gods' (devabho gabalavarjam ). In E. I. vol. X. p. 88 ( of 697 sake) the grant excludes the portion already bestowed on gods and brāhmaṇas' (pārvapratta-deva-brahma-dāya-rahitaḥ). The grant of the village by the Candella king Paramardideva in sam, 1236 expressly excludes five balas ( land measure) of land granted to Buddha (i. e. to a temple of Buddha then existing). Vide E. I. XX. at p. 129. This shows that & Hindu king respected an endowment already made to a shrine of Buddha or to a monastery of Buddhists ( devasri-buddha-gatka-pancahalam

I. 14, p. 194 ( sain. 1150 ); E. I. vol. I, p. 85 at p. 88 (G. S. 334 ). There are many instances where kings making grants of a field say that they purchased it from the owner and then bestowed it. For example, in E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 there is a grant by Kumāragupta (G. S. 193 ) of this character and see p. 856 above where such a grant is referred to. Even in the most ancient grants what is granted is set out with great parti. cularity. A few examples will show this. In the Nasik Inscrip tion No. 3 of Vasithiputa 2027 Siri-Puļumāyi ( E. I. vol. 8 p. 65 ) the grant is in these words. And to this village of Samalipada (Salmalipadra ) we grant the immunity belonging to monk's land, making it not to be entered by royal officers, not to be touched (by any of them ), not to be dug for salt, not to be interfered with by the district police, (in short) to enjoy all kinds of immunities'. So also the Mayidavolu plates 2028 of the Pallava Sivaskandavarman state ( E. I. vol. VI, p. 87 ) to this village of Viripara we grant all the immunities enjoyed by the brahmadeyas. Let it be free from digging for salt, free from being interfered with by the district police (or officers ), free from supply of bullocks in succession, free from the entrance of soldiers, free from supply of boiled rice, water pots, cots and lodgings, with these and all other immunities prescribed by rules ) regarding all brahmadeyas, we have caused it to be exempted'. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 55, p. 235 (the Chammak copperplate of Pravarasena II ) 2029 there are numerous words about the various taxes and exactions remitted which it is difficult to understand at this distance of time, but some of

which may be stated it was to be free from taxes, not to be entered by the regular soldiers, nor by cāļas, it was to be entirely free from all obligations of forced labour, it was to carry with it hidden treasure and all deposits.' 

It is often stated in the grants that lands or villages are granted with the eight bhogas (vide E. I. vol. VI. at p. 97, the Gadag Ins, of Hoysala Vira-Ballaļa in sake 1114). The eight bhogas are enumerated in some of the inscriptions themselves, In the Srisaila plates of Virūpākşa (of sake 1388) they are stated to be nidhi ( treasure trove), niksepa ( what is deposited on the land), vāri (water), aśman (stones, mines), akşiņi ( actual privileges), āgāni (future profits), siddha ( what is already brought under cultivation), Bādbya (wasto land that may in future be turned into cultivable land ).8030 In the times of the Marathas when lands or villages were granted it was usual to put in such words as 'jalataru-trņa-kāştha-pāşāņa-nidhi-nikşepa' (water, trees, grass, wood, stones, treasure-trove and deposits). It has been decided by the modern Indian Courts that these words conferred on the grantee ownership in the soil itself and that in the absence of these words it is possible to hold that the grant was only of the royal share of the revenue and not of the soil itself. 2031 

The question whether the king is the owner of all land in his kingdom has been discussed from very ancient times. Jaimini (VI. 7. 3) states the proposition that in the Visvajit sacrifice ( where the sacrificer has to donate everything that belongs to him) even the emperor cannot make a gift of the whole earth of which he may be the ruler, since the earth is common to all (to the sovereign as well as to those who cultivate

it and make use of it). Sabara 1088 elaborates this by adding that others have as much right over the earth as the emperor, that the emperor is entitled to a share of crops produced from the earth as his since he protects them; but that all other persone also walk on the earth, produce crops on it, get their sustenance from it and so they also have rights over the earth and therefore there is no difference between the emperor and other persons as to rights over the earth. This view is relied upon by the Vyavahāramayükba 8083 which says therefore it is said in the 6th chapter of Jaimini that the whole earth cannot be given away by the emperor and a province by a feudatory chief. The ownership in the several villages and fields on the entire earth or in a province belongs to the holders of the land alone, while kings are entitled only to collect taxes. Therefore when kings now make what are technically called gifts of fields, no gift of land ( soil) is effected thereby, but only provision is made for the maintenance of the donee (from the taxes which are alienated by the king). Where however bouses and fields are purchased from the holders thereof (by the king) be bas also ownership (over the fields &c.) in those cases and he in such cases secures the full merit of the gift of land (if he makes a gift of such fields)'. These paesages embody the important proposition that the state is not the owner of all lands, but is only entitled to levy taxes from the holders of land. 

There is another view also according to which the king was the owner of lands and the subjects were only ocoupants. This latter view, being more convenient and paying, has been adopted in modern times by the British Government in its policy and legislation (e. g. vide section 37 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, Bombay Act V. of 1879). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 318 states 2034 that the words of Yāj. imply that the privileges of

making a gift of land or of a nibandha belonged only to the king and not to the governor of a province or a district under the king. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 114 quotes a smști 8038 'land passes on the happening of six ciroumstances viz. with the con sent of one's village, of one's agnatio relations, of sūmantas, and of one's coparcepers and when accompanied with water and ( dakşiņā of) gold' and remarks that the consent of sāmantas (neighbours ) is only necessary AB & safeguard against disputes about boundaries and that of the villagers is necessary for giving notice of the alienation to all. As the king is not men tioned here, the king's consent does not appear to have been necessary for the gift of land by a private person. But it appears that the king's consent was sometimes sought for gifts by private persons and obtained e. g. in Gupta Ins. No. 31 p. 135 Mahārāja Sarvanātha (G. S. 214 ) approves of a gift of two villages made to a person and his sons and grandsons in succes sion for the worship of the goddess Pistapurikādevi by & doneo to whom they had been originally granted. 

On account of the great value attached to copper-plate grants as documents of title, there were great temptations to forge them. In the Madhuban copper-plate of Harşa ( E. I. vol. VII. p. 155 at p. 158 ) reference is made to a grant fabricated by & certain brāhmaṇa named Vānarathys about a village called Somakuņdakā. Manu IX. 232 prescribes death as the penalty for fabricators of royal oberters. Vide Fleet on 'Spurious Indian Records' in I. A. vol. 30, p. 201. 

From Manu and other smrtikāras it appears that so far as lands already brought under cultivation are concerned they appear to hold that the ownership of the land is in the culti vators and the king is only entitled to levy taxes for the protection ho affords. In Manu VII. 130-132 it is stated 'the king should take a fiftieth part of cattle and gold and a sixth, 8th or 12th part of the orops and a sixth part of trees, flesh, honey, ghed, perfumes, herbs, liquids, flowers, roots and fruits &o.' and in X. 118 Manu allows the king to raise his demand in times of emergenoy to a fourth of the produce of land. Manu IX. 44 states that a field belongs to him who uproots the stems of trees and shrubs from waste or unculti. vated land. Manu VIII. 39 provides that in ancient treasure.

trove found underneath the ground and in mines the king is entitled to a share because he affords protection and because he is lord of the earth. This militates against the view that the king is the owner of all lands, sinoe, if that were so, Manu would have declared that the king took all the mines and treasure found in & oultivated field. In VIIL 243 Manu prescribus & fine for a oultivator not oultivating his field at the proper time or allowing the crops to be eaten up. But this would not make the king the owner, since the fine is imposed because the king is deprived of his share of taxes by the action of the cultivator. All these passages show that Manu held that the ownership of erable land was in the oultivator himself and the king was only entitled to demand a certain share of the produce (which is designated bhaga or kara as in Manu VII. 133). This is further supported by the conduct and practioe of powerful but good kings who purchased lands from their holders when they wanted to donate lands already cultivated. It may be conceded that land that was waste or not cultivated by anybody was deemed to belong to the king. Manu (VII. 115-119) enjoins that the king should appoint a headman for a village and officers for ten, 20,100 and a thousand villages, that each of the preceding one was to report to the officer next above him about crimes and other matters, that the headman of a village was to take for his livelihood the perquisites (such as food, fuel &c.) that tbe king could daily demand from the villagers, and that the other officers were to be remunerated by grants of plots of land (which when first granted must have been un cultivated). Kaut. II. 1 states that land prepared for cultiva. tion may be granted to cultivators who will pay a tax for life, that lands may be confiscated from those who do not cultivate them and may be given to others, that lands bestowed upon superintendents, accountants and similar persons 88 remunera. tion cannot be sold and mortgaged by them. For want of space this subject oannot be further pursued here. In modern times opinion has been sharply divided on the question whether the revenue from the land is in the nature of rent or is a tax. Baden Powell in 'Land Systems of British India' vol. I, pp. 240, 280 holds that land revenue is not rent but is a tax. In an elaborate judgment delivered by Sir Michael Westropp C. J. after exhaustively reviewing the original sanskrit texts (pp. 30-39 ) and the works and reports of famous statesmen and writers such 88 Elphinstone, Munro, Mill and Wilson (pp. 39-53) the conclusion arrived at is stated to be that the proprietary

right of the sovereign derives no warrant from the ancient laws or institutions of the Hindus and is not recognized by modern Hindu lawyers as exclusive or incompatible with in dividual ownership' (p. 53 ). 2026 

The word agrahāra has been applied to the grant of lands or villages to brāhmaṇas from very ancient times. It occurs frequently in the Mahābhārata e. g. Vanaparv& 68. 4, Asrama vāsiparva 2.2, 10. 41, 13. 11, 14. 14, 25. 5. Vide E. I. vol. I, p. 88 (grant of the Valabhi king Dhruvasena III, in G. 9, 334 i. e. 653-654 A. D.) and in the Madhuban copper-plate of Harsa dated in the 25th year of his reign (i. e. 631, A. D., E. I. vol. I, p. 73 and VII at p. 158). 

Gifts of certain kinds are called Mahādānas. According to the Agnipurāna 2037 ( 209. 23-24) the Mahādānas were ten, viz. gifts of gold, horses, segame, elephants, maids, chariots, land, house, & bride, and a dark-brown ( kapila ) cow. The Mahādānas are, however, usually enumerated as 16 in the puriņas (vide Matsya, chap. 274-289, Agni, chap. 210, Linga purāpa II, chap. 28 ff). The sixteen mahādānas are: Tula. puruşa (weighing & person against gold or silver which is then distributed among brāhmapas), Hiranyagarbha, Brah māņda, Kalpavěkşa, Gosahasra, Kamadhenu (or Hiranyakama dhenu ), Hiraṇyāsya, Hirapyāśvaratha (or simply Asvaratha), Hemahastiratha (or simply Hastiratha ), Pañcalāngala, Dharma dana (or Haimadharādāna), Vibyacakra, Kalpalatā (or Maba. kalpa- ), Saptasāgara, Ratnadhenu, Mahābhūtaghata. In the Lingapurāna (Uttarārdha, chap. 28 f) the names are somewhat different. The names of these Mahādanas (of some at least) go back to centuries preceding the Christian Era. The word 'Mahādānāni' occurs in the Mahābhārata (Asramavāsi-parva 3. 31, 13. 15). In the Hathigumpha Inscription of Khāravela (2nd century B. C.) Kalpavškşa appears to be mentioned (E. I. vol. XX. p. 79). Bāņa often refers to Mabādānas in general and Gosahasra in particular. 2038 It has already been shown (on

( Ch. XXV 

p. 856 ) how Uşavadāta made extensive gifts some of which fall under mabādānas. The Tulāpuruşa is very frequently spoken of in the Epighraphio records. The Cambay plates of the Rāştrakūta king Govinda IV (dated sake 852) state that the king was weigbed against gold (E. I. vol. VII. p. 26). Vide also E. I. vol, XI p. 112 (in Dantivarma Ins. of sake 675), E. I. vol. IX, P. 24 (Rāstrakūta Indrarāja III weighed against gold in sake 836), E. I. vol. XI, p. 20 at p. 23 (Hematula of Govindacandra mentioned in sarn. 1186), E. L vol. XIV, p. 197 (dated sam. 1156, when 32 villages were given as dakşiņa after the two mah.. dānas of tulāpuruşa and gosahasra); E. I. vol. VII, p. 17 (refers to tulāpuruşa of Krşņarāya of Vijayanagara in sake 1437). The tulādāns is mentioned in the ancient Tamil work Silappadi kāram (vide p. 311 of Prof, Dikshitar's translation). In E. I. vol. XII, at p. 10 it is stated that king Lakşamanasena of Bengal granted a village as dakşiņā when he performed the Mahādāna called Hemāśvaratha. The Sanjan plates of Amogbavarşa (dated sake 793) speak of the Hiranyagarbha mahādāņa per formed by Danti-durga at Ujjayini (E. I. vol. XVIII, pp. 235,238). In the Srirangam plates of Deparāya II of Vijayanagara dated sake 1350 it is stated that the prince gave & dinner to one lakh of brāhmaṇas at the holy place or Prayāga (modern Allahabad) and on a lunar eclipse performed the Panca-la ngala vrata (J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. XIII, p. 1 at p. 3). 

Brief notes will now be added for setting out the procedure of the mahādānas. The Matsya-purāņa (chap. 274–289) devotes about 400 verses to these. Aparārka ( pp. 313-344) not only quotes almost all these verses of the Matsya-purāņa, but also adds further details from the Bhavişyottara-purāņa in certain cases. Hemādri ( Dapakhanda pp. 166-345 ) is far more elabo rate and quotes ( in addition to the Matsya ) long passages from the Linga, Garuda and other purāņas and from works on Tantra and the Agamas. The Dānamayükha devotes pp. 86-151 to the 16 mabādanas. The Matsyapurāņa ( 274. 11-12) states that the mabādānas were performed by suoh anoient beroes and kings as Vasudeva, Ambarisa, Bhargava, Kārtavirya Arjuna, Rāma, Prablada, Pșthu and Bharata. It then gives general directions about the construction of the pandal(maņdapa) required in making these mabādādas. The maņdapa may be of various sizes, 16 aratnis (one aralni boing equal to 21 angulas of the donor) or 12 or 10 cubits ( one cubit being the length of the arm from the tip of the middle finger to the end

of the elbow), should have four doors and a vedi ( raised plat form ) of seven or five cubits prepared with bricks, there was to be an arch on the vedi for holding the balance, it should hayo nine or five kuņdas 2038 (pits in the ground for holding fire ) or one kuņda, two auspicious water jars were to be placed at esob door of the pandal, the tulā was to have two posts and & cross beam of the same wood ( such as aśvattha, bilva, palāša &c.) and was to be decked with golden ornaments. These details have to be passed over here for want of space. The rest of the procedure about tulāpuruşa is briefly as follows ( Matsya, chap. 274 ): Priests knowing the four Vedas were to be placed on the four sides respectively (viz. Rgvedins to the east, Yajurveding to the south, Sāmavedins in the west and Athar vapas in the north). Then four homas were to be offered to Ganesa, the planets, the lokapālas, the eight Vasus, the Adityas, the Maruts, to Brahmā, Vişnu, Siva, the sun and the herbs and Vedio hymns referring to these were to be recited. 

At the end of the homa, the guru invokes with flowers and incense the lokapālas (lords of the worlds or quarters ) with pauranika mantras, viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirsti, Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Ikāna, Ananta and Brahmi. Then the donor should give golden ornaments, ear ornaments, golden chains, wrista lets, rings, clothes to the priests and double ( what is given to each ytvik) to the guru. Brāhmaṇas should then recite the vedic hymn on śānti (propitiatary verses averting evil ).2010 Then the donor again bathes and clad in white garments and wearing garlands of wbite flowers and having flowers in his folded hands invokes the balance that is supposed to be Govinda (Vişnu), and after per-ambulating the balance, he should step 

2039. There is a work called Kugdarka by Sarkara, son of Nilaka otha, which in 15 stanzas succinctly gives all information about kuodas. They are of tea kinds, circular, lotus-like, creacent-shaped, yoni, trian gular, quadrangular, pentangular to ootagonal. The diagonal drawn from north-east to south-west may be one hasta, two hastas, four, 6 or oight according as the oblations to be offered are 1000 or more up to 10,000 or from 10,000 up to a lakb, or from a lakh up to ten lakhs (4 hastas ), from ten lakhs up to & crore (six hastas) and any number beyond a crore ( 8 bastas ). This extent is necessary for preventing the oblations from falling outside the kuqda. Kundas of different forms were employed according to tbe rites performed. Vide Hem&dri (dana, pp. 125–134 ) for further details.

into one pan and in the other pan brāhmaņas should place pure gold. Then the earth should be invoked and thereafter the donor should leave the balance and give half of the gold to the guru and the other half to the brahmanas, pouring water on their hands before doing so and he may also make grants of villages to the guru and other priests. Then he should honour brahmanas, other respectable people and the poor and helpless with gifts. One who performs this rite stays for innumerable years in the world of Vigņu. The same procedure was applied to weighing a man against silver or camphor (Aparārka p. 320, Hemādri, danakhanda p. 214). Apart from kings who got themselves weighed against gold as shown above, lesser persons such as ministers sometimes indulged in this mahadana, as Capdešvara, & minister of the Mithila kings, states with pride in his Viv&daratnakara (vide H. D. vol. I, p. 370 ). 

Hiranyagarbha :-( Matsya 275, Lingapurāņa II. 29). The preliminary procedure about the pandal, the time, place, the materials, the punyābavaoana, the invocation of the lords of quarters is the same in this and the other mahadānas as in tulapuruşd. The donor should then bring forward a golden kunda (basin or vessel ) 72 fingers high and 48 broad and having the shape of & muraja ( tabor) but looking like the interior surface of a golden lotus (with eight petals). The golden yesael ( it is called Hiranyagarbha ) should be placed on a heap of sesame. Then the golden vessel is to be addressed with paurānika mantras, identifying it with Hiranyagarbha 2041 (the Creator). He should then enter the golden vessel, sit facing the north, hold in his hands golden images of Brahma and Dharmaraja and hold his head for five breaths between his knees (to simulate the position of the foetus in the mother'a womb). The guru then repeats on the golden vessel the mantras of garbhadhana, pumsavana and slmantonnayana (and mentally revolves the other procedure of these ); the guru 

thereafter makes the donor rise out of the golden vessel to the accompaniment of auspicious musio. Then the remaining twelve samskāras are 4048 performed symbolically on the donor,

who repeats the mantra to Hiranyagarbha and says 'formerly I was born from my mother but only as a mortal, now being born of you I shall assume a divine body.' Then the donor, Beated on & golden geat, is bathed with the mantra 'devasya tvā' (vide above note 6538 ) and he distributes the golden vessel among the guru and other priests. 

Brahmānda:--(Matsya 276). In this dāna, two vessels (pans) of gold are to be prepared resembling the two halves of a hemisphere (to represent the dome of heaven above and the earth below). The two halves are to be made of gold weighing from 20 palas to a thousand according to the donor's ability and their length and breadth should be from 12 to 100 fingers; the pans should have (golden ) figures of the eight diggajas, the vedas and six angas, of the eight lokapālas and of brahmā in the middle of them, of Siva, Vişnu, the sun on their top, of Umā and Lakşmi, of Vagus, Adityas and Maruts inside ; the two should be covered with a silk garment and placed on a heap of sesame; eighteen kinds of corn should be arranged round them, Then in the eight quarters from the east golden images of Anantasayans (Visnu lying on the spake ), Pradyumna, Prakrti, Samkarşana, the four vedas, Aniruddha, Agni, Vasudeve should be respectively arranged. Ten jars covered with cloth should be placed near; gifts of ten cows with golden-tipped horns, with copper Vessels (for milking them) and covered with garments should be made and gifts of sandals, umbrellas, seats, mirrors should be made and the golden pans (called Brabmanda ) should be addressed in paurānika verses and the gold should be distributed to the guru and priests ( 2 parts to the guru and one part to each of eight priests ), 

Ralpapādapa or Kalpaurka :-( Matsya 277, Linga II. chap. 33). A golden tree is to be manufactured with several fruits hanging down from it and with many ornaments and clothes. The gold may be from three palas to a thousand acoording to one's means. From half of the gold the Kalpa pādapa is to be prepared and placed on a heap (prastha is a measure of 32 palas ) of jaggery, with images of Brahmā, Vişnu and Siva and the sun and five branches and the other four trees, Santana, Mandāra, Pārijātaka and Haricanda na are to be made each from of the one half of the gold taken and planted respectively in the east, south, west and north. Under the Kalpavřkşa, figures (golden) of Kamadeva ( the god of love) and his four wipes are to be placed. Eight jars filled

with water and covered with silk cloth and surrounded by lamps, obowries, umbrellas are to be arranged and 18 dhānyas 404? also; prayers are to be offered to the Kalpavşkşa to ferry the donor over the ocean of samsāra; then the kalpavrkņa is to be donated to the guru and the other four trees 8044 to four priests. Aparārka (p. 326 ) quotes Bhavisyottara to the effect that a sonless man or woman should make this mahādāna. 

Gosahasra:-(Matsya 278, Linga II. 38). The donor should subsist for three days or one day on milk alone and then the preliminary procedure of invoking lokapālas, punyābavā. cana, homa eto, should be gone through. Then fragrant substances should be applied to the body of a bull made to stand on the altar and ten cows out of 1000 should be selected. They should be covered with clothes, have their horns gold-tipped and the hoofs tipped with silver and these cows should be brought inside the pandal and honoured. A golden image of Nandikeśvara (Siva's bull) having golden bells round its neck, covered with silken cloth, scents and flowers, with horns gold tipped, should be placed in the midst of the ten cows. The donor should bathe in water that is medioated with the herbs called sarvausadhi 1045 and with flowers in his folded hands invoke the cows with mantras expressing the greatness of cows and address the image of Nandikesvara as Dharma and should bestow the golden image of Nandi on the guru with two Cow8 and donate one cow each to eight priests and to other brāhmaṇas five or ten oows each out of the remaining. The owner should then subsist on milk alone for one day and should be continent that day. The donor would dwell in the world of Siva and would save his pitrs and maternal grand-father and other maternal ancestors.

of the Sun. Yaj. (I. 201-205), Agnipurana 210. 30 presoribe that when making a gift of a cow, she should have the horns and hoofs tipped with gold and silver respectively, she should be accompanied with a bell metal vessel (for milking her) and she should be covered with cloth, she should be mild in tem per and the gift should be accompanied with a money payment and that whoever makes such & gift stays in heaven for 88 many years as there are hair on the cow's body. Vide Samverta Verses 71, 74-75 also. In the Anusasana-parvason (51. 26-34 and chapters 77, 78 and 81) there are frequent eulogies of cows. Anusasana 57.28-29 are just like Yaj. I. 204-205. Anusasana (83. 17-18) explains that the cow is & constituent element of sacrifice, that the cow nourishes men (with milk), that their progeny (the oxen) are useful in agriculture and therefore cows deserve the highest praise, Aparārka (p. 295-297) quotes numerous passages from the purānas eulogizing cow. Among cows kapila is the best for gift (Anusāsana 73.42 and 77.8). Anusasana (77. 10 ff) explains why the dark-brown cow (kapila) is the best. Yaj. I. 205 states that if the cow donated is kapila it saves (from sin) the donor's family up to seven generations (including himself). Aparārka p. 297 quotes Samvarta to the effect that the kapilā cow is equal to ten ordinary cows. The Varahapurana chap. 111 deals with the gift of akapila cow. The method of giving a cow is briefly as follows 2050 (Hemadri, Danakhanda p. 451 ff, Danamayākha pp. 185-186): The cow is made to stand facing the east together with her calf and is worshipped by the donor (after having bathed and tied his top-knot) who sits near the tail and the dones sits facing the north. The donor holds in his hand a vessel containing

clarified butter in which a piece of gold is put. The tail of the cow is dipped into the butter and then taken out and placed into the right hand of the doneo with the hair turned towards the east and also water, sesame and kusa grass are placed in the donee's right hand. The donor holds in his hand a vessel full of water from which he sprinkles water with paurānika mantras, gives dakşiņš and then the cow starts with the donee and the donor follows them a few steps and repeats certain verses eulogizing Cows. The Agnipurāņa (210,34) specially recommends that one who is at the door of death should make the gift of a cow (particularly a dark one) who would enable him to cross the blazing river in the world of Yama called Vaitarani ( and hence the cow is also called Vaitarani). 

Yāj. I. 206-207 ( 206 = Agnipurāņa 210. 33), Vişņu Dh. S. 88. 1-4, Vanaparva 200. 69-71, Atri 333, Varābapurāņa 112 4051 attach special importance to the gift of a cow when she is just on the point of giving birth to a calf (and therefore styled 'ubha yatomukhl) and the donor is said to stay in heaven as many years as the hair on the body of the cow and her calf. Apararka (pp. 299-301 ) quotes & long prose extract from Cyavana on the procedure of this gift. When the head of the calf has appeared, the donor should say to the worthy donee accept this cow for conferring a favour on me and not because you desire this gift' and repeat Rg. IV.19. 6. Then taking hold of the cow with the formula 'ka idam kasmā adāt' (Atharveveda III. 29. 7, Asv. Sr. 5. 13, Ap. Śr. 14. 11. 2 ), the donor takes down the call and recites in & loud voice Rg. IV. 27.1 ('garbhe nu'). Then after kindling fire the donor repeats mantras addressed to the gods, pitřs, rivers, mountains, plants, seas, serpents, herbs respectively viz. Rg. I 139. 11, X. 16. 12, X. 75. 5, IX, 75, 4, III. 8. 11, VII. 49. 1, VI. 75. 14, I. 90. 6. Then the donor should propi. tiate the Earth with mantras ( addressed to the Earth ) viz. Rg. I. 112. 1, I. 22. 13, I. 185.7, I. 164. 41; the donor should offer 84 oblations of clarified butter, feed brāhmaņas and receive

their benediotions in the terms of Rg. V. 51.11 'svasti no'). The gift of such a cow with the paraphernalia of gold or silver, fields, corn, clothes, salt and the like, søndal-wood, releases a man from the sins of eating or drinking forbidden food, brahmaņa murder, incest &c. 

In imitation of the gift of the cow gifts of certain articles were made and they are also described as dhenus. The Matsyapurāņa ( chap. 82. 17-22 ) speaks of ten dhenus viz. of guda (jaggery), gbrta ( ghee ), tils (sesame ), jala ( water ), kşira ( milk), madhu (honey ), sarkarā ( sugar), dadhi (curds ), rasa (other liquids) and godhenu ( cow itself ). It gives (chap. 82) a detailed des cription of gudadhenu and adds that the liquid dhenus should be kept in jars and others should be in heaps, that the same procedure applies to all, and that some add suvarpadhenu, navanita-dhenu (cow of butter) and ratnadhenu (cow of jewels). The Agnipurāna ( 210. 11-12 ) enumerates the same ten dhenus. In the Anusasana-parva 71. 39-41 the three dhenus of ghrta, tila and jala are mentioned. The Varāhapurāņa (chap. 99-110) describes in detail twelve dhenus, viz. all mentioned in the Matsya (except ghệta and godhenu) and nevenita, lavaņa (salt), kārpāsa ( cotton ) and dhānya ( corn). The procedure of all is more or less the same, Black antelope skin four cubits in length is to be spread on the ground that has been cowdunged and has darbhas strewn on it with the neck portion to the east (this represents the cow ) and a smaller skin is also spread (to represent the calf). If it is guda-dhenu it is made of % or 4 bharas 1088 and the calf is made with one fourth of that for the 

cow. Various articles such as conch shells, sugarcane pieces, pearls, ohowries, coral &o. are placed on the skin, to represent the various limbs of the cow, which is worshipped with dhūpa (incense ) and lamps and invoked with paurānika mantras. Then the articles are donated to a brāhmaṇa. Hemādri (Dana, p. 401 ) notes that according to the Padmapurāņa a single jar of liquids and one dropa of solids constitute these dhenus, while

the Danaviveka establishes that Kumbha 2058 is equal to 1000 palas and others hold that kumbha contains 512 palas. These several dhenus may be donated on eclipses, on the full moon days of Kartika and Māgha, on Yugādi days or when the 7th tithi of a month falls on a Sunday and that the donor should subsist for three days on the substance to be donated. Aparārks pp. 303-313, Hemādri ( Dāna. ) pp. 397-466, Danamayükha pp, 172-184 dilate upon these dhenus, but all those details are passed over here for want of space. 

It appears that on account of the high merit agaociated with the gift of cows, donors sometimes passed old and weak oows on to donees. The Kathopanişad I. 1. 3 appears to contain a condemnation of such practices.4054 " He who makes gifts of oows that simply drink water and eat grabs, but yield no milk and do not possess strength ( to conceive and produce calves ) reaches those worlds called 'anandaḥ '(without delights)." The Mahabharata (Anusigana 77.5-6) echoes the very words of the Kathopanişad. In the Apuśasana-parva 66.53 2058 it is said that one should not bestow on a brahmana a cow which is lean or is without her calf, which is barren and diseased, which is wanting in a limb or is exhausted. Hemādri (Dāna, pp. 448-449) quotes this and other passages of similar import that state that

the man who makes a gift of such a useless cow enters into the darkness of hell. 

The Matsyapurāņa (chap. 83. 92 ) speaks of ten kinds of dānas called parvatadūnas or merudānas, viz. of dbānya (corn ), lavana ( salt), guda ( jaggery), hems (gold), tila (sesame ), kārpāss ( cotton), ghrta ( ghee ), ratna ( precious stones ), rajata (silver ), sarkarā ( sugar). The Agnipurāna (210. 6-10) enume rates these ten. Aparārka (pp. 344-354) quotes all the chapters of the Matsya. Hemādri (Dāna, pp. 346-396 ) not only dilates upon these ten dānas, but speaks of 12 of such dānas from Saiva works like the Kālottara. These danas were called parvata, falla or acala because the substances were heaped up like hills. The procedure in all of them is the same. A square platform inclined towards the north-east or east was to be prepared, smesred with cowdung and strewn with kuģa grass. In the midst of it a heap was to be made to represent a mountain with smaller heaps to represent hills at the foot of the mountain. In the case of the mountain of dhānya, it is to be made with 1000 or 500 or 300 drona measures of corn. Three trees of gold are to be planted on the middle of it and in the four directions lotus like plants of pearls, gomeda and prişparāga, emeralds and sapphires, lapis lazuli respectively. Many more picturesque features such as gold and silver images of 81 gods are described in the Matsya. A guru snd four priests are to be chosen for home and 13 āhutis are to be offered to each of the gods. In the gift of salt, from 1 to 16 dronas thereof are to be employed, in the gift of jaggery from 3 to 10 bhāras, in that of gold from 1 to 1000 palas, in that of sesame from 3 to 10 dronas, of kārpāsa from 5 to 20 bhāras, of ghee from two kumbhas to 20, of ratnas from 200 pearls to 1000, with attendant hills of precious stones 

of the pearls, of cotton from 20 palas to 10 thousand, of sugar from half a bhāra to 8 bhāras. 

The smštis, purānas and digests speak of the gifts of many animals such as of elephants, horses, buffaloes, of articles like clothes, deer-skins, umbrellas, shoes, which are all passed over here. But two or three of these many dānas deserve notice. Aparārka (pp. 375-376 ) extracts a long passage from the Bhavişyottara about construoting in the month of Caitre a mandapa for the distribution of water to travellers in the midst of a city or in a waterless desert or near a temple. A brāhmana was to be engaged for wages to distribute water and this was to be continued for four months or at least three fortnights,

Dana-gifts of books 

883 

Another important gift is that of manuscripts of the epios, dharmaśāstras and purānas, Aparārka (pp. 389-403) and Hemādri ( Dāna, pp. 526-540 ) quote from the Bhavisyottara, 2058 Matsya and other purāņas long extracts about the merit secured by making such gifts, the Matsya in particular also stating the number of verses in each of the 18 purāṇas. The Agnipurāņa also in speaking of the gifts of Mss. of purānas states the number of verses in each (chap. 272). The Bhavisy8. purāņa states that books may be placed in a matha for the use of all people and that he who arranges for the reading of books in the temples of Siva, Vişņu or the Sun reaps the merit of the gifts of cows, land and gold. E. I. vol. 18 p. 340 records a gift to & temple in which provision is made for the reading of the Mahābhārata from a part of the income (in Kerala in the 11th century A. D.), The Agnipurāņa 211. 61 eulogises also the gifts of the works called Siddhāntas. 

In medieval and modern times gifts were and are made with a view to propitiate the planets. And this sentiment can be traced back to the days of the sütras. Gaut. 2057 XI. 15 advises the king to perform the rites that experts in astrology and in portentous signs might indicate (as necessary) for averting evil consequences and states (XI. 16 ) that according to some ācāryas the welfare of the king depends upon the performance of such rites. The Aśv. gs. (III. 12, 16) states that the purohita should direct the king to fight from the direc tion or side on which the sun is or (if fighting at night) from the side on which Venus shines (and not from a side opposite to them). Yāj. (I. 295–308) deals with Grahaśānti (propitiation of planets ). He states that he who desires prosperity, or the averting of calamities, or good rains, long life and health and also wants to harm his enemies by magic rites should perform & sacrifice; that the nine planets are the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu; that images

of the planets are to be made respectively of copper, crystal, red sandal-wood, gold (for both Mercury and Jupiter), silver, iron, load and bell-metal or they may be drawn on a piece of cloth in these colours or may be painted in circles on the ground with colours; that flowers and clothes may be offered to them of the respective colours described above; fragrant sub stances, incense of guggulu should be offered to them and oblations of cooked food may be made to them in fire with the following mantras respectively, viz. Rg. I. 35, %, Vāj. 8. 9. 40, Rg. VIII. 44. 16, Vāj. S. 15. 54, Rg. II. 23. 15, Vaj. 8. 19. 75, Rg. X. 9.4, Vāj. 8. 13. 20, Rg. I. 6.3. The fuel-sticks to be offered to the nine planets should respectively be of the following trees and plants: of arka plant, palāša, khadira, apāmārga, pippala, undumbara, sami, dūrva and kusa grass. 108 or 28 samidhs of each of these should be tbrown into the fire, they being anointed with honey, clarified butter, curds and milk. The foods on which the brāhmaṇas are to be regaled at dinner in the grahayajña are respectively rice mixed with jaggery, rice cooked in milk, havişya food (i, e. the food on which the ascetics live), corn that ripens in sixty days cooked in milk, curds, and rice, rice with clarified butter, rice mixed with crushed sesame, flesh (with rice), rice of various colours. The fee ( dakşiņa) to be paid should respectively be a milch cow, conch, & draught ox, gold, clothes, horse (white), dark cow, iron weapon, a goat. The rise and fall of kings depend upon the ( aspects of) planets and the existence and destruction of the world depend upon planets; therefore the planets should be honoured the most 'Says Yaj. I. 308. 

The Matsya-purāņa 8068 in chap. 93 contains a detailed procedure of grahasānti and chapter 94. (1-9) desoribes how the images of the nine planets are to be represented. Vide Vaik. IV, 13 and also Baud. gr. seşa-sutra I. 16 for a similar treatment. In modern times the danas ( artioles donated) to propitiate the nine planets are those stated in the 

2058. Tho mantras of the nine planets slightly differ in the Mateya-purana ( 93. 35-37) from those of Yøj. I. 300-301. Mataya 93. 89-63 names the same dakpinas 28 Yaj. and a pararka p. 675 quotes those versos. All the nine verses of Mataya 94 are quoted by the Mit. on Yoj. I. 297-98.

Dharmasindhu 8058 quoted below. The 8. R. M. (pp. 123-164) contains & long-drawn procedure of Grahamakha, & rite to propitiate the planets. A Grabamakha is either nitya (on Vişuva day, ayana day, birth nakşatra), naimittika (to be performed on suoh oocasions as upanayana) and kāmya (for removal of adversity &o.) 

Aparārka (pp. 365-366 on Yāj. I, 209) quotes a long passage from the Nandipurāņa about the founding of hospitals (ārogya. śālā ) where medicines were supplied free to patients. Since the four puruşārthas (goals of life ) viz. dharma, artha, kāma and mokşa, depend upon health, he who provides for securing this may be said to have made gifts of everything. The passage further states that a competent physician should be appointed. Hemidri (dana, pp. 893-95) quotes the same passage and another from the Skandapurāņa to the same effect. 

The smrtis prescribe that when & man docepts as a gift what he should not accept, he incurs sin from which he becomes free by giving up the thing, by reciting certain vedio mantras, (like the Gāyatri) and by tapas ( prāyasoitta ). Vide Manu XI. 193 ( = Vişņu Dh. 8. 54. 28). This sin is said to be due to *agat-pratigraba' which may arise either from the caste or actions of the donor (e. g. the donor may be a cāņdala or patita ) or from the time or place ( e. 8. taking a gift in Kuruksetra or in an eclipse ) or from the object given (such as a gift of wine or of an ewe, of the bed-stead of a deceased person or of the cow called 'ubhayatomukhi'). Yāj. III. 289 and Manu XI. 194 (=Vişņu Dh. S. 54.24) presoribe for asat-pratigraha the penance of staying in a cow-stable for one month subsisting on milk alone, observing complete celibacy, repeating the Gāyatri mantra 3000 times every day. The donor, in the above cases, may incur no sin, but the donee does. The Dānakriyakaumudi (pp. 84-85 ) quotes passages from several purāņas condemning the acceptance of gifts on the Ganges and other saored rivers and places, and the gifts of elephants, horses, chariots, the beds

and seats used by the dead, black deer-skin, the cow called ubhayatomukhi. The Danacandrika8060 quotes the Padmapurana to the effect that a brāhmana who is in great difficulty to main tain himself may accept a gift on the banks of the Ganges and other sacred rivers, but should himself make a gift of the 10th part of it and then he would incur no sin. 

We have already seen (pp. 838-39 ) how even in the Rgveda Various rewards are promised to those who make gifts of cows, horses, gold or clothes. The Tai. S. I. 8. 4. 1 makes it a matter of give and take between gods and man ( dhebi me dadāmi te ni me dehi ni te dadhe). The same sentiments and notions continued down to the latest ages and are re-inforced by further and very detailed promises of rewards for several kinds of gifts. Vas. Dh. 8. 29. 2-27, Vişnu Dh. S. 91-92, Samyarta verses 46-93 may be read in this connection. 

A gift once completed by acceptance is irrevocable. Yāj. II. 176 prescribes what is promised should be given and what bas been donated should not be taken back. Nārada 2081 ( Dattā pradānika, verse 8) declares that the price of goods ( delivered ), wages, what is paid for pleasure ( derived from dancers &c.), & gift made through affection, a gift made through gratitude ( for favours received ), money paid for a bride ( to her kinsmen ) and gifts for religious and spiritual purposes - these are given irrevocably. But a gift though promised was not complete and irrevocable in all cases. Gaut. V. 21 declares that a gift, though promised, need not be completed if the donee to whom it is promised is a person guilty of irreligious or improper conduct (such as visiting prostitutes ). Manu VIII. 212 is similar in import. Kātyāyana states2068 that if a man of his own free will promises a gift to a brāhmana, but does not carry out that promise, he becomes a debtor ( to that brāhmaṇs) in this world and the next. This means that a gift promised to a brāhmaṇa, though not completed by acceptance and delivery,

oould not be revoked and could be enforced in a court as a debt and the promisor fined for breach. 

Gautama states (V. 22 ) that the promises made by those who were carried away by rage or extreme joy or who were under a sense of dread or were ill or distressed or covetous or made by a minor (under 16 ) or an extremely old man or by one who is a fool (or under delusion) or was intoxicated or made by & lunatic may be revoked by them and in doing so they incur no sin or blame. Nārada 2083 (Dattāpradānika, verses 9-10) amplifies this by stating 16 kinds of invalid gifts, viz. all those in Gautama (except those due to joy and covetousness ) and also what is promised as a bribe, promises in jest, giving to a person mistaking him for another, gift induced by fraud or made by one who is not his own master, gift made to a man with the idea of getting something in return ( but who does not do so ), gift to a person who is unworthy, though he proclaimed himself to be worthy, and a gift for a purpose which is sinful. Kātyāyana ( quoted by Aparārka p. 781 ) is just like Nārada and adds that if a man is in danger of life and promises the gift of all his wealth to whosoever may save him, he may resilo from the promise. Aparārka p. 782 quotes verses from Bșhas pati similar to Nārada's. Manu VIII. 165 declares that & sale, mortgage or gift brought about by fraud, or every transaction in which a trick is played, may be set aside (by the king ). Though a gift made by one who is ill or distressed (ārta ) is declared by Gautama to be revocable, Kātyāyana 2004 states an exception viz. that when a man whether in sound health or suffering from a disease declares a gift for religious purposes and dies without completing it, then his son (or other heir) should be inade to carry out that gift. This verge contains the germ of the idea of wills, since the mere deolaration of the intention of a man to make a gift for religious purposes is here

In modern times & gift or bequest for dharma without any qualifying expression is held to be too vague an indication of the donor's or testator's intention to constitute a valid gift to charity and is declared to be void for uncertainty. Vide 6 Bom. 24, 14 Bom. 482,17 Bom. 351,23 Bom. 725,735 (P. C.). But this is opposed, as pointed out in 30 Mad. 340 at pp. 342-346, to the spirit of the ancient Hindu law. The word 'dharma' when used in relation to gifts had a well-recognized meaning and not a vague uncertain one. It means 'iqta' and 'pūrta' gifts according to Manu IV. 227. It appears that in 23 Bom. 725 their Lordships of the Privy Counoil rested content with the meaning of the word given in Wilson's Dictionary, did not examine any original Sanskrit texts to find out the meaning of the word dharma used in connection with gifts and applied the principles laid down in such English cases as Morice v, The Bishop of Durham (9 Ves. 399 and 10 Ves. 522). But there is no reason why the charitable intention being quite clear the court as representing the king should not have by framing a scheme applied the property donated or bequeathed to one charitable purpose out of the several objects specified in the definition of pūrta on principles analogous to the dootrine of cy-près. 2065

CHAPTER XXVI 

PRATIŞTHA AND UTSARGA 

Pratistha and Utsarga (foundation of temples and dedica. tion of wells, tanks, parks &o, for the benefit of the publio). 

The subject of gifts naturally leads on to the topics of pratiştha and utsarga. We saw above (p. 157 f. n. 370) how the construction of temples, wells and similar religious and charitable foundations and institutions was included under pürtadharma and how sūdras were entitled to perform such dharma, The Mit. on Yāj. II. 114 points 8068 out that women (and widows) were entitled to spend on pürta objects, though they were not authorized to perform işta dharma (i. 0. vedio sacrifices &o.). Modern decisions have gone so far that a Hindu widow whose powers of alienating for secular purposes property inherited from her husband are very limited has been held to possess greater powers of alienation if the alienation be made for the spiritual benefit of her deceased husband and dedications by ber of a small fraction of the property for the continuous benefit of the soul of the deceased owner have been upheld..067 Such works of public utility have been highly recommended from very ancient times. Sabara 2008 on Jaimini I. 3. 2 refers to the smrti rules about charitable objects which are based on such śruti passages as 'O Agni, who art ancient and a king, thou art to the man who desires to offer a sacrifice like prapā (shed where water is distributed to travellers) in a desert'.

Rg. X. 107. 10 & puskariņi (& tank) is mentioned. The Vişnu Dh. 8. (obap. 91. 1-2) states 'one who digs a well (for the publio) has (the consequences of) half his sins destroyed when the water has begun to flow forth; one who dedicates & pond is forever happy (free from thirst ) and attains the world of Varuņa,' Bapa in his Kadambari ( para 44 ) 2009 mentions that amstis enjoined upon mon the foundation (for public use) of halls, shelters, wells, prapūs, gardens, temples, embankments, water wheels &o. Some sages went so far as to say that the reward of sacrifices is only heaven, but by pārta ( consecration of temples, tanks and gardens) one secures release from samsāra.2070 This shows that charitable works for the use of the public or large sections of the public came to be regarded as more meritorious than sacrifices the gifts in which benefited only brāhmaṇas. 

From very ancient times the procedure of dedicating a well or tank to the public has been settled. Among the earliest is the one in the Sankhyāyana gp. V. 2 (S. B. E. vol. 29 pp.134-135) which is as follows: Now about the censecration of ponds, wells and tanks. In the bright fortnight or on an auspicious tithi (day) having cooked a caru (boiled food) of barley in milk he (the donor) should sacrifice with the two verses tvam no agne' (Rg. IV. 1.4-5) and with the verses'ava te bela' (Rg. I. 24. 14), 'imam me varuņa'(Rg. I. 25. 19), 'uduttamam Varuna' (Rg. I. 24. 15), 'imam dhiyam' (Rg. VIII. 42.3) and with the words the domestic one, he who goes away from the house, the refreshing one, he who goes into the kennel, he who dwells in the kennel, he who comes out of it, the greedy one, the destroyer of enemies' to the different directions beginning with the west (Vāruņi, one over whioh Varupa presided) from left to right. In the centre he makes oblations with milk with the verses 'visvatas cakşuruta' (Rg. X. 81. 3), 'idam Visnur ( Rg. I. 22, 17 ); he plunges into the water with the verge 'gat kim cedam Varuna' (Rg. VII, 89. 5). 2071 A cow and a pair of

2071, Eyon in the e. g. Rg. in VII. 49. 3 (yasam raja varupo yati madbye) Varaja is the lord of wators and therefore it is appropriate that in dedioating wells and tanks to the pablio Varupa should bo invoked in lavoral versos.

The Asv. gr. pariĝişta IV. 9, Pār, gr. parigişta, Matsya. purāna chap. 58, Agnipurāņa chap. 64 contain a more extensive procedure about the dedication of wells and reservoirs of water. That in the Pār. gļ, parisista is briefly as 8074 follows: "In the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half, on an auspicious day, tithi, vāra ( week day), nakşatra and karana the donor should cook caru sacred to Varung of barley, offer the two djyabhāgas and sacrifice in fire ten oblations of clarified butter with the mantras, Rg. IV. 1. 4, IV. 1. 5, I. 25, 19, I. 24. 11, Kat. śr. 25. 1. 11 (ye te satam Varuņa ), ayāścāgne (Kat. śr. 25. 1. 11), Rg. I. 24. 15, Rg. I. 24. 8, Vāj. S. IV. 36, Vāj. S. VIII. 24.2073 He then sacrifices ( ten oblations) of the mess of cooked food to Agni, Soma, Varuņa, Yajña, Ugra, Bhima, Satakratu ( Indra ), Vyuşți ( prosperity ), Svarga ( Heaven) and lastly to Agni Svistakst ( with svāhā at the end of each as in "agnaye svāhā'). After partaking of the remains of the cooked food he should introduce aquatic animals (like fishes and tortoises in the pond &c. ) and having bathed and decked a cow he should make the cow enter the reservoir, repeat the Puruşa sākta ( Rg. X. 90. 1-16 ) and donate that cow to the ācārya and should also make presents to him of two ear-rings, clothes and of another cow as fee and give a dinner to brāhmaṇas." Aparārka (p. 413-414), the Nirnayasindhu and others add from the Bahvịca gf. parisista that when the cow enters the water, he should repeat a mantra 'may you make this water holy: may the water always be pure, holy and ambrosia-like; while saving me ( from sin) may you bathe in sacred water; she crosses from 

region to region and also saves (me and others)'; and that the donor holds the end of the cow's tail, enters the water and brings her out in the north-east corner (of the reservoir). This procedure

does not apply to the consecration of a well. In that case a cow is only made to go round the well. 

Gradually the procedure prescribed in the purānes came to have the upper hand so much so tbat Aparārka (p. 15 ) says that in pratisthā the procedure prescribed in the purāpas has to be followed and no other. 2074 

Aparārka (pp. 409-414), Hemādri (Dāna pp. 997-1029), Danakriyakaumudi (pp. 160-181 ), Jalāsayotsarga-tattve of Raghunandana, the Pratişthāmayükha and Utsargamayūkba of Nilakantha, Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 171-223) and several other works give a very comprehensive procedure of the con Becration of wells, ponds and tanks, based upon the gļhya parisistas, the purāṇas such as the Matsya chap. 58, the Tantras, Pāñcarātra and other works. This procedure is passed over here. The idea 2075 was that unless the reservoir was consecrated in the way prescribed its water was not holy and when consecrated it became holy. Pratişthā generally means dedicating to the public with prescribed2078 rites. Utsarga means 'divesting one self of ownership over a thing and dedicating it for the use of all.' There were four principal stages in the procedure of pratişthā; first the sankalpa,2077 then the homa, then the utsarga (i. 8. declaration that the thing has been dedicated) and lastly the dakşinā and feeding of brāhmaṇas. In Deosaran Bharthi v. Deoki Bharthi 3 Patna 842 it was said ( at p. 850 ) the essential ingredient that constitutes a gift whether of movable or of immovable property in the Hindu Law is the Sankalpa and the Samarpana whereby the property is completely given away and the owner completely divests himself of the ownership in the

property'. In the case of temples, the proper word to use is pratiştha and not utsarga. 

There is a difference in the technical meaning of dāna and utsarga. In the former the donor gives up his ownership over a thing, makes another the owner of it and cannot thereafter use it nor has he any control over it. When a man makes an utsarga, he no doubt gives up his ownership, but be gives up the thing for the benefit of all (as in the formula above be uses the word sarvabhūtebhyah') and so the opinion of most writers is that he can as a member of the public make use of the thing dedicated by him, though there were a few authors who recom mended that he should not do so.3077a 

Reservoirs of water that are dug out by man are of four kinds, kūpa, vāpi, puskariņi and tadāga.2078 Some of the works define kūpā as a well that is from five to fifty oubits in length ( if rectangular) or in diameter (if it is circular). It has generally no flight of steps to reach the water. Vāpi is a well with a flight of steps on all sides or on three or two sides or one side only and its mouth may be from 50 to 100 cubits; & puskariņi is from 100 to 200 oubits in length or diameter and a tadāga (a tank) is from 200 to 800 oubits. The Matsyapurāna 154.512 states that a vāpi is equal to ten kūpas ( in merit) and & hrada (deep reservoir ) is equal to ten vāpss ; a son is equal to ten hradas and a tree is equal to ten sons. According to the Vasiştha-samhitā quoted by Raghunandana a puskariņi is up to 400 oubits and a tada ga is five times as much. At certain auspicious times only the consecration of wells and tanks is to take place.8079

which the sacrificial animal was tied ), for idhma (samidhs which were thrown into fire), for the several ladles like sruva, juhü eto. The Tai. Br. I. 1. 3 speaks of seven holy trees. The Tai. S. III. 4. 8. 4 states that idhma ( samidhs ) should be of tbe nyagrodha, udumbara, aśyattha and plakņa trees, as they are the abodes of Gandharvas and Apsarages.2080 Besides trees with their verdant foliage looked beautiful and tbe leaves of some of them ( such as the mango tree) are hung up even now in pandals and at entrances of houses as auspicious in marriage and other ceremonies. Hemādri cites a passage from the Brahmapurana that the twigs and leaves of the Asvattha (the pipal tree), udumbara, plakşa, cüta (mango) and nya grodha are styled pañcabhanga 2081 and are auspicious in all rites. The palasa tree was held to be so sacred that one was not to make seats, sandals or tooth brush from it or its branches and twigs ( Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 25). Trees gave shelter against heat and also yielded flowers and fruits (for worship of gods and pitts). When felled their wood was useful in building houses, for making implements of husbandry and for produoing heat and warmth. In his 7th Pillar Ediot (of Delhi-Topra ) Asoka mentions the construction of wells at a distance of 8 krosas and the planting of banyan trees and mango groves (C. I. I. vol. I pp. 134-135 ). The Mahābhāşya (vol. I. p. 14 ) quotes a portion of an ancient verse which conveys that if & person waters and tends mango trees, his pitss feel extremely pleased.2048 Manu IV. 39 and Yaj. I. 133 require the anataka to circumambulate well-known trees (like asvattha ) if he meets them on tbe way. The Kadambari also refers to this practice of worsbipping trees, particularly by women desiring to have & son,8083 The Mahābhārata (Anuśāsanaparva 58. 23-32 ) highly eulogizes plant life and divides plants into six kinds viz. víkşa (tree), lata (creepers that oling to trees), valli (creepers that spread on the ground ), gulme (bushes ), tvaksāra

(troes whose bark is strong, while the inside is hollow, like bamboos ) and grass and adds that he who plants trees is saved (in a future existence) by them just as sons do and that they should be tonded like sons.2086 The Vişņu Dh.8.91.4 says the same thing. Hemadri (Dāna pp. 1030-31) cites a long passage from the Padmapurāņa how by planting different trees and plants like asvattha, agoka, tamarind, pomegranate and others a man secures such rewards ( respectively ) as wealth, removal of sorrow, long life, & wife, &c. Vğddha-Gautama (Jiv., part 2. P. 625) identifies the Aśvattha tree with Sri Krsna. The Mahābhārata (Santi 69. 42) forbids even the felling of the leaves of trees like the agvattha that have a platform 2085 built for them ( caitya). Śāntiparva 184. 1-17 graphically describes how trees bave life since they feel pain and pleasure and grow though cut. The Bhavişyapurāņa quoted in the Utsarga mayūkha (p. 16 ) states' he who plants either one aśvattha or one picumarda or one nyagrodha or ten tamarind trees, or the three trees i. e. kapittha, bilva and āmalaka or plants five mango trees would not see hell ( i. e. would not be condemned to bell for his sins ). 8086 The Matsyapurāns (chap. 270. 28-29 ) requires that to the east of the mandapa of a temple fruit-bear ing trees should be planted, to the south trees that contain milky sap, to the west a reservoir of water with lotuses therein should be constructed and to the north a flower garden and sarala and tāla trees. Vas. Dh. S. 19.11-12 prescribes that no one should injure (i. e, cut) trees that yield fruits and flowers except only for purpoges of oultivating the land 3087 ( and for sacrificial purposes, as laid down in Vişpu Dh. S. 51, 63). The Vişņu Dh. S. V. 55. 59 prescribes that the king should award the highest fine, the middling fine, or a fine of 100 kārşāpaņas or of one kārşāpaņa respectively against those who wrongfully out a tree bearing fruit or a tree that bears flowers, or who out creepers and shrubs or grass. 

Hemādri (Dana. pp. 1029-1055 ) deals at length with the planting of trees, the dedication of a garden and the merit

acquired by making gifts of various trees. The procedure of dedicating a garden is prescribed in San. gr. V. 3, Asv. gf. parisista IV. 10, the Matsyapurāpa 59, Agnipurāņa 70 and in many other works. It is modelled on the dedication of wells and tanks. The Matsyapurāņa expressly states that the prooedure of the consecration of a tank is extended to the con secration of everything, such as a prāsāda ( a large house or ball for public use), a garden &o., the only difference being that the mantras are different.8088 The procedure in Sān. gr. 1088 (V.3) is: Having established the sacred fire in that garden and having cooked a mess of food, the donor should sacrifice with the words ( Vişnave syāhā, Indrāgnibhyām svāhā, Visva karmape svāha ) and with verses Rg. III. 8. 6 ff. ( yān vo daro ), verse by verse. Then be recites over the garden the verge Rg. III. 8. 11 'Vanaspate satavalko vi roha.' The fee for the sacri. fioe is gold. 

Devatā-pratiştha- Consecration of an image in a temple). 

Though the dharmasūtras speak as shown above of images and temples, it strikes one as somewhat strange that none of the principal grbya and dharma-gūtras contains any procedure of consecrating an image in a temple, while in the purinas and some of the digests much space is devoted to the topic of devatā pratiştha. The Matsyapurāna in chap. 264 and the Agnipurāņa in chap. 60 and 66 deal with devatā pratişthā in general. There are special chapters in the purāņas on the consecration of the image of Vispu or of Siva or the Linga. It would be impossible to deal in any detail with all this matter. The worsbip of god can be done in two ways, viz without any outward symbol and with a symbol. The first is achieved by a prayer and offering oblations into fire; the second by means of images, But even image worshippers are quite conscious that god is pure consciousness (cit), is one without a second, is without parts and without a physical body, and that the various images

in which he is thought as in-dwelling are so imagined for the benefit of worshippers.2090 

The worship of god through the medium of images is again two-fold, viz. done in one's house and in a public temple. The latter is, socording to many works, the best and the completest, since it allows of the celebration of festivals and the performance of the varied items or modes of worship (upacāra). Private worship of idols in one's house has already been dealt with above (pp. 726-736 ) under Devapūją. Now the worship of images in temples remains to be dealt with. The esta blishment of images in temples is again of two kinds viz. calarca ( where the image can be lifted up, moved to another place ) and sthirārcā ( where the image is fixed on a pedestal or is not meant to be lifted up or moved ). The consecration of these two differs in certain details. 

Here numerous matters have to be considered. The principal matters to be attended to according to the Matsyapurāņa (264-66) are: the auspicious time for the consecration of an image, the erection of a maņdapa to the east or north of the temple, the erection of a vedi therein, erection of four toranas ( arched gates ) for the maņdapa, placing two auspicious jars at each of four gates filled with scented water and herbs and covered with mango leaves and white cloth, raising of banners all round the mandapa, worship of lokapālas (guardian deities of quarters ), ereoting another mandapa for bathing the image in, bringing the image and honouring the artizans, drawing lines on the image or linga with a golden needle to represent the lustre of eyes, the selection of a qualified sthapaka or ācārya and of from eight to 32 other priests (called mürtipa ); taking the image or linga to the mandapa meant for bathing the image, bathing the image to the accompaniment of music with pañcagavya mixture, with mșttikā (loose earth ), with holy eshes and water ; rendering it pure by repeating four mantras (viz. samudrajyesthā”, apo divyāḥ, yāsam raja and apo hi şthā, which are respectively Rg. VII. 49. 1-3 and X. 9.1); offering worship after the bath to the image with sandalwood paste and covering it with a garment ( with the verse' abhi vastra 'Rg. IX. 97.50), placing the image in a standing position with the mantrauttişths' (Rg. I. 40. 1); placing the image in & chariot with the verses

Lin Devotha is cow that 

that mostly vedio mantras were employed though a few pau rānika mantras also oocur. In medieval digests like the Deve pratişthatattva other elements were added from Tantra works. Special attention may be drawn to the fact that in the above procedure the word prāņapratisthā does not oocur in the Matsya. Raghunandana (in Devapratişthatattva) quotes Devipurāna to the effect that prāņapratisthā is done after touching the cheeks of the image with the right hand and that without this vivifica tion & mere image does not attain to the position of a deity worthy of worship. In the Devapratisthatattva, the Nirnaya sindhu, the Rājadharma-kaustubha and other works the prāņa pratistha is based on the 23rd chapter (patala) of the Sarada tilaka ( verses 72-76). The mantra is given below. 1001 

The Devapratisthataitva (p. 505) quotes the Hayasirsapaif. carātra to the effect that generally a brāhmaṇ& should officiate at the consecration of an image of Vişnu, but a ksatriya can officiate for a vaisya or a südra yajamāna and a vaisya may do for a südra yajamāna, but a sūdra cannot officiate, 

__In the Matsyapurana, the Agnipurana, the Nrsimhapurana, the Nirnayasindhu and many other works there are descriptions of the consecration of the images of Vāsudeva, of a linga and other deities, which are all passed over here for want of space. In these works following Tantric practices three kinds of nyāsas viz. Mātrkānyāsa, Tattvanyāsa and Mantranyasa are referred to. The Mātýkānyāsa consists in repeating the letters of the alphabet from a ( including 'am' and 'ah') to 1 (in the form of akārāya

The Tattva nyāsa consists in repeating' Atmatattvāya namaḥ, svābā' and the same formula as to Ātmattvādhipati, Kriyāśakti, Śivatattva ( or Vişnutattva), Sivatattvādhipati, Icchāśakti, Vidyātattva, Vidyatattvādhipati, Adhāraśakti. The Mantranyāsa is as follows: taking a mantra of certain letters for a god ( e. 8. one of 12 letters as in'om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya ') one has to repeat each letter in the formula om omkārāya namaḥ svāhā'. 

The Dharmasindhu III (pārvārdha ) sets forth & brief procedure of the consecration of images in which only one priest is required ( vide pp. 333-34). In modern times also the prooedure of devatāpratişthā contains numerous elements and is extremely long. 

The Vaikhānasa Smartasūtra (IV, 10-11 ) contains perhaps the earliest extant detailed description of the consecration of the image of Vişņu. But it appears to have been mainly concerned with an image installed in private houses or with the worship of an image by one individual. It is briefly as follows: 2012 After the daily homa comes the daily worship of Vişnu, which (worship ) comprehends in itself the worship of all gods. A brābmaņa passage ( Ait. Br. I. 1) says 'Agni is indeed the nethermost ( or the lowest) among gods and Vişnu the highest; between these two stand all the other deities'. Therefore hav. ing established in one's house the bighest god Vişņu the house holder worships him at the end of the evening and morning homa. He should make an image of Vişnu in length not more than six fingers; he should perform its consecration in the bright half (of & month ) on an auspicious nakşatra. Three days before he should prepare the space ( kuņda ) of the gshya fire and perform the several rites of prokşaņa, drawing lines as described ( in Vaik. I. 9). Then he is to perform homa up to āgbāras ( as described above pp. 210–11). Then he performs the sacrifices to the limbs in the words 'to the teeth, svābā; to the jaws, svāha', and other oblations with the six mantras beginning with ato devā' (Rg. I. 22. 16-21). Then he performs while repeating audibly the hymn to Puruşa ( Rg. X. 90. 1-16) the opening of the eyes (of the god Vişņu ) with a golden needle. Having spread in a river or a pond or in a vessel filled with water oloth and kusa grass with the mantras beginning * ye te satam'(mentioned in Vaik. III. 17 ) he lays down (the

image of) the god on these with the head turned to the east and leaves the image there. On the second day after he bathes, he offers at night the Aghara in the usual way; he briage eight jars, fills them successively with panoagavya, ghee, ourds, milk, water mixed with whole rios, water with fruits, water with kusa grass, water with jewels ( pearls &c.); worships the god, bathes the image with the (contents of) the (eight) jars successively with the following mantras :'vasoh pavitram' (Vaj. S. I. 31 ).'agna dyabr', 'işe tvõrje tvā,' sam no devir," 8018 'catvāri sțnga' (Rg. IV. 58. 3), "somo dhenum' (Rg. I. 91.26 ), 'catvāri vāk (Rg. I. 164. 45 ), 'idam vispur' (Rg. I. 22. 17 ); he further bathes the image with perfumed waters to the accompaniment of the mantras āpo' (Rg. X. 9.1), 'biraṇya Varnah'(Tai. S. V. 6. 1.1) and the pavamana section. He then makes to the north of the fire & vedi ( altar ) with rice, places a seat on it, spreads cloth on it, places the god thereon and having decked (the image ) with clothes &o. worships the image. He has the benediction pronounced (by the brāhmaṇas), he touches the pratisara (a band or ribbon) with the svasti hymn2084 and ties it (on the right hand of the image ) with the mantra 'svastidā visaspatir' (Rg. X. 152, 2). He then lays the god down as before. After filling with purified clear water a jar that is not dark-coloured, he places it by the (right) side of the image, touches it with the syllable 'om' and throws into it a bunob of kuša grass, whole rice, a piece of gold and a jewel (pearl ). Having meditated on the god who is really without parts as residing in his own heart and also in the clear water, 88 golden in splendour, as having red face, eyes, hands and fest, as wearing the srivatsa mark and a yellow garment, as having ( in his hands ) the conch and the diso, as of benign countenance and as possessed of all parts (i. e, complete ) he should bow before him. Having sprinkled water round the fire and having lauded the work of the hots, he invokes the god by name in the southern prapidhi vessel in the words ' om bhūb purugam '(āvābagami) and performs invouations in the same way with vyāhrtis separately and together and of Nāriyaņa,

Vişnu, Puruşa, Satya, Aoyuta, Aniruddha, Sri, Mabi. Having poured out the rice ( for the sacrificial offering ) he sacrifices four times with ghee and with a hymn to Vişnu, with the Puruşagūkta (Rg. X. 90), with the mantras beginning with *ato devāḥ '( Rg. I. 22. 16-21 ) and with the mantra 'medini devi'; he should then offer the mess of boiled rice sprinkled over with clarified butter after invoking the god's names (Kesava and 11 others mentioned in Vaik. III. 13). On the following morning he bathes, placing the god in the standing position after uttering 'om'; carries the image with the jar while muttering the sakuna hymn (Rg. II. 42. 1-3 and IT. 43. 1-3) in the north Western direction into his house or in & temple or in the agnihotra-shed; placing down on the pedestal meant for the image jewels and gold he instals the image of Vişņu saying 'I install Vispu' wbile repeating a hymn to Vişnu and the hymn to Puruşa (Rg. X. 90). He makes a nyasa on the head, on the navel, on the feet and the chest of the image of the syllables syaḥ, bhuvaḥ and bhūh and om ; fixing his mind on the god with the mantra ' idam Vişnur'(Rg. I. 22. 17 ) and taking with a bunch of kusa grass the clear water that has been already poured in the jar and that has already the sakti (power personi. fied) in it, he makes ( the water) flow on the head of the image and performs the invocation with the words 'I invoke Vippu'. Having propitiated by worship as laid down in the sāstric rules he presents the sacrificial food ( to the image ). 

In Vaik. IV, 12 the daily worship of Vişpu is set out. 

The practice of attaching dancing girls to temples is of respectable antiquity. The origin of this practice appears to be analogous to the institution of Vestal Virgins in Rome. The Rajatarangipi (IV. 269) speaks of two dancing girls attached to a temple (detagshāsrite nartakyau) who danced and sang at a place as it was the custom of their family, though the temple itself was buried underground. In the Vaghli (Khandesh District) stone Inscription dated sake 991 ( 1069-70 A. D.) there is & grant of Govindaraja making provision for dancing and singing by damsels3045 ( vilāsini). In the Inscription of the Cahamāng king Jojaladeva dated sarvat 1147 ( 1090-91 A. D.) the courtezans of all temples are said to have been ordered to oome in their best dress and celebrate a festival with musio (E. I. vol. XI. 26 and 27 ) and the king records an imprecation

against all who might stop that practice. The Içtagi ( 20 miles east of Gadag) inscription dated 1112 A. D. records ( E. I. vol. XIII. p. 58 ) that a brāhmaps named Mahadeva donated houses for the retinue of dancing girls and other attendants of the gods at Ittagi. This practice of devadāsis (minor girls dedicated to the service of temples ) or, bhavns ( which term is known in the southern parts of the Ratnagiri district) was held by the modern Indian Courts to be immoral and whoever disposes of any person under the age of 18 years (or obtains possession of any person ) with intent that such person shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or with knowledge that the person is likely to be employed or used for any such purpose at any age is liable to be prosecuted under Seo. 372 and 373 of the Indian Penal Code (as amended by Act 18 of 1924 ),2086 In Bombay there is the Bombay Devadasis Protection Act (Bombay Act X. of 1934) which deolares the performance of ceremonies for dedicating an unmarried woman to an idol or temple illegal and renders the dedicator or abettor thereof liable to punishment ( one year's imprisonment or fine or both ). 

Punah-pratiştha:- Re-consecration of images in temples ). The Brahmapurāņa quoted by the Depapratişthātattve and the Nirnayasindhu says when an image is broken into two or is reduced to particles, is burnt, is removed from its pedestal, is insulted, has ceased to he worshipped, is touched by beasts like donkeys or falls on impure ground or is worsbipped with mantras of other deities or is rendered impure by the touch of outcasts and the like in these ten contingencies, god ceases to indwell therein.' When an image is polluted by (contact with ) the blood of a brāhmapa or by the touch of a corpse or the touch of 8 patita it should be re-consecrated. If an image is broken in parts or reduced to particles it should be removed according to sāstric rules and another should be installed in its place. When

an image is broken or stolen a fast should be observed. If images of metal such as of copper are touched by thieves or okndalas they should be purified in the same way in which polluted vessels of those metals are purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If an image properly consecrated has had no worship performed without pre-meditation (i.e. owing to forgetful ness or negleot) for one night or a month or two months or the image is touched by a südra or a woman in her monthly illness, then the image should have water adhivāsa (placing in water ) performed on it and it should be bathed with water from a jar, then with pancagavya, then it should be bathed with pure water from jars to the accompaniment of the hymn to Purusa ( Rg. X. 90 ) repeated 8000 times, 800 times or 28 times, worship should be offered with sandal-wood paste and flowers, naivedya (food) of rice cooked with jaggery should be offered. This is the way in which the re-consecration is effected. 

Jirnoddhāra (rehabilitating old or dilapidated temples &o.). This subject is closely connected with the preceding topic and is dealt with in the Agnipurāņa, chap. 67 and 103 ( about lingas); the Nirnayasindhu ( III. pūrvārdha p. 353 ), the Dharmasindhu (III. pārvārdha p. 335 ) give an extensive procedure following the Agnipurāņa. This is done when the image in a temple or a linga is burnt, or reduced to particles or is removed to another place. The Agnipurāņa (103. 4) says that if an image or linga is carried off by the strong current of a river, it may be re-consecrated elsewhere according to the rites prescribed in the gāstra. According to the Agnipurāņa 2017 ( 103. 21 ) a linga that is reputed to have been established by the asuras (like Ban.. sura ) or famous sages or by gods or by those who were expert in Tantra should not be removed to another place, whether it be worn out or broken, even after the performance of prescribed rites. The Agnipurāna presoribes (chap. 67. 3-6) that an image of wood when extremely worn out may be burnt, one of stone may be thrown into water, one made of metal or of a jewel ( pearl &o.) should be thrown into very deep water or the sea after carrying it covered with oloth in a cart to the accompani ment of musio and on the same day another of the same dimen. sions and substance should be installed after the purification of the image is effected.

had been stopped of set purpose or when it is touched by gūdras and the like, purification can be effected only by re-conseora tion. Re-consecration can be done even in intercalary months or when Venus is too near the sun to be visible. When a temple or a well or a tank is breached or when & garden embankment or a public ball is injured, one should offer four oblations of clarified butter with the four verses 'idam Viņpur' (Rg. I. 22.17), 'ma nastoke' (Rg. I. 114.8), ' Vişņoḥ karmāņi' (Rg. I. 22. 19), pādosya'( Rg. X. 90.3), and then a dinner may be given to brāhmaṇas. 

The procedure of jirnoddhāra is given at length in the Nirnayasindhu, the Dharmasindhu and other works. Vțddbe Hārsta IX. 409-415 also deals with re-consecration. Sankhe Likhita quoted in the Vivāda-ratnākara and other works bay that, when an image, & garden, a well, a bridge (over & moat or river), a flagstaff, a dam, a reservoir of water are breached, they should be repaired ( or raised ), re-conseorated and the person guilty of breach should be fined 800 panas.2008 When worship was stopped, some authors presoribed re-consecration, while others prescribed only prokşaņa as laid down in the Devapratisthā tattva ( p. 512) or Dharmasindhu ( III pārvārdha p. 334 ). 

The Kirādu (Jodhpur ) Inscription of the time of king Bhimadeva of Anahillapātaka records that in place of an image broken by Turuşkas (Moslems ) a new one was installed in samvat 1235 ( 1178-79 A. D.) by the wife of Tejaḥpala, a sub ordinate officer of the feudatory Cāhamāna Mahārājaputra Madanabrahma ( vide E. I. vol. XX, Appendix p. 56 No. 381 ). 

Mathapratisthā (the founding of a monastery or a college for teachers and pupils.) 

The founding of mathas appears to bave been not very anoient. The Baud. Dh, S. (III. 1. 16) in speaking of a householder who is an agnihotrin remarks after departing from his house he (the householder) stops at the extremity of the village, builds there a hut (kuţi), or a cottage ball (matha ) and enters it'. Here maths does not appear to have any technioal senge. In the lexicon of Amara a matha is defined as'a place where pupils (and their teacher) reside'. A temple

and a matha were both established from the same religious motive or sentiment, but they served different purposes. A temple was built principally for the purpose of prayer and worship. It also often provided for religious instruction, for the recitation of the Mahābhārata, the Rāmāyana and the purāņas, for kirtans to the accompaniment of music. But these latter were only secondary purposes. In the cage of the mathas they were primarily intended for the instruction of pupils or the laity by some great teacher in the tenets of & sect or in the doctrines of some philosophy or in some branch of learning such as grammar, mlmāmgā, astronomy and the like. In many casos shrines or temples are associated with or affiliated to the mathas, but the worship of a particular deity is not the primary 

object of mathas. Mathas among the followers of the Vedio religion probably owed their origin to the example of Buddhist monasteries ( vihāras ) 3098 The foundation of mathas received & great fillip after the times of the celebrated Advaita teacher, the great Sankarācārya, whom tradition credits with having established for the propagation of his system of Vedānta four mathas at Sțngeri, Puri (Govardhanamatha), Dvārakā (sāradā. matha ) and Badari (Jyotirmatha ). Vide E. C. vol. VI Sg. No. 11 (an inscription dated 1652 A. D.) where reference is made to a grant in Sțögapura, the dharmapitha established by Sankarācārya, to the famous matha at Spāgers for the worship of Mallikārjuna, Vidyā-sankara-gyāmi and Saradāmbā. Other āoāryas like Rāmānuja and Madhva established their own mathas and the number of mathas is now legion. Originally & matha started by a sannyāsin like the great Sankarācārya must have had no property, as ascetics were prohibited by the sõstras from possessing property, except such articles of personal use as clothes, sandals, religious books on paim leaf or paper &c. Besides sannyāsins were required not to stay long in one place. So people built shelters for them, in order to scoommodate them when they visited their town or village and these were probably originally called matha, which in its narrow senge means a place where an ascetio resides. In its wider sense it means an institution where a teacher presides and instructs several disciples in religious and ana logous tenets, practices and dogmas. But gradually the zeal and devotion of the disciples and followers of the great

teachers endowed the mathas with considerable moveable and immoveable properties. The origin of mathas (spoken of as mattams in South India ) has been lucidly set forth as follows in Sammantha Pandara v. Sellappa Chetti 2 Mad. 175 at p. 179's preceptor of religious doctrine gathers around him a number of disciples whom he initiates into the parti cular mysteries of the order and instructs in its religious tenets. Such of these disciples as intend to become religious teachers renounce their connection with their family and all olaims to the family wealth and as it were affiliate themselves to the spiritual teacher whose school they have entered. Pious persons endow the schools with property which is vested in the preceptor for the time being and a home for the school is created and & mattam constituted. The property of the mattam does not descend to the disciples or elders in common; the preceptor, the head of the institution, selects from among the afiliated disciples him whom he deems the most competent and in his own life-time instals the disciple so settled as his successor, not unoommonly with some ceremonies. After the death of the preceptor the disciple so chosen is ins talled in the gaddi and takes by succession the property which has been held by his predecessor. The property is in fact attached to the office and passes by inheritance to no one who does not fill that office. It is in & certain sense trust property ; it is devoted to the maintenance of the establishment, but the superior has a large domain over it, and is not accountable for its management nor for the expenditure of the income, provided he does not apply it to any purpose other than what may fairly be regarded as in furtherance of the object of the institution. Aoting for the whole institution he may contract debts for purposes connected with his mattam and debts 80 contracted might be recovered from the mattam property and would devolve as a liability on his successor to the extent of the assets received by him'.

Temples and Mathas 

909 

The head of a matha is called svami, mathapati or matha dhipati or mahanta (usually written as mohunt in the Law Reports ). The head of the mathe is usually appointed accord ing to the custom and practice of each matba, generally in one of three ways, viz. (1) the head for the time selects from among his disciples a fit one to succeed him, (2) the disciples elect one from among themselves to succeed on the demise of the head, (3) the ruling power or the original founder or his heirs appoint the head when there is a vacanoy. 

Tbat temples and mathas have throughout the centuries been supplementary to each other, both ministering to the reli gious and spiritual wants of the people can be shown by a few examples. It has been seen how Bāna ( in the seventh century) refers to the recitation of the Mahābhārata in the temple of Mabākāla at Ujjayini, The Rājatarangiņi ( V. 29 ) states how king Avantivarman of Kashmir appointed one Rāmata Upā. dhyāya to the post of expounder (vyākhyātrpadaka) of grammar in a temple ( about 900 A. D.). The Agnipurānatol enjoins that in a temple of Siva or Vişņu or the Sun if any one reads a book he may thereby acquire ( the merit of) the imparting of all knowledge. Some mathas on the other hand provided for Instruotion not only in spiritual knowledge but also in secular knowledge. In the Patna Inscription of the time of the Yadava king Singhana, we read that Cangadeva, the court astronomer and astrologer, established in sake 1128 ( 1207 A, D.) & matha for the study of the Siddhanta-širomani (an astronomical work) of Bhaskarācārya, the grandfather of Cangadeva (E. I. vol. I. p. 338 ), the matha being endowed with lands and other sources of income by two feudatories of Singhaņa. Vide also E. O. vol. VI. Sg. No. 11 referred to above (p. 907) where in endowing the matha at Sțngeri provision was made for the worship of Mallikārjuna and Sāradāmbā. 

A passage quoted in the Dānacandrikā from the Skanda. purapa states that & mathe should be provided with cots and beats, should be tbatohed with grass and provided with platforms and should be donated to brāhmaṇas or ascetics at some auspi cious time ; by so doing a man secures all his desires and if he has no worldly desires he secures release (from samsāra ).3103

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Ch. XXVI 

The word mațba was sometimes used in the sense of a dharmaśāla, & place provided for the temporary residence of travellers from distant parts. For example, the Rajatarangiņi VI. 300 states that queen Didda constructed ( about 972 A, D.) a matha for the residence of the people from Madhyadesa, Lāta and Saurastra. 

Throughout India for many centuries there have been well. endowed temples and mathas. But how the rulers or the ancient and medieval courts of justice regulated the administration of these institutions or their funds or how they prevented or stop ped maladministration or misappropriation is not dealt with exhaustively anywhere. 

In Girijanund Datta Jha v. Sailajanund Datta Jha 23 Cal. 645 it is observed as follows ( at p. 653 ) notwithstanding the existence of numerous richly endowed Hindu shrines all over India from the earliest times, the Hindu Law strictly so called is, as Sir T. Strange complains (see his Hindu Law, Ed. of 1839, vol. 1, p. 32) meagre in its provisions relating to religious endowments, a fact which may perhaps be accounted for on the supposition that the high reputation for piety and purity of character justly enjoyed for the most part by the priestly classes of ancient India who had the management of the shrines was deemed a sufficient safeguard against breach of duty, go as to render detailed rules of law to regulate their conduct unneces sary'. In the following some of the meagre material that oan be gathered from Dharmasastra works and analogous writings is set out. Manu (XI. 26 ) first appeals to the religious senti. ments of people by declaring that the wicked man who from 

greed seizes the property of gods or of brahmanas feeds in another world on the leavings of the food of vultures. Sabara remarks (on Jaimini'18 IX. 1.9) that when it is said that a village or field belongs to a god, that is not a literal expression but used only in a secondary sense. That is said to be owned by a person which one can use as one likes; a field or a village can not be used by a deity; but the attendants on the god ( or temple ) are maintained out of what is donated to a temple or god. From this it follows that all those rules that apply to a gift to a human being do not apply to a property dedicated to an

idol. Medhatithi ** (on Manu XI. 26 and II. 189) points out that images cannot be said to be owners in the literal sense, but only in a secondary or ideal sense, since the idol in a shrine cannot use the property at its will nor can it safeguard it and ownership consists in being able to use the thing owned as one desires and in being able to preserve it. In modern times courts in India have laid down that an idol is a juridical person capable of holding property, though from the vary nature of the case the possession and management of the property rests with a manager or a trustee. A matha is in the same position as an idol. The rights of the idol or of the maths can be safeguarded and vindicated in a court of law only by the manager or trustee of the temple or by the head (called mohunt) of the matha,2106 Vide Bhupati Nath v. Ram Lal 37 Cal. 128 (F. B.) at pp. 145-153 where Mr. Justice Mukerji examines at length passages of Sabara, Medbātithi, the Dayabhāga and its commentators to explain what is meant by a gift to an idol according to the notions of the Hindu writers. Manu and other smrtikāras lay down that it is part of the king's duty to prosecute and fine persons interfering with or destroying the property of temples. Yāj. II. 228 prescribes a fine of 40, 80 or 160 panas respectively for cutting off the twigs, principal branches of trees or the entire trees themselves that grow on built up platforms or in cemeteries or on boundaries or in boly places or near temples. Yaj. (II. 240 and 295 ) prescribes the highest ammercement for fabricating & false ediot or for tampering with royal edicts by inserting more or less than what is inten ded to be granted by the king. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 186 says that the king should sedulously safeguard all rules made about the pastures for cows ( in a village ) or about the preser vation of tanks and temples. Manu IX, 280 requires the king to pronounce the death sentence on those who break into a royal storehouse or an armoury or a temple and prescribes that the breaker of an image shall repair the whole damage and also pay a fine of five hundred paņas.

for encroachment on temples. From the Kautillya 1106 we know that kings appointed an officer called 'devatādhyakşa' (Superintendent of temples ) and that when the king's treasury became empty it was part of the duty of that officer to bring together all the wealth of the temples in the forts and other parts of the country and the king could in an emergency use that wealth (and probably used to return it later when financial stringenoy ceased). Among matters called prakirņaka (mis cellaneous) of which the king was to take cognisance suo motu without anybody's complaint, Nārada inoludes (in verse 3) * abstraction of gifts' and 'gifts of villages and towns to brāhmaṇas' (verse 2). According to the Sm. O. among the topics oalled chalas 1107 were two viz. the destruction of & reservoir of drinking water and of a temple. Katyāyang states that mere wrongful possession for any length of time of women, of state property and of temple property would not confer ownership on anybody. These texts indioated that the Government of the day protected temple properties, tanks, wells and the like that were dedicated to the public and exeroised powers of superin tendence and correction in matters affecting them. Yāj. IL 191 says that those who look after the business of guilds etc. in which many are interested should be students of the Veda, men of rectitude and free from greed. They are styled kārya. cintaka by him. Bphaspati \#108 quoted by Aparārka says (p. 796 ) that these kārgacintakas (committee ) should oonsist of two, three or five persons and that if there be disagreement between the larger bodies and the committee the king should decide that dispute and should bring round to the proper path whoever might be in the wrong. It appears that from very ancient times (3rd or 2nd century B. O.) the committee in charge of religious foundations was called goşthi and the

In the Sirpur Stone Inscription of Mahāśivagupta (about 8th or 9th century A. D.) of Mahākosala provision is made for a portion of the property granted being heritable by the song and grandsons of the donees only if they were worthy, kept up agnihotra. studied the six angas and had clean mouths and did not engage in service and further that if the heir did not possess these qualities or died without leaving & son &c., then another person, a relative with the requisite qualifications, could be made the recipient of that share, and he was to be elderly and learned and was to be chosen by mutual agree ment and the king's express order was not to be necessary for his selection. 3110 Paithinasi quoted by Aparārka p. 746 ordains that the king should not deprive temples and corpo rations of their properties. A record from Malabar of the 11th century A. D, gives the details of temple administration in Kerala, that was in the hands of Yogam ( corporation ) wielding independent power (E. I. vol. 18 p. 340 ). The Peshwa's Government at Poona often interfered when disputes aroge about properties dedicated to shrines and tombs of saints between the managers of the temples or among the heirs of the saint to whom lands had been originally donated. For example, the Peshwa made an award in 1744 A. D. about the principal religious and charitable institution in the Deccan, viz. the Obinch vad Samsthan, whereby ho set apart one half of all pro perties bestowed on the shrine at that place for purely religious and obaritable purposes and distributed the other half between the manager and his kinsmen who were all descendants of the original founder, Shri Moraya Gosavi ( vide Chintaman v.

This privilege of ancient rulers to redress grievances and correct abuses in the management of religious and charitable endow ments devolved upon the British Government as laid down by the Privy Council in Rajah Muthu Ramlinga v. Perianayagum Pillai, L.R 1 I. A. 209 et p. 232 'It is evident...that the British Government, by virtue of its sovereign power, asserted as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endow ments of this kind and to prevent and redress abuses in their management'. The Indian Central and Provincial Legislatures huve placed on the Statute book many Acts regulating religious and charitable endowments. A list of the most important of these enactments is given below.*111 

Property dedicated to a god is called 'devottara' (the word being written as debutter in the Law Reports, particularly from Bengal). Vide Sham Charan Nandi v. Abhiram Goswami, 33 Cal.511 at p. 523. A good deal of litigation comes up to the courts about the rights and liabilities of the trustees and the sevakas (called Shebart in Bengal), about their mismanagement of the temple properties and their removal and so forth. 

Among impartible things Manu (IX. 219 ) included yoga kşema. The Mit. on Yāj.

as tanks, gardens, and temples could not be partitioned by the Bons and grandsons. In modern times also the same is the rule. Besides properties dedicated to temples and other religious and charitable purposes are generally inalienable, according to legislative enactments and judicial decisions, "118 except where an alienation is absolutely necessary for the upkeep of the religious worship or for the benefit and preservation of the institution. 

A question arises whether, when a work of public utility is dedicated, the founder possesses any control over the thing dedicated and if so to what extent. The Viramitrodaya (on Vyavahāra 2114 ) furnishes an answer to this question. The follow ing is the gist of its argument keeping as close to the original as possible. When a man throws an oblation into fire, his owner ship over the oblation comes to an end; but the oblation belongs to nobody. No human being has accepted it. Yet the sacrificer can prevent any one who wants to desecrate the offering by bringing it into contact with something impure from doing so and can see to it that the offering is reduced to ashes in the fire undisturbed. Similarly when a tank or a garden is dedicated to the publio, the ownership of the founder in the thing is gone, but there is no other individual owner and no new ownership arises in any single person; yet the founder can prevent a third person making himself owner of the thing dedicated to the public and it cannot be argued that the founder cannot interfere for protecting the thing and that there is no blame if he does not safeguard the assumption of ownership by a third person. The practice of respectable people viz. the exercise of the right of preservation in the case of both ( i. e. in the case of what is offered into the fire and what is dedicated to the publio ) is based on this consideration. The sāstric injuno. tion about utsarga does not merely contemplate the divesting

of one's ownership and dedication to the public, but also that the thing dedicated be enjoyed by the publio without inter ference or encroachment, just as in homs also one does not merely desire to throw an oblation into fire (and rest oontent with that) but one desires to see that the oblation is reduced to ashes and is not rendered impure. This shows that the founder of a temple or the builder of a tank or garden would always retain & power to preserve the thing dedicated. 

Questions as to whether a new image can be substituted by the trustee or the shebait of a temple or whether he can remove the image to another place do come before the courts. Vide Kali Kania Chatterji v. Surendra 41 C. L. J. 128 ; Pra. matha Natha v. Pradyumna Kumar 30 O. W. N. 25 (P. O.) where the P. O. laid down (p. 33 ) that family idols are not merely movable chattels and that their destruction, degradation and injury are not within the power of the founder or other custo dian for the time being; vide Hari Raghunath v. Anant Bhikaji 44 Bom. 466, where it was held that the manager of a public temple has no right to remove the image from the old temple and instal it in another new building, especially when the removal is objected to by a majority of the worshippers. 

CHAPTER XXVII 

VĀNAPRASTHA (forest hermit ) 

Vaikbānasa appears to have been the ancient name for Vānaprastba. In the Anukramani one hundred Vaikbānasas are said to have been the seers of Rg. IX. 66 and a Vamra Vaikbānasa is the seer of Rg. X. 99. The Tai. A. I. 23 connects the word Vaikhādase with the nakhas of Prajāpati (yo nakbās te vaikhānasāḥ ), 8115 It appears that in ancient times there was some work called Vaikhānasa sāstra which treated of the rules for forest hermits. Gaut. III. 2 uses the word Vaikhānssa for this asrama. Baud. Dh. S. II, 6.19 defines a vānaprastha 116 as one who follows the practices laid down in Vaikhānasa-śāstra, Vțddha-Gautama (chap. VIII, p. 564 ) appears to suggest that Vaikhānasas and Pancarātrikas were two schools of Vaisnavas, the former calling Vişnu by the appellations of Puruşa, Acyuta and Aniruddha, while the Pañoarātrikas spoke of Vişnu ag having the four mürtis or vyuhas viz. Vasudeva, Sankarşana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha,211? The Par. M. vol. I, part 2, p. 139 after quoting Vas. Dh. S. 9. 11 (śrāmanakenāgaimadhaya ) remarks that Srāmaņaka is Vaikhā naga-sūtra that propounds the duties of tapasvins. Kalidasa in the Sakuntala speaks of the life led by the charming Sakuntala in Kanva's bermitage as vaikhānasa vrata2118 (I. 27). Manu VI. 21 describes the Vānaprastha as abiding by the views ( mata ) of Vaikhānasa and Medhatihi explains that Vaikhānasa is a sāstra in which the duties of the forest hermit are expounded.

bharata?!19 (Śanti 20. 6 and 26. 6) states that the view of the Vaikhānasas is that it is better to have no desire for amassing wealth than to hanker after wealth. Sankarācārya on Vedānta sūtra III. 4. 20 speaks of the third asrama as vaikhānase and as indicated by the word tapas used in Chān. Up. II. 23. 1. 

The word vānaprastha is according to the Mit. the same as vanaprastha, whioh means 'one who stays in a forest in a pre-eminent way. (by observing & strict code of life ). Kşir& svāmi derives it differently.9130 

The time for becoming a forest hermit arises in two ways. According to the Jābālopanişad quoted above (p.421) a man may become a vānaprastha immediately after the period of student hood or after passing some years as an householder. Manu (VI.2) indicates the age by saying when & householder sees his skin wrinkled and his hair growing white and sees the sons of his sons he may betake himself to the forest'. The commentators were divided in their opinions, some holding that all three con ditions ( wrinkles, grey hair and seeing son's sons ) must be fulfilled before one could become a forest hermit, others held that only one of them need be fulfilled and others again said that these conditions are only indicative of the age viz. that a man must be old or over 50. Kullūka on Manu III. 50 quotes a smrti' a man may resort to a forest after 50'. 

Gaut. III. 25-34, Ap. Dh. S. II. 9. 21. 18---II. 9. 23.2, Baud. Dh. S. III. 3, Vas. Dh. S. IX, Manu VI. 1-32, Yāj. III. 45-55, Vişnu Dh. 8. 95, Vaik.

The principal points are stated below with a few references : 

(1) One may go to a forest with one's wife or one may leave her in charge of one's sons (Manu VI. 3, Yaj. III. 45). The wife may accompany if she desires. Medhatithi notes that some explained that if the wife was young he may place her in charge of the sons and that an old wife may accompany her husband.

(2) He takes with bim to tbe forest his tbree Vedio fires and his gphya fire&ial together with such sacrificial utensils as the ladles called sruc, sruva. Ordinarily the wife's co-opera tion is required in offering sacrifices, but when the wife is given in charge of the song, ber co-operation then is supposed to be dispensed with or it may be held that she has consented to all acts by agreeing to stay with the song. On repairing to the forest he should perform the srauta sacrifices of new moon and full moon, the āgrayana işti, the cālurmāsyas, Turāyana and Dak. şāyana ( Manu VI. 4, 9-10, Yaj. III. 45). The sacrificial food was to be prepared from corn like nivāra growing in the forest. It appears that according to some writers the forest hermit was to give up his srauts and gļhya fires and kindle & new fire in accordance with rules laid down in the grāmaņaka 2133 (i. e. the Vaikhānasa sutra) and offer sacrifices therein. Vide Gaut. III. 26, Ap. Dh. 8. II. 9. 21. 20 and Vas. Dh. S. IX. 10.2 123 

2121. If he has followed the ardhadhana mode, then he bas sepa rate srauta and gžbya fires ; but if bo bas followed the sarvadhana' mode, then he has only srauta fires, which alone ho takes with him. When a man consecrates the tree srauta fires be may do so with half of his smārta fire and keep the other balf of the smārta fire. This is ardhadbina. If he does not keep the smarta fire separate it is Bery dbāna. Vido Ap. Śr. V. 4, 12-16, V. 7. 8 and Nirnayesindhu (III purvārdha, p. 370). If he has no frauta fires then he takes only tho grbya fire. One who has no wife living can also becomo a forest hormit. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 45.

Ultimately he is to leave the keeping of fires by depositing the sacred fires in his own self according to the rules prescribed (in Vaikbānasa gūtra ). Vide Manu VI. 25, Yāj. IIT. 45. 

(3) He has to give up all food that he used to partake of when he was in his village and also all household parapber nalia ( cows, horses, beds &c.) and subsist on flowers, fruits, roots and vegetables growing in the forest on land or in water or on corn fit for sages such as nívāra and syāmaka (Manu VI. 5 and 13, Gaut. III. 26 and 28). But he has to avoid partaking of honoy, flesh, mushrooms growing on the ground, and the vegetables called Bhüstřna, Sigruka, the Sleşmātaka fruit, though these are forest produce (Manu VI. 14). Gautama allowed him as a last resort to partake of the flesh of animals killed by carnivorous beasts. Yāj. IIC. 54-55, Manu VI. 27-28 allow him to beg for alms at the dwellings of other hermits or allow bim to go to a village and bring by begging silently eight morsels of food. He can use salt prepared by himself only ( Manu V1. 12). 

(4) He has to perform the five daily sacrifices to gods, sages, Manes, men ( guests) and to bhūtas with food fit for asoetics or with fruits, roots and vegetables and give alms thereout ( Manu VI. 5 and 7, Gaut. III. 29-30, Yāj. III. 46 ). 

(5) He has to bathe thrice in the day, in the morning, at noon and in the evening ( Manu VI, 22 and 24, Yāj. III. 48, Vas. IX, 9); while Manu VI. 6 appears to prescribe a bath twice a day only in the morning and in the evening. So there was an option. 

(6) He was to wear & deer-skin or a tattered garment(i.e. one of bark or kuģa grass or the like ) and allow his hair and nails to grow. Vide Manu VI. 6, Gaut. III. 34, Vas. IX. 11. 

(7) He should be devoted to the study of the Veda and recite it inaudibly (Ap. Dh. S. II 9. 22. 9, Manu VI. 8, Yaj, III. 48). 

(8) He should live a life of complete continence, should be self-restrained, friendly ( to all), collected in mind, over liberal but never a recipient and be compassionate towards all beings (Manu VI. 8, Yāj. III. 45 and 48). In view of Yāj. III. 45, Vas. IX. 5 and Manu VI. 26, Kullüka seems 2134 to be

wrong in holding that if a forest hermit takes his wife with him he may cohabit with her at the prescribed times. 

(9) He is not to use corn growing on ploughed land in the forest even if the owner negleots to garner it nor is he to eat fruits and roots growing in villages (Manu VI. 16 and Yāj. III. 46 ). 

(10) He may cook wild corn or he may eat only what becomes naturally ripe ( like fruits ) or he may pound between stones the grain to be used by him, or may employ his teeth only as mortar and he is not to employ ghee in his cooking or religious rites but only the oil of wild fruits ( Manu VI. 17 and Yāj. III. 49 ). 

(11) He is to eat only once either in the day in the 4th part ( of the day divided into eight ) or at night or he may take food every alterpate day or once after two or three days (Vişnu Dh. S. 95. 5-6, Manu VI. 19). He may also follow the method of the penance of Cāndrāyaṇa ( stated in Manu XI. 216) or he may subsist on wild fruits, roots and flowers only (Manu VI. 20-21, Yaj. III. 50 ) or may eat only once at the end of a fortnight ( according to one's ability ). He may reduce gradually the quantity of food he takes, ultimately subsisting on water alone or on wind ( Ap. Dh, S. II. 9. 23. 2, Manu VI. 31). Vide Vişnu Dh. S. 95. 7-12 also. 

(12) He may aocumulate food materials only for a day or a month or 8 year ( but never for more than a year) and should throw away his stored food material every year in the month of Ašvina (Manu VI. 15, Yāj. III. 47, Ap. Dh. 8. II. 9. 22, 24 ).2135 

(13) He should practise severe austerities by standing in the midst of five fires (4 fires in the four directions and the blazing sun overhead), by standing in the open in the rains, by wearing wet garments in winter (Manu VI. 23-34, Yāj. III. 52, Visņu Dh. S. 95. 2-4) and thus habituate his body to privations and niortifications. 

(14) He should gradually give up residing in a house, but should stay under a tree and subsist only on fruits and roots 9126 (Manu VI. 25, Vas. IX. 11, Yaj. III. 54, Āp. Dh. 8. II. 9. 21.20 ).

(15) At night he should sleep on the bare ground, should pass the day either sitting or moving about or in the practice of Yoga and should make no effort to enjoy the things that give pleasures (Manu VI. 22 and 26, Yaj. III. 51). 

(16) He should study the various texts of the Upanigads for the purity of his body, for the increase of his knowledge and ultimately for realising brahma ( Manu VI. 29-30). 

(17) If the forest hermit suffers from some Inourable disease and cannot properly perform his duties or feels death to be near, he should start on the great journey (Mahāpra sthāna ) turning his face towards the north-east, subsisting on water and air only, till the body falls to rise no more (Manu VI. 31, Yaj. III. 55). The Mit. and Aparārka (p. 945) on Yaj. III. 55 quote & smţti & forest hermit may resort to the distant journey or may enter water or fire or may throw him self from a precipice'. 9197 

The Baud. Dh. S. III. 3 gives an intricate classification of vānaprasthas. They are either pacamānakas ( who take cooked or ripe food) or apacamānakas ( who do not cook thoir food). Each of these two classes is again sub-divided into five. The five pacamānakas are sarvāraṇyakas, vaituşikas, those who subsist on fruits, roots and bulbous roots, those who subsist.on fruits only, those who subsist on vegetables only. Sarvārapyakas are of two kinds, viz. indrāvasiktas ( who bring creepers, shrubs and cook them, offer agnihotra therewith and offer it to guests and eat the rest ) and reto-vasiktas (who bring the flesh of animals killed by tigers, wolves or hawks and cook it and offer to Agni &o.). The apacamānakas are five viz. unmajjakas ( who do not employ implements of iron or stone for holding food ), pravrttāśinah (who eat food from their hands, without using any vessel ), mukhenādāyinaḥ ( who eat food with their mouth, without using their hands, as boasts do ), toyāhāras (who subsist on water only ), vāyubhaksāḥ ( who observe total fast). These are socording to Baud, the ten dikşās of Vaikhānasas. Manu also (VI. 29 ) calls the rules to be observed by forest hermits diksās. 

Bphat-Parāsera ( ohap. XI. p. 290 ) speaks of four divisions of vanaprasthas viz. Vaikhānasa, Udumbara, Valakhilya and

Vanevāsi; while Vaikh. VIII. y says that the vānaprasthas are either sapatnika ( who stay with their wife ) or apatnika and the first are of four varieties viz. Audumbara, Vairiños, Valakhilya and Phenapa. The Rāmāyana ( Aranya, chap. 10. 2-6 ) speaks of forest hermits under various designations such as the Valakbilyas, Aşmakuţtas &o. 

Any person of the three higher varņas could become a vānaprastha, but a südre could not do so. Manu VI. 1 when starting the topic of vānaprasthas employs the word 'dvija'. In the Santiparva 21. 15 it is stated that a kşatriya after trans ferring the kingdom to his son should subsist in a forest on wild food and follow the srāvaņsoriptures. *118 In the Asya medhika-perva 35. 43 it is expressly stated that the order of vānaprasthas is meant for the three dvijātis.*** The Mahābhārata cites many examples of royal personages becoming vānaprag. thes. Yayati after crowning his youngest and most dutiful son Pūru as a king is said to have become a forest hermit (Ādiparva 86.1) where he practised various austerities ( Adi. 86. 12-17) and ultimately ended his life by fasting ( Adi. 75. 58). In the Aśramavāsi-parva ( chap. 19 ) the blind king Daftarāştra is said to have become a forest hermit with his wife Gāndhari who put on bark garments and deer-skin. The Par, M.( I. part %, p. 139 ) relying on Manu VI.%, Yama and other sages states its view that men of the three varnas could become forest hermits. Women also could repair to the forest. The Mausala parva (7. 74) states that when Krsna left the mortal body, Satyabhāmā and other queens of Krsna entered the forest having resolved to undergo severe austerities. The Adiparva ( 128. 12-13) narrates that, on the death of Paņdu, Satyavati with her two daughters-in-law repaired to a forest for austerities and died there. Vide also Santi 147. 10 (for Mabāprasthāns ) and Asramavāsiparva. 37. 27-28. According to Vaik.

through two (brahmacarya and gārbastbya) and a südra could resort to only one viz. the householder's mode of life. Vide the story of Sambūka referred to above (p. 119 ). 

The question whether ending one's life by starting on the Great Journey or by falling from a precipice is sinful exercised the minds of many writers on dharmaśāstra, The Dharmaśāstra writers generally condemn suicide or an attempt to commit suicide as a great sin. Parāśara (IV. 1-2 ) states that if a man or woman hangs himself or herself through extreme pride or extreme rage or through affliction or fear he or she falls into hell for sixty thousand years.3130 Manu V. 89 says that no water is to be offered for the benefit of the souls of those who kill them selves. The Adiparva ( 179.20 ) declares that one who commits suicide does not reach blissful worlds. Vas. Dh. S. (23. 14-16) ordains "whoever kills himself becomes abhiếasta (guilty of mortal sin) and his sapindas have to perform no death rites for him; a man becomes & killer of the self when be destroys bimself by wood (i. e. by fire), water, clods and stones (i. e, by striking his head against a stone ), weapon, poison, or ropes ( i. e. by hanging ). They also quote & verse 'that dvija who through affection performs the last rites of & man who commits suicide must undergo the penance of Candrāyaṇa with Tapta-kscobra". Vas. Dh, S. 23. 18 prescribes a prayascitta for merely resolving to kill oneself (even when no attempt is made ), Yama ( 20-21 ) prescribes that when a person tries to do away with himself by such methods as hanging, if he dies, his body should be smeared with impure things and if he lives he should be fined two hundred paņas; his friends and sons should each be fined one pana and then they should undergo the penance laid down in the sāstra 2131 

In spite of this general attitude, exceptions were made in the emptis, the epics and purāṇas. When a man was guilty of brahmana murder, he was allowed to meet death at the bands of archers in a battle who knew that the sinner wanted to be killed in that way as a pedance or the sinner may throw himself bead

downwards in fire (Manu XI. 73, Yaj. III. 248 ). Similarly the drinker of spirituous liquor expiated his sin by taking boiling wine, water, ghee, cow's milk or urine and dying thereby ( Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III. 253, Gaut. 23. 1, Vas. Dh. 8. 20.22 ). Vide also Vas. Dh. S. 13. 14, Gaut, 23. 1, Ap. Db.$. I. 9. 25. 1-3 and 6 for similar deadly penances for incest and for drinking liquor and for theft. The Ap.Db.8. (I.10.28. 15-17) quotes Harita who condemns such penances involving death.3132 At extremely holy places like Prayāga, the Sarasvati and Benares persons were allowed to kill themselves by drowning with the desire of securing release from sarnsāra. The Salyaparva ( 39, 33-34 ) states' whoever abandons his body at Pșthūdaka on the northern bank of the Sarasvati after repeating Vedic prayers would not be troubled by death thereafter 1183 The Anusāsanaparva (25. 62-64 ) says that if & man knowing the Vedānta and under standing the ephemeral nature of life abandons life in the holy Himālayag by fasting, he would reach the world of brahma. Vide also Vansparva 85. 83 ( about suicides at Prayāga). The Matsya-purāņa (186. 34-35) eulogises the peak of Amarakantaka by stating' whoever dies at Amarakantaka by fire, poison, water or by fasting enjoys the pleasures ( described in verses 28-33). He who throws himself down (from the peaks of Amarakantaka) never returns (to samsāra )."134 

There are historical examples of this practice supplied by Epigraphy. The Khairha plates of Yaśaḥkarpadeva (dated Kalacuri sainvat 823 i. e. 1073 A. D.) narrate that king Gāngeya obtained release along with his one hundred wives at the famous banyan tree of Prayāga ( E. I. vol. XII. p. 205 at p. 211 ).3185 King Dhangadeve of the Chandella dynasty is said to have lived for more than 100 years and to have abandoned his body at Prayaga while contemplating on Rudra ( E. I. vol. I. p. 140 ). The Calukya king Somesvars after performing yoga

rites drowned himself in the Tungabhadra in 1068 A. D. (E. O. vol. II. Sk. 136). The Raghuvamsa VIII. 94 poetically describes how Aja in his old age when his health was shattered by disease resorted to fasting and drowned himself at the confluence of the holy rivers, the Ganges and the Sarayū, and immediately attained the position of a denizen of Heaven. 

Apart from suicide for purposes of penance or at holy places the smrtis allowed, as said above, & forest hermit to start on the great journey to meet death and also allowed in certain circum stances death by entering fire, or by drowning or by fasting or by throwing oneself from & precipice even for those who were not hermits. Gautama (14. 11) prescribes that no mour ning need be observed for those who wilfully meet death by fasting, or by outting themselves off with & Weapon, or by fire, or poison or water or by hanging or by falling from a precipice. But Atri (218-219) states some exceptions viz. 'if one who is very old (beyond 70), one who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification (owing to extreme weakness &c.), one who is so ill that no medical help can be given, kills himself by throwing himself from a precipice or into fire or water or by fasting, mourning should be observed for bim for three days and srāddba may be performed for him. 2136 Aparārka (p. 536 ) quotes texts of Brabmagarbha, Vivasvat and Gārgya about an householder 'he who suffering from serious illness cannot live, or who is very old, who has no desire left for the pleasures of any of the senses and who has carried out his tasks may bring about bis death at his pleasure by resorting to mabāprasthāna, by entering fire or water or by falling from a precipice. By so doing he incurs no sin and bis death is far better than tapas, and one should not desire to live vainly (without being able to perform the duties laid down by the sāstra). "158 Aparārka (p. 877) and Par, M. (I. part %, p. 228 ) quote several verses from Adipurāna about dying by fasting, by entering fire or deep water or by falling from a precipice, or by going on maba

prasthāna in the Himalāyas or by abandoning life from the branch of the vata tree at Prayaga, the verses declaring that not only does such a man not incur sin but he attains the worlds of bliss. In the Ramayana (Aranya, chap. 9) Sara bhanga is said to have entered fire. We find that the Mșccha katika (1. 4) speaks of king Sūdraka as having entered fire. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 42, the great Emperor Kumāra. gupta is said to have entered the fire of dried cowdung cakes. The editor remarks that there is necessarily no reference to the fact that the emperor voluntarily embraced death by fire. But it appears that there is no great propriety in the description if all that is meant is that the Emperor's corpse was burnt with 'karişa'. 

Some put forward a Vedio passage 'one who desires heaven should not seek to ) die before the appointed span of life is at an end (of itself)' as opposed to the permission for suicide given by the smrtis. Medhātithi on Manu VI. 32 3138 quotes this Vedio text and explains it away by saying that if fruti intended to lay down an absolute prohibition against suioide in every 0880, it would have simply said 'one who desires heaven should not ( seek to) die'. The Vaj. 8. ( 40. 3) contains & verse saying 'whoever destroy their self reach after death Asura worlds that are shrouded in blinding darkness', which really refers to persons ignorant of the correct knowledge of the Self. But this has been interpreted by many as referring to those guilty of suioide (atmahan). Vide Uttararām&carita IV, after verae 3 1188 and Br. Up. IV, 4.11 for & verse similar to that in the Vāj. S. The Rajstarangipi (VI. 1411 ) refers to officers appointed by the king to superintend prāyopavesa (resolving on death by fasting ). 

Among Jains & similar rule prevailed. The Ratnakaranda grāvakācāra (chap. 5) of Samantabhadra (about 2nd century A. D.) dilates on Sallekhana, which consists in abandoning the body for the aco'imulation of merit in calamities, famines,

From the account of the death of Kalanos the Indian gymnosophist at 73 given by Megasthenes (Mo Crindle p. 106) we oan gather that the practice of religious suicide prevailed long before the 4th century B. C. Strabo ( XV. 1. 4 ) states that with the ambassadors that came to Augustus Cæsar from India also arrived an Indian gymnosophist who committed himself to the flames like Kalanos who exhibited the same spectacle before Alexander. 

In the times of the purāņas the method of starting on maba prasthāna and suicide by entering fire or falling from a preci. pice came to be forbidden and was included in Kalivarjya. 2141 

It will be noticed that some of the duties and regulations prescribed for vanaprasthas are practically the same as those for sannyāsins. For example, the rules laid down in Manu VI. 25-29 for forest hermits are almost the same as those for parivrājakas?" (Manu VI. 38, 43, 44). The Ap. Dh. S. employs the same words twice in delineating the characteristics of both (II. 9. 21. 10 and 20). The order of hermits gradually leads on to or rather passes over into that of sannyāsins. Both have to observe celibacy and restraint of senses, both have to regulate the intake and quality of food, both have to contemplate on the passages of the Upanipads and strive for the knowledge of Brahman. There were no doubt some differences. The vāna prastha oould be accompanied by his wife at least in the begin ning, & sannyāsin could not be so. A vānaprastha had to keep fires, perform the daily and other yajñas at least in the begin. ning, the sannyāsin gave up his fires. The Tānaprastha had to concentrate upon tapas, upon inuring himself to privations, severe susterities, and self-mortification, while the sannyasin

was concerned principally with samyama (restraint or quies oence of senses ) and contemplation of the highest Reality, 48 stated by Samkarācārya on Vedāntasütra III. 4. 20.348 Owing to the great similarity and virtual fusion of the two aśramas the stage of vāpaprastha came to be gradually ignored and people passed from the householder's life directly to the life of sannyaga. Govindasvāml on Baud. Dh. S. III. 3. 14-17 remarks that the doārys (Baudhayana) should be asked why he describes the two orders of vānaprastha and sannyāsa as distinct. 2144 In course of time no one probably became a vānaprastha and therefore having recourse to the stage of vānaprastha came to be forbidden in the Kali age. 3145

Sannyāsa.( the order of ascetics ). That the Chān. Up. was well aware of the three asramas of student-hood, house holder and forest hermit has been shown above (p. 420 ). It is somewhat doubtful whether the Chan. Up. regarded sannyaga as the fourth and the last stage in a man's life when ideally planned. It merely states that one that holds fast by the realization of brahman attains immortality'. But it appears that a stage of the abandonment of worldly riches, & life of begging and contemplation of the Absolute and its reali zation had been known to the earliest Upanisads like the Bphadāraṇyaka. Whether it was the fourth stage or whether it could be reached even in the stage of brabmacarya or of a house-holder is left in doubt so far as the older Upanişads are concerned. The Jabalopanişad (4) has been quoted above (p. 421 ) to show that it gave an option either to regard sannyaga as the 4th stage in a man's life or to resort to it immediately after any of the first two āśramas. 

In the Bṛ, Up. (II. 4.1) we see that Yajñavalkya 2146 when about to become a parivrājaka (a wandering ascetic) tells his wife Maitreyi that he was going to leave home and that he wanted to divide whatever wealth he had between her and her co-wife Katyayani. This shows that & parivrājaka had even then to leave home and wife and to give up all belongings. The same Upanişad in another place (III.5.1) states those who realize Atman give up the hankering after progeny, possessions and heavenly worlds and practise the beggar's mode of life ; therefore the brāhmaṇa, having completely mastered (and so risen beyond) mere learning, should seek to be like a child (i. e. should not make a parade of his latent capacities or know. ledge ) and having completed ( gone beyond ) knowledge and

balya ( child-like behaviour ) he should attain to the position of & muni, and having risen beyond the stage of a muni or non muni, should become a real brāhmaṇa (one who has realized brahman). Vide also Bļ. Up. IV. 4. 22 for similar words and sentiments. The Jābālopanişad (5)2147 declares that the ascetic (parivrāt) wears discoloured (not white ) garments, has & tonsured head, has no possessions, is pure, hates (or injures ) no one, begs for alms and thereby tends to attain non-difference from brahmah In the Paramahamsa, the Brahma, the Nārada parivrājaka, and the Sannyasa Upanigads numerous rules are laid down about sannyāsa. But the antiquity and the authenticity of these Upanişads is extremely doubtful and therefore passing them over attention will be confined to the dharmasutras and other ancient smrtis.

(1) In order to qualify himself for sannyāsa, a person had to perform a sacrifice to Prajapati in which whatever he had he distributed to priests and the poor and the helpless (Manu VI, 38, Yāj. III. 56, Vişnu Dh. S. 96. 1, Sankba VII. 1)."\#48 The Yatidharmasangraha ( p. 13 ) prescribes that the Prājāpatyești should be performed by him who had kept the three vedic fires and the işți to Agni should be performed by others who kept only the gṛhya fire. The Jābalopanişad 4 adds that the sacrifice should be for Agni (and not for Prajapati as some hold). The

Nřsimhapuripa ( 60. 2-4) requires that before entering upon this order one should perform eight sraddbas. The Nřsimba puriņa 58. 36 allows every one who is & vedio student to become an ascetic if his tongue, his sexual emotions, his appe tite for food and his speech are pure ( i. e, under striot control ). The eight srāddhas are daiva (to Vasus, Rudras, Adityas), arsa ( to the ten sages viz. Marici and others), divya (to Hiraṇya. garbha and Vairaja), mānuşya (to Sanaka, Sanandana and five others), bhautika (to five bhūtas, prthvi &c.) paitska (to Kavyavād fire, Soma, Aryaman, pitss called Agnişvātts &c.), mātřsraddha (to ten mātrs such as Gauri, Padma), atmasrāddha (to Paramātman). Vide Yati-dh. p. 9 and Sm, M. p. 177. Manu is careful to point out (VI. 35-37) that a man should fix his mind on mokşa after studying the Veda, procreatiog sons, performing sacrifices i. e. after discharging his debts to the sages, the pitrs and gods. Baud. Dh. 8. II. 10. 3-6 and Vaik. IX. 6 state that an householder who has no children or whose wife is dead or who has established his children in the path of dharma or who is over 70 may become an ascetic. Kautilya (II. 1 ) prescribes that if a person embraces the order of ascetics without making proper provision for his wife and Bons he shall be punished with the first ammercement. 249 He has to deposit his fires in himself and leave home (Manu VI. 38). 

(2) After leaving home, wife, children and possessions, he should dwell outside the villages, should be homeless and stay under a tree or in an un-inhabited bouse wherever he may be when the sun sets and should always wander from place to place; but he may remain in one place only in the rainy sea Bon 3150 (Manu VI. 41, 43-44, Vas. Dh, 8. X. 12-15, Sankba VII. 6). Sankha (quoted by the Mit. on Yāj, III. 58 ) allows him to stay in one place only for two months in the rains, while Kanya says that he may stay one night in a village and five in a town (except in the rains). When he follows the rule of staying four or two months in one place, he should do so from the full moon of Aşādha or an ascetio may always stay on the banks of the Ganges.

(3) He should always wander alone without a com panior, as by so doing he will be free from attachments and the pangs of separation. Daksa (VII, 34-38) emphasizes this is point very well the real ascetio always stays alone; if two stay together, they form a pair; if three stay together they are like a village and if more (than three stay together ) then it becomes like a town. An ascetio should not form a pair or & village or a town; by so doing ho swerves from his dharma, sinos (if two or more stay together, they begin to exchange news about the ruling prince, about the alms obtained and by olose contact sentiments of affection, jealousy or wickedness arise between them. Bad ascetios engage in many activities viz. expounding (texts) for seouring money or honour and also gathering pupils round them. There are only four proper actions for an ascetic and no fifth viz. contemplation, purity, begging, always staying alone'. Nārada says 'there are six acts which ascetios must do as if ordered by the king under the threat of a penalty viz. begging, japa, contemplation, bath (thrice daily), purity and worship of Siva or Vişnu ( quoted in Yati-dh. p. 62 and Sm. M. p. 188). "1512 

(4) He should be celibate, should always be devoted to contemplation and spiritual knowledge and should be un attached to all objects of sense and pleasure (Manu VI. 41 and 49, Gaut. III. 11). 

(5) He should move about avoiding all trouble or injury to creatures, should make all creatures safe with him, should bear with indifference all disrespect, should entertain no anger towards him who is furious with him, should utter benedictions over him also who runs him down, should never utter an untruth (Menu VI. 40, 47-48, Yāj. III. 61, Gaut. III. 23). 

(6) He should neither kindle srauta fires nor gphy& fire nor even ordinary fire for cooking food and should subsist on

food obtained by begging (Manu VI. 38 and 43, Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 21. 10, Adiparva 91. 12). 

(7) He may enter a village for begging food only once a day, he should not ordinarily stay in a village at night (except in the rains) but if he stays at all he should do so only for one night (Gaut. III. 13 and 20, Manu VI. 43,55 ). 

(8) He should beg alms from seven houses without seleoting them beforehand (Vas. Dh. S. X. 7, Sankba VII. 3, Adi. 119. 12 'five or ten houses'). Baud. Db. S. ( II, 10. 57-58 ) presoribes that he should visit for alms the houses of brābmaņa householders of the Sālina and Yayāyara types and should only wait for as much time as would be required for milking a cow. Baud. Dh. 8. II, 10. 69 quotes the view of others that an ascetic may take alms from persons of all varpas or food from only one among dvijātis; Vas. X. 24 also says that he should beg of brāhmaṇas only. The Vāyupurāņa I. 13. 17 prescribes that Ascetics should not eat food belonging to one man (but should eat food collected from several houses ), or flesh or honey should not accept āmasraddha (i. e. sraddha with uncooked food ), should not use salt directly or by itself ( i. e. they may eat vegetables in cooking which salt has been used ). According to Usanas ( quoted in Sm. M. p. 200 and Yati-dh. pp. 74-75 ) food obtained by begging is of five kinda viz. madhukara (collecting food from any three, ive or seven houses at random just as bees collect honey from any flowers ), prākpranita (when a request is made by devotees to take food at their houses even before the ascetic gets up from his bed), ayācita (when invitation to take food at his house is given by a man before the ascetic starts on his begging round ), tātkālika ( the food that is announced by a brahmana the moment the ascetic approaches ), upapanna ( cooked food brought to the matha by devoted disciples or other people ). Vas. Dh. S. X. 31 says that & brābmaņa ascetio should avoid food at sūdra houses and A parārka p. 963 explains this as implying that in the absence of brahmana houses an ascetio may beg for food from ksatriyas and raibyas. In later times begging alms from persons of all castes was forbidden, being included among kalivarjya actions (yates tu sarva-varnosu na bhikṣāosranam kalau '). Vide Sm. M. p. 201. It was stated by Parāsara and Kratu that no fault attaches to an ascetio if he being very old or very ill took food from a single person on a certain day or for several days or begged for food at the house of his sons, 

Oh. XXVIII) 

Sannyası 

935 

friends, teacher or brothers or wife (vide Sm. M. p. 201, Yati dh. p. 75). Acoording to Paragara I. 51 and the Sūtasaṁbitā (Jñana-yoga-khanda 4. 15-16 ) the first claim on the food cooked in the house is that of an asoetic and a brabmacārin and one has to perform the Cāndrayana penance for taking one's meals without giving alma to them. In giving food to an asoetio first water is poured on his hand, then food is given and then again water is poured on his hand (Parāśara I. 53 quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. V. 16). Vide Ap. Db. S. II. 2. 4. 10 and Yaj. I. 107. 

(9) He should go out for begging when the smoke from kitchens has ceased to rise and when the noise of pestles has died down and the live coals (in the kitchen) have been extinguished and the plates used for the dining (by the house holders) have been kept aside i. e. he should beg food in the evening (Manu VI.56, Yāj. III. 59, Vas. X. 8, Sankha VII.2). He should not take as alms honey or flesh (Vas. X. 24). He should not endeavour to secure alms by the practice of predicting, interpreting portents and omens or by the practice of descri bing the consequences indicated by them, nor by astrology nor by expounding the principles of a loro nor by casuistry (or discussion) nor should be approach a house that is already besieged by hermits, brāhmaṇas, birds and dogs, beggars or others ( Manu VI. 50-51 ). 

(10) He should not eat food to satiety, but should eat only as much as is necessary to keep body and soul together and should not feel delight when he gets substantial alms nor feel dejected when he gets little or nothing (Manu VI. 57 and 59, Vas. X. 21,22 and 25, Yāj. III. 59). There is a famous verse' an asostic should take only eight morsels of food, a forest hermit 16, a householder 32 and a vedio student an unli. mited number (Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13, Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 68 ). 

(11) He should hoard nothing and he should own or possess nothing except his tattered garments, his water jar, begging bowl (Manu VI. 43-44, Gaut. III. 10, Vas. X. 6). Devala quoted by the Mit. on Yuj. III. 58 deolares that the Ascetic should possess only & water-jar, a pavitra ( oloth for straining water ), pādukas, an dgana and & kantha ( wallet for proteotion from extreme cold). The Mahābhārata states that wearing oohre-coloured garments, shaving the head, and keeping & water jar and three staffs--these are only outward signs meant 

936

(Ch. XXVIII 

to secure food and do not lead to moksa \#1316 ( dialogue of Janaka and Sulabha). The Mahabhagya (vol. I. p. 365 ) also deolares that a man is known to be a parivrājaka on seeing his three staffs. The Vayupurāņa I. 8 ( quoted by Apararka pp. 949-950 ) lays down what he should possess. He should take & staff of bamboo the outward surface of which is intaot, which is not formidable and which has the parvans (the parts between the joints ) of equal length, which is surrounded by a rope of oow's tail hair four angulas in length and has three knots and which he holds in his right hand; he should have a sikya (loop on which to carry his jar or other things ) made of kusa or cotton or hemp threads or strings and of the form of a lotus and six mustis ( fists ) in length; he should also have & water jar and a pātra ( Teasel or bowl for begging ); he may bave a seat ( asana ) of wood square or round in size for sitting on or for washing his feet; he should have a loin-cloth to cover his private parts and a kantha (patched garment or wallet ) for protection against cold and he may have two padukās (sandals). He should have only these and should not accumulate any. thing else. 

(12) He should wear garments only for covering his pri vate parts and may wear such garments as were worn by others and are used by him after washing (Gaut. IIL 17-18), wbile Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 9. 21. 11-12 ) states that he should wear clothes thrown away by others and that some say that he may be naked. Vas. (X. 9-11 ) says that be should cover his body with a piece of cloth ( sat1 ) or with deer skin or with grass cut down for cows. Baud. Dh. S. II. 6. 24 requires that his garments should be ocbre-coloured ( quoted by Aparārka p. 962 ). 

(13) The begging bowl and the plate from which the dscetic eats should be made of olay or wood or of a gourd, or of bamboo which should be without holes and he should not use metal vessels; and these Vessels are to be cleaned, with water and scoured with cow's hair (Manu VI. 53–54, Yaj. III. 60 and Laghu-Vişnu IV. 29-30). 

(14) He should pare his pails, out all his hair and beard (Manu VI. 52, Vas. Dh. S. X. 6); but Gaut. III. 21 appears to

allow him an option viz. he may tonsure the wbole head or keep only a top-knot. 

(15) He should sleep on raised ground (sthandila ), should feel no concern if he suffers from an illness, he should neither welcome death nor should be feel joy for continuing to live, but he should patiently wait till the time of death, as & servant waits till the time he is hired expires (Manu VI, 43 and 46). 

(16) He should generally observe silence except when be repeate the Vedio texts learnt by him (Manu VI. 43, Gaut. III. 16, Baud. Dh. 9. II. 10. 79, Ap. Db. S. II. 9. 21. 10 ).*15 

(17) He should be tridandi (carrying three staffs ) according to Yaj. III. 58, while Manu VI. 5% simply says he should be dandi ( i. e. oarrying a staff). The word danda is used in two senses, a staff of bamboo or restraint. Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 53 gives an option that he may be ekadandi or a tridandi and also says that he should not cause harm to creatures by speech, actions and mind (II. 6. 25). Manu XII. 10, which is the same as Dakşa (VII. 30), declares that that man is called tridandi who has restraint over his speech, mind and body. Daksa makes certain apt remarks 'Even gods who pre-eminently possess the sattvaguna are carried away by pleasures of senge ; what of men? Therefore he who has given up his taste for pleasures should resort to danda; others cannot do it as they will be carried away by pleasures. An ascetio is not called tridandi by carrying bamboo staffs ; he is trilundi who has the spiritual danda in him. Many people make their livelihood under the guise of (carrying) three dapdas' (VII. 27-31, quoted by Aparārka p. 953). Restraint of speech requires that he should observe silence, restraint of sotion that be should cause injury to no oreature and restraint of mind that he should engage in prāņāyām& and other yogio practices. Dakşa bim self says (I, 12-13) that the three staffs are the special out. ward sign of a yati as the girdle, deer-skin and staff are the out ward signs of the vedio student or long nails and beard are indicia of the forest hermit. Laghu.Vişnu IV.1% says he may be ekadandi or tridandi. The Jivanamuktiviveka (p. 154)

(Ch. XXVIII 

quotes verses to the effect he who wields the staff of the know ledge of Reality is called ekadandi, while he who merely holds & stick in his hand without knowledge and eats everything (or has all sorts of desires ) reaches terrible hells'. 

(18) He should recite the vedic texts referring to yajñas or gods or texts of a metaphysioal character found in the Vedanta (suoh as 'satyam jāānam-anantam brahma' in Tai. Up. %. 1). Vide Manu VI. 83. 

(19) He should walk after ascertaining with his eye that the ground he treads is pure, should drink water after passing it through a piece of cloth (in order to prevent ants &o. being taken in by him ), he should utter words purified by truth and should do what his conscience ( inner voice ) decides to be right or proper (Manu VI. 46, Sankha VII. 7, Vişņu Dh. 8. 96. 14-17). 

(20) In order to generate the feeling of vairāgya ( desire. lessness ) and to curb his senges he should make his mind dwell upon the body as liable to disease and old age and as packed full of impurities; and should revolve in his mind the transitory nature of all mundane things, the trouble one has to undergo in body and mind from conception to death, the incessant round of births and deaths (Manu VI. 76-77, Yaj. III. 63-64, Vişnu Dh. S. 96. 25-42). 

(21) Truthfulness, not depriving another of his posses sions or his duo, absence of wrath (even against one who harms ), humility, purity ( of body and food &c. ), discrimina tion, steadiness of mind ( in sorrow ), quiescence (or restraint) of mind, restraint of senses, knowledge of the self), these are the dharma of all varpas (or these constitute the essence of dharma). And these have to be acquired most of all by the ascetio, since the outward signs, viz. the scanty olothing, the water jar &c. are not the real means of discharging the real dutios of sannyāsa, us anyone oan possess these outward signs. Vide Manu VI. 66, 92-94, Yaj. III. 65-66, Vas. X, 30, Baud. Dh. S. II. 10 55-56, Santi, 111. 13-14, Vāyupurāņa vol. I. 8. 176-178 ( ten characteristios, five called vratas and five upavratas ). 

(22) He should endeavour lo purify his mind by prāpi yama and other practices of yoga and thereby enable himself gradually to realize the Absolute and secure final release (Manu VI. 70-75, 81, YAJ. III. 62, 64). 

In many works ascetics are divided into four classes, The Mahabharata ( Anugasana 141, 89) says that ascetios are 

Ch. XXVIII 

Sannyasins-kinds of 

939 

of four sorts, kuţioaka, bahüdaka, hamsa and paramahamsa, each later one being superior to each preceding one. 31$2a Vaik. VIII. 9, Laghu-Vişnu IV. 14-23, Sūtasambitā (Mānayoga khanda chap. 6), Bhikşukopanişad, Prajāpati (quoted by Aparārka p. 952) define these four. They do not all agree. The kuticaka, as the name itself implies, is one who resorts to sannyāga in his own house or in a but erected by his sons, begs food of his sons and relatives, wears the top-knot, the sacred thread, has the three staffs, carries a water-jar and stays in the same hut. The description of these four contained in Vaik.,8153 being probably among the oldest available, is set out here. The kuțioakas stay in the hermitages of sages like Gautama, Bharadyāja, Yājñavalkya and Harita, take eight morsels of food every day, know the essence of the path of Yoga and hanker only after moksa (release). The bahůdakas have three staffs, the water-jar and wear garments dyed with ochre, beg for food at seven houses of sage-like brāhmaṇas or other well-conducted men but avoid taking flesh, salt and stale food. The baṁsas stay not more than one night in a village and not more than five nights in a town for alms or subsist on cow's urine or dung, or fast for a month or always perform the cāndrayana penance. Pitamaba quoted in Sm, M. ( varnāśrama p. 184) states that the hassas carry only one danda, enter a village only for alms and otherwise stay under & tree or in a cave or on a river bank. 

The Paramahamsas always stay under a tree or in an unia habited house or in a burial place and either wear a garment or are naked; they are beyond the pairs of dharms and adharms, truth and falsehood, purity and impurity. Thoy treat all alike, they regard all as the Self, to them a clod of earth or gold is the same and they beg slms from persons of all varņ39. The des. cription in the Bhikşukopanişad is almost in the same words

and also contains the words of the Jābālopanişad as to Parama hamsas. It appears that long before the Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 9. 21. 13-17) i. e, at least five or six centuries before Obrist there were people who thought that an ascetic was beyond all vidhi ( injunctions to do a thing) and nişedba ( prohibition), that he was above the ordinary rules about truthfulness or falsehood, that he should not care for pleasure or pain or for the study of the Vedas, or for this world or the next, he should simply seek to realize the Self, that when he realizes the Self all his sins, if any, would be liquidated thereby. Ap. combats these ideas by saying that such sentiments were opposed to the fastras laying down rules about ascetics, that by realizing the Self, he cannot be free from the effects of what he does or the consequences of having a body. The sentiments which Āp. controverts arose from such passages as the one ls4 in the Bř. Up. IV. 4. 23 This is the eternal greatness of the man who realizes brahma that by the actions he does, he does not add to it or detract from it. Therefore one should only know the real nature of that great ness; he on knowing brahma is not affected by an evil action.' In the Kauşitaki Bộ. Up. III. 1 it is stated $156 'whoever realizes One ( the Supreme Spirit), his worlds (i. e. his position) are not destroyed by any action of his, not even if he kills his parents, not even by theft nor by the murder of a learned brāhmapa.' These words are not to be taken literally, they are merely a boastful utterance (& praudbivāda ), they are really laudatory statements emphasizing the supreme value of the realization of brahman. Similarly the Chan. Up. IV. 14. 3 Bays just as water does not stick to & lotus-leaf, so sinful actions do not cling to him who knows this'. In the same Upanişad (V.2.1) we read 'to him who knows this, nothing becomes unfit as food.' The Upanigads, however, generally lay great stress on moral virtues and emphasize that a high moral life is absolutely necessary for the seeker after spiritual truth. Vide Bę. Up. IV. 4. 23, Chān.

I. 2. 23, I. 3. 8-9 and 1%. The position of the Vedantagūtra (in III. 4.27-31 ) is that the seeker after eternal truth must be endowed with restraint of senses and quiescence of mind and he cannot act just as he pleases (Sabdaścātoskāmakare ) and spurn all rules of morality. Saṁkarācārya on Vedānta-gútra II. 3. 48 and other places makes this position perfectly olear. Visva rūpa on Yāj. III. 66 states that even ascetios of the parama hamsa type are not allowed ( by Yāj. and other gages ) to behave as they please. The Par. M. (I. part 2, pp. 172-176) says that the paramabamsa should have only one dapda and argues that paramahamsas are of two kinds viz. vidvat (those who have already realized brahman) and vividi şu ( those who are eager seekers after realization ) and relies on Bỉ. Up. III. 5.1 for the former and Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 and Jabalopanişad for the latter, Yājõavalkya is an example of vidvat-sannyāsa, whioh leads to jivanmukti (i.e. release even when the body still persists ), while the latter ( vividiş-sannyāsa ) leads to release after the body is no more (i. e. videha-mukti). Vide Jivan-muktivi. veka p. 4 ff. 

The Jābālopanişad 8156 (6) describes the state of parama hamsas at great length. Tbey are sages like Samvartaka, Aru pi, Svetaketu, Durvāsas, Rohu, Nid&gha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya, Raivataka; they do not exbibit any visible signs of their order or any visible rules of conduct; though they are really not mad they behave like one mad; they go out for alms only for keeping body and soul together; they are unaffected by aoquisition or absence (of alms), they have no house but wander about and stay in a temple or on a heap of grass, on an ant-hill, or at the foot of a tree or on a river bank or in a cave, they have attachment for nothing, they are centred in contemplation of the One Spirit.

(II. 6. 3-10) it is only hamsa and paranaharsa that give up gik ba and the sacred thread. 

The Sapnyāsopanişad (13) adds two more varieties to the four enumerated above viz.turlyātita' and 'avadhūta' and defines them as follows: 'turlyātita' (one who is beyond the 4th stage viz. of paramahamsa ) eats only fruits in the way cows take food ( i. e. he does not hold them in his hands ), if he takes cooked food then only from three houses, he wears no cloth, his body only continues to live ( but he is not conscious of that fact), he deals with his body as if it were dead. The svadbūta is beyond all restrictions, he takes food from all varnas except those who are charged with mortal sins or are palita (outcasts ) and eats like an ajagara (a boa constrictor) i. e. lying down and opening only his mouth without any effort and is solely absorbed in the contemplation of the real nature of the Spirit. Medhatithi *17 ( on Manu VI. 32 ) is quite emphatio that sannyāsa does not consist in defying all the rules of sāstra, but in giving up the sentiment of egoism and of possossiveness and that it is not true to say that for the sanny.. sin all rules (even of morality ) are non-existent. 

One important question on wbioh opinion was sharply divided is whether sanngāsa was allowed to all the three varņas or only to brāhmaṇas. Those who held that it was allowed only to brābmaņas argued as follows: In the Br.8168 Up. IV. 4. 22 we find the words 'this Self brāhmaṇas seek to know by the study of the Veda'; similarly Bp. Up. III. 5. 1 states after knowing this Self, brāhmaṇas give up the hankering after progeny, wealth and heavenly worlds and practise begging' and Mundaka I. 2. 12' closely examining the worlds that are the rewards of actions, a brāhmaṇa should come to be disgusted &o.'. Here, the word 'brahmana' being used, sruti indicates that brāhmaṇas alone can be sannyāsins. Manu (VI. 38)

begins bis description of the 4th stage with the words 'a brāhmaṇa should leave bis house and go into the world as a wanderer' and winds up the chapter (VI. 97 ) by saying 'I have declared this fourfold procedure in relation to brābmanas'. Laghu-Vişnu V, 13 emphatically states that the ascetio order is meant only for brābmapas and the other three aśramas are meant for all dvijas. Those who assert that all the regenerate classes can resort to sanngāsa hold that the word 'brāhmaṇa' in the upanişads is used only as illustrative (upalaksana) and not in an exclusive sense and that a Sūtrakāra (Katyāyana ) expressly gays 2159 'the three varnas after studying the Veda can pass through four āśramas'. The Jābālopanişad (4) ordains ' whether a man has fulblled his vratas or not, whether he bas performed samāvartana ( the ceremonial bath after studying Veda ) or not, whether his fires (Vedio ) have ceased or not be should resort to the wandering ascetic's life the very day on which he feels disgust with mundane affairs :. 4180 It thus allows even & brahmacāri to become an ascetic; a kşatriya and vaisya could be a brahmacari. Yāj. III. 32 states that sannyāsa is a means of purification ( of the mind ) in the case of twice-born olasses, Besides the only condition precedent mentioned by the Jāba lopanişad for resorting to pravrajya ( ascetic life ) is vairagya and whoever feels the latter is authorized to betake himself to that stage. Yaj. III. 61 while laying down the observances of asceticos employs the word 'dvijah' and not brāhmaṇaḥ'. The Kūrma-purāņg also says (Uttarārdha 28,2) that a dvija should become an ascetic. 

Both these opposing views are supported by the most famous authors. The first view that only brāhmaṇas can be sannyāsins is affirmed by the great Samkarācārya in his bhāşya on Bf. Up. III. 5, 1 and IV.5. 15, It is most interesting and also very refreshing that Sureśvara 2161 in bis Vārtika on Samkara's

bhāşya on Bf. Up. III. 5. 1 first explains the views of his guru, then enters the lists against his great master and combats his views with cogent arguments. Most of the medieval writers and works such as Medhatithi on Manu ( VI. 97 ), the Mit., the Madanapārijata (pp. 365-373), the Smộtimuktāpbala ( Varņā. grams p. 176 ) uphold the view that only brāhmaṇas can resort to the 4th asrama, while a few works like the Smrtioandrikā ( 1. p. 65 ) support the second view. The position of Visva. rūpx 8168 (on Yaj. III. 61 ) that only brāhmaṇas oan resort to sannyasa causes great perplexity. Sureśvara and Visvarūpa are generally regarded as identioal (vide H. D. vol. I. pp. 261-263 and Journal of the Andhra Historical Society for 1931, vol. V, p. 187). But Sureśvara holds the view that the word brāhmaṇa in the relevant texts is only illustrative. Therefore it follows that either Sureśvara changes his views or that Sureśvara and Visvarūpā are not identical. Ananda giri in bis commentary on Sureśvara's Vārtika (p. 759 ) cites passages from the Mahabharata ( Adi. 119) to establish that kşatriyas could resort to sannyāsa. 2163 śāntiparva ( 63. 16-21) allows sannyāsa to kings when their life is about to end. But the general words of Santi 62.2 appear to be in confliot with this.3164 Kalidasa states that Raghu became a yuti wben he grew old, installed his son on the throne and stayed in a cottage outside the capital and draws a very poetio and striking picture of the contrast between the old king turned ascetic and the prince become king (Raghu-varsa VIII. 14 and 16 ). 

So far as the smrti texts and the medieval works are con cerned a südra could not become a sannyāsin. The Santiparva ( 63.11-14) is quite clear that a sūdra cannot be a bhikṣu. It also ( 18. 32 )*105 informs us that in its day many (probably

including südras) assumed the outward signs of the 4th &grama, got their heads tonsured and moved about in oohre-coloured garments ( kaşaya ) for seouring alms and gifts. But there are olear indications that sūdras did assume even in the times of ancient smrtis the ascetic's garb and mode of life. The Vişnu Dh. 8, V. 115 and Yāj. II. 241 ( as read by Visvarūpa ) presoribe the fine of one hundred panas for one who gave a dinner to sūdra ascetics in rites for gods and the manes. When the Asramam vāsika-parva 26. 33 states that Vidura was buried as an ascetic, the commentator Nilakantha remarks that this indicates that even sūdras can follow the mode of the ascetic life.21684 

It appears that even women could in rare cases adopt the ascetio's life in ancient brahmanio times. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 58 quotes & sutra of Baud. ( striņām caike ) to the effect that according to some icāryas even women could adopt the ascetic mode of life. Patañjali in his Mahābhāşya (vol. II. p. 100) speaks of a woman ascetic ( parivrājikā ) named Sankarā. Yama quoted in the Sm. C. (on vyavahāra p. 254 ) declares 'neither in the Vedas nor in the dharmasastras is prevrajy, enjoined for women; ( procreation and care of) progeny froin & male of the same varna as herself is her proper dharma, this is the establish od rule." 3186 The Sm. C. gives in a far-fetched way absence of sexual intercourse as the meaning of pravrajyā hero. Atri (136 137) lays down that six actions by women and südras lead to sinfulness viz. japa, tapas (austerities ), pravrajyā (ascetic's life ), pilgrimages, endeavour to secure miraculous power by repeating spells, sole devotion to the worship of a goddess.2107 In the drama called Malavikāgnimitra Kalidasa describes the Pandita Kausiki as wearing the garb of an ascetio (in I. 14). It must be said that the general trend of Hinduism is against women adopting the homeless or ascetic life. The Jātakas (e.g. IV. 392) rarely speak of cāndalas as adopting the homeless condition.

History of Dharmadāstra 

(Ch. XXVIII 

When the question is asked whether sūdras or women could resort to gannyasa there is likely to be some confusion. The word 'sannyāsa 'conveys two ideas : abandonment of all actions (kāmya karma) that spring from the desire to secure some object or other and secondly, following a certain mode of life ( asrama) the outward signs of whioh are carrying a staff and the like and the entrance into which is preceded by the utterande of the praişa. The JIvan-muktiviveka?188 (p. 3) states that mokaa (amptatva ) depends upon tyāga ( abandonment) as stated in the Kaivalyopanişad (2) ' not by actions, nor by progeny nor by wealth, but by tyāga some attained mokşa' (release ). For such abandonment even women and sādras are eligible, the best example of a woman giving up everything being tbat of Maitreyi, the wife of Yajāavalkya, who plainly told the sage (Br. Up. IV, 5. 3-4), 'what have I to do with that which will not make me immortal ( will not release me from saṁsāra )?' The Bhagavad-gitā ( 18. 2 ) also declares that sannyāsa means the giving up of actions springing from desires (to secure certain objects). The Jivan-muktiviveka further states that by resorting to the asrama of sandy.se the mother and the wife of & sannyāsin are supposed not to be born again as women (but they may be born as men). So women and sūdras may abandon all notions, though they could not adopt the peculiar ascetio mode of life with its out ward symbols. According to Srikara's bhāşya on Vedāntasūtra I. 3. 34 the order of sannyāga, the peculiar rules of which are recommended by Vedio texts, is only for the three varpas, while mere nyaga (abandonment of worldly pleasures and desires ) can be resorted to by women, sūdras and mixed castes. 9169 

Some espoused the view that sannyāsa was meant only for the blind, the cripple and the impotent, that is, for persons who possessed no eligibility ( adhikāra ) for the performance of

Vedio rites. Samkarācārya in his bhagya on V.S. III. 4. 20 refutes the view that the passage of the Jābālopanişad (4) cited above relates to those who are not eligible for performing Vedio rites and establishes that that passage has in view the general prescription that there is a stage of life called pārivrājya (sannyāsa ) meant for all that seek release from sansāra. Sureśvara in his Vārtika on Samkara's Bs. Up. bhāsya (p. 1908 v. 1144) also refutes the view.1170 Medhatithi on Manu VI. 36 rejects this view (of some ) by saying that the blind or cripple cannot follow the rules and practices (such as not staying in one village for more than one night ) just as they cannot perform Vedio rites and hence it could not have been intended by the smộti writers that sannyās& was only for the blind and the cripple, nor can the impotent take to sannyasa as no upanayana is performed in their case. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 56 follows Medhatithi. The Sm. Mu. (p. 173 ) and Yati-dh. (pp. 5-67 ) quote verses to the effect that the son of an apostate from sannyāsa, one having bad nails or black teeth, one emaciated by phthisis, one devoid of a limb these do not deserve to resort to sannyāba. Similarly those who are guilty of mortal sins or are suspected of them or are vrālyas, those who have left the path of truth, purity, sacrifices, vratas, tapas, charity, study of the Veda and homa should not be allowed to take up the ascetic life. 

One of the principal rules for a yati was that he was to leave wife and home and never to think of sexual matters or to revert to the life of a house-holder. Atri 8171 (VIII. 16 and 18) declaros' I see no penance (expiation) for that twice-born man, who, after having resorted to the duties of & celibate (sandyāsin ), falls off from that stage; he is neither a dvija nor a fādra, his children become cāndālas called Vidūra'. Samkara on V.S. (III. 4. 42 ) explains that these words are only intended to emphasize the great effort required to remain celi. bate as a sannyāsin and that expiations are as a matter of fact prescribed for a bhikṣu having sexual intercourse. Dakşa VII. 33 requires the king to brand on the forehead with the mark of

dog's foot and banish from the kingdom a person who after becoming a sannyāsin does not abide by its rules (of celibacy &o.). It has been seen above that a man who falls away from the order of gannyāsins became a slave of the king for life (p. 185 ). Atri requires & sanngāsin not to stay even for a day in the place where live his father and mother, brother and sister, wife or son or daughter-in-law, his agnates or cognates or 

friends, or his daughter or her sons (Sm. Mu. p. 206 ). 

Originally these injunctions about complete restraint and abandonment of sexual life and total lack of property were faithfully followed by ascetics. The great hoārya Samkara was & celibate all his life, but he is said to have established four mathas as stated above (p. 907) for the propagation of his doctrines and philosophy at Sțngapura (modern Sšngeri) and other places. Pious devotees bestowed considerable donations on these mathas. In course of time these mathas went on increasing and huge properties came to be under the control of the pontiffs of these several mathas. There arose ten orders of advaita sannyāsins blone 2178 viz. tirtha, āsrama, vana, aranya, giri, parvata, sāgara, sarasvati, bhārati and puri, These ten orders are said to be the pupils in succession of the four disciples of Samkara i. e. the first two of Padmapada, the next two of Hastāmalaka, the next three of Trotaka (or Totaka) and the last three of Sures vara. The several mathas at Sșögeri, Kāñci, Kumbbakonam, Kudalgi, Sankeśvara, Sivagangā have been quarrelling among themselves as to their jurisdictions 2173 and their rights to claim monetary payments from the people and to exercise spiritual authority in matters of expiations, excommunication &o.

teaoberg 6174 and pupils appear to have been fabricated, no two of which agree in toto and in some of them Sureśvara is said to have lived for 700 or 800 years. The disciples of Ramānuja and Madhva also have many mathas of their own. Vallabha cārya ( one of the great ācāryas that interpreted the Vedanta sutras ) and his disciples do not accept the order of sannyāsa, According to them in the Kali age gannyāsa is forbidden for the seeker as it leads on to regret and worry 1716 ( if its rules are to be strictly observed) and that the parityāga (abandonment) that is the essence of sannyāsa does not consist in resorting to the 4th asrama but in behaving in the way in which bhaktas ( devotees ) like Uddhave acted ( vide Bhāgavata III. 4). Most of these mathas have large endowments or incomes which are spent in pomp and show (e. g. keeping golden images and paraphernalia ). Very few of the heads are really learned even in ancient Sanskrit Literature in all its branches, they are impervious to modern tendencies and requirements, are obscu. rantists and generally oppose all ideas of reform. Only a very few mathas are presided over by persons who have been celibate throughout their lives. Most of them originally were house holders and then took to sannyasa. Besides the succession to the gādi is often a hole and corner affair. When the incumbent is about to die the influential and intriguing persons round him catch hold of some aspiring householder, make him a disciple of the dying sannyāsin and afterwards he is installed as the pontiff.

He retains his attachment to his former family and uses & good deal of the income for his relatives and friends. Real reform of the mathas cannot come unless great improvements are made in selecting a suocessor. There must be several disciples, the selection must not be made on the incumbent's death-bed, representative bodies must have a voice in the selection. The heads of ascetic mathas bave often come to the courts on ques tions about dignity, jurisdiction and properties. For example, in 3 Moore's Indian Appeals p. 198 the Sệngeri Pontiff claimed a declaration that he alone was entitled to proceed on the public road in & palanquin crosswise and for an injunction restraining the Swami of the Lingayats from doing so; in Madhusudan Parvat v. Shree Madhav Teertha, 33 Bom, 278, the Samkaricārya of the Saradā matha at Dwarka sued for a declaration that the defendant was not entitled to the title and dignities of a Samkarācārya and that he was not entitled to call for or receive any offerings from people at Ahmedabad or other places in Gujarat either in his assumed capacity of a Samkarāoārya or as a Samkarāoārya of the Jyotir-matha (this claim was also rejected on the grounds that the suit was not of a civil nature and that the offerings were voluntary ). 

In Vidya Shankara v. Vidya Narsimha, 51 Bom. 442 (P.O.) the Privy Council had to deal with a pretty tangle of claims between four persons, the plaintiff and the defendant each claiming to be the lawful Samkarācārya of Sankeshwar and Karvir matha and both having selected & disciple to succeed them. These illustrations indicate how the world-renounoing ideal of conduct set forth by the great Šamkarācārya is honoured in modern times by those who swear by his name. They should lay to heart the words of the Jivanmuktiviveka and the quote tion in it from Medbātithi (pp. 158-159 ) \#175 viz." if an ascetic secures a matha as a fixed place of residence and thereon & sentiment of ownership arises in him bis mind will be disturbed when logs or expansion of the matha takes place; therefore an ascetio should not possess a matha nor should he have vessels of gold or silver for his use nor should he gather pupils round

In J. R. A. S. for 1925 pp. 479-486 Dr. J. N. Farquhar contributes & very learned article on the organization of the sannyāsins of the Vedānta. Therein he shows how Moslem armed fakirs molested and even killed Hindu ascetics, how Madhusudana Sarasvati approached the Emperor Akbar, how failing to get complete redress he initiated ksatriyas and vaisyas into seven out of the ten orders of sannyāsins and armed them, how these sannyāsins fought against the moslem fakirs and also among themselves, how even non-brahmin women are initiated into the giri and puri orders and how in Northern India the pure monastic orders are those of tirtha, asrama and sarasvati. This innovation later on led to serious consequences. The sannyāsins and fakirs infested the province of Bengal and their inoursions and depredations caused great alarm in the first days of the British rule (latter half of the 18th century 2178 ). This shows how the rule of ahimsa enjoined upon ascetios became perverted. Various estimates have been made about the number of persons in India professing to lead the ascetio life. They could easily have been 10 per cent of the population, partioularly in Northern India. They generally led very indolent, parasitic and dissolute lives. There are however, reasons to believe that in recent times the number of 80-called Bannyāsins is being substantially reduced owing to several causes. There have been swarms of monks and nuns in Christian countries also. Before the suppression of the monasteries by Henry VIII in England about 400 years ago, the number of monks, nuns and persons dependent on them was enormously large. Vide'English monks' by Geoffrey Basker ville, p. 285, (f. n. 2) where the figures of monks and nuns in England, France and Spain at various periods are given. 

According to both anoient and modern Hindu Law, when a man became & sannyāsin, he became cut off from his family and lost all his rights to property, partition and inheritance in that family. Vas. Dh. 8. 17. 52 lays down that those who resort to another aśrama ( i. e. vānaprastha or sannyāsa ) are excluded

from their share (in the family property ).8177 This result, however, does not follow by merely wearing the garments of a sannyāsin, but in order that this result may follow & person must have performed the necessary ceremonies for entering the order of sannyāsins. On the other hand whatever belongs to & sannyāsin such as his clothes, his sandals, his books would not devolve on bis blood relations as heirs but will go to his spiritual heir ( viz. his pupil). Vide Yaj. II. 137 and the Mit. thereon. These rules, however, do not apply to a sūdra turning an ascetio. He does not become severed from his family by entering the order of asceticism, unless a usage to that effect is established. Vide Somasundaram v. Vaithilinga, 40 Mad. 846 (at p. 869 ), Harishchandra v. Atir Muhmud, 40 Cal. 545, 

The most serious inroad, however, on the ideal of sannyāsa was made when people professing to be ascetics were allowed to have wives or concubines. The Vāyupurāņa (quoted in the Yati-dbarmasangraha p. 108 ) invokes dire consequences on him who after becoming & sannyāsin has sexual intercourse, viz. he becomes a worm in ordure for 60,000 years, passes through the lives of a rat, a vulture, a dog, a donkey, a pig, a tree without flowers and fruit, a goblin and then he is born AB & oandala, The Rājatarangini (III. 12 ) records 178 that when the queen of Meghavābana built a monastery she established in a portion of it ascetics who followed the rules of conduct laid down for their order and in the other portion ascetics, who were condemn able because of their acting like householders, together with their wives, sons, cattle and wealth. In the Presidenoy of Bombay several cases have come before the courts about the rights of succession to Gharbhari Gosavig8178 ( i. e, ascetios who have a house and family ). Vide Gosain Rambharti v. Mahant Surajbharti, 5 Bom. 68% ( where it was held that a Gosavi who succeeded as & disciple to a mohunt did not forfeit his rights by subsequent marriage ), Balgir v. Dhondgir, 5 Bom. L.

In the Gupta Inscriptions we have several records of a line of kings who were the feudatories of the imperial Guptas and who bear the appellation 'nȚpati-parivrājaka' (kingly ascetios). Fleet thinks (p. 95 n. 1) that the word means no more than what is conveyed by such words as 'rājarşi', but this is unconvincing. Their gotra was Bharadvāja and the founder is said to have been an inoarnation of Kapila (p. 115 ). It is likely that the founder, after being a king, ultimately became a sapnyasin and his descendants (in the fashion poetically described by Kalidasa ) also became ascetios after adorning the throne for some time. Hence they probably came to be called nrpati-pari vrājakas. It is interesting to note that Vyāsa quoted in Sm. M. (p. 176 ) and Yati-dh. (pp 2-3) forbade sannyāsa in the Kali age, though he made an exception to this extent that as long as the division of society into varpas existed and as long as the Veda was studied so long sannyāsa could be resorted to in the Kali age. 3180 Nāgesa in his Vrātyatāprāya citta-nirnaya (p. 46) makes the curious statement that according to the Sannyāse paddhati of Vyasa a wise brāhmaṇa should not resort to sannyāsa when 4400 years of the Kali age will have expired (i. e, after 1299 A. D.). 4181 This dictum was probably due not only to the difficulties of observing to the letter the code of life sketched for sanngāsins, but also to the fact that about 1299, the whole of India was being harassed by Moslem iove ders and adventurers who made the helpless gennyāsins the first target for their fanatio zeal and persecution. The Nirnaya sindhu (III, pūrvārdha, end) quotes the above verse of Vyāsa and remarks that this probibition of sannyāga is meant to apply to sangyāsa with three dandas. 

The Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 11-30, the Baud. gr. seşasūtra IV. 16, the Vaik. IX. 6-8 contain the procedure of becoming a sannyāsin. That of the Baud. Dh. S. being probably the most

ancient among extant works is briefly set out below : 8188 After having out the hair on the head, the beard, the hair on the body, the nails, he makes ready three sticks, a loop of strings, (a piece of cloth as ) a water strainer, a jar and a bowl. Having taken these he should go to the end of his village, or to the extremity of the boundary of his village, or the fire hall; he should partake of clarified butter, milk and ourds (mixed together) and should fast or drink water. Then he should recite the vyābstis separately preceded by 'om' and followed by the words 'I enter the Sāvitri' and by one pāda of the sacred Gayatri and then all together. 3188 Before sunget, he heaps fuel on the gārhapatya fire ( if he has maintained Vedio fires ), brings the anvāhāryapacana (daksiņāgni) to the spot, takes the flaming ahavaniye fire out of the gārhapatya, melts clarified butter on the garbapatya, cleanses it (with blades of kuša), takes four portions of the butter in the spoon called 'sruc' and offers in the chavaniya fire on which fuel-stioks have been heaped & full oblation (i. e. whole spoonful) four times saying 'om svāha'. This is oalled Brahmānvādhāna (putting fuel-sticks on fire for securing knowledge of brahman). Then in the evening after agnihotra has been offered, he strews grass to the north of the garbapatys fire, places on the grass sacrifolal vessels in pairs with the upper parts turned downwards, spreads darbha grass to the south of the āhavaniya fire on the Beat meant for the brabmi priest, covers it with black antelope skin and remains awake the whole of that night. Then he riges at the time (muhürta ) sacred to Brahmā and offers agnihotra in the early morning at the proper time. Then after covering the part of the altar called prsty and bringing water he prepares an offering for Agni Vaišvānara cooked on twelve pot sherds. That well-known işti will be the last he will perform, Afterwards, he throws in the ahavaniya fire those sacrificial vessels which are not made of stone or earth.

Repeating the mantra 'ya te agne yajñiya tanar' (Tai. S. III. 4. 10.5) he inhales the smell of the smoke of each of the three fires thrice. Then standing within the sacrificial enclosure he says thrice in a low voice and thrice aloud the words 'om bhüḥ, bhuvaḥ svah. I have entered the order of sannyasa ( lit. I have abandoned ), I have entered the order of sannyasa, I have entered the order of sannyasa'. Lastly he pours out as much water as will fill his joined hands saying 'I promise that no injury will proceed from me to any creature'. He must henceforward restrain his speech. He holds his staff saying 'thou art my friend, protect me'. He takes the sikya (loop of strings) with the words 'yadasya pāre rajasah (Tai. S. IV. 2.5.2); he takes the cloth for straining water with the text' yene devaḥ pavitropa' (Tai. Br. I. 4.8 and Nirukta V.6); he takes the water jar reciting 'yons deva jyotişordhyam' (Tai. S. V. 7. %. 2); he takes the bowl after reciting the seven vyāhţtis. Taking with him the staffs, the loop of strings, the cloth as a water strainer, the water-pot and the bowl he goes to a place where water can be had, bathes, sips water and sprinkles bimself ( performs mārjana ) with the Surabhimati 2184 verse ( dadhi-krāvạo, Rg. IV. 39. 6), with Ablingā verses, Vāruņi verses, Hiranyavarpā verses ( Tai. S. V. 6. 1.1= Atharvaveda I. 33. 1-4) and Pāva. māni verses (Rg. IX. 1 &e.). While still in the water be performs sixteen prāņāyāmas after ( mentally going over ) the Aghamarşaņa verses (Rg.

He then fills his joined hands with water and performs tarpaņa to the Manes just in the same way as he did to the gods, then he worships the sun with the two versos * udu tyam' ( Rg. 1. 50.1 ) and 'oitram ( Rg. I 115, 1). He then offers tarpana to the Atinan (self) with 'the syllable om is brahma; this light (the sun) that diffuses warmth is indeed

brabma; this which gives warmth is indeed the Veda ; this indeed that sheds warmth is the (proper ) object of knowledge'; then he worships the Atman with the words 'the Self is brahman, it is light'. Let him repeat the Gayatri verse one thousand times or an unlimited number of times. Repeating 

om bhurbhuvah svah'he takes up the water strainer (cloth ) and fetches water. Let him not thereafter perform acamana with water that has not been drawn up (from a well), wbiob has not been strained &186 and which has not been completely oleansed. Let him not wear thereafter whitegarments. He may carry one staff or three. He has to keep the following Vows: abimsā ( abstaining from injury to any creature), truth fulness, not depriving others of any property of theirs, continence, and liberality. There are five minor vratas ( vows) viz. absence of anger, waiting upon the guru, avoidance of care lessness ( or rashness ), cleanliness, purity in food. Then follow rules as to begging for alms ( some of them are at pp. 933-934 above). When he returns from begging, he places the alms in a pure spot, washes his hands and feet and announces (the alms ) first to the sun with the verses ' udu tyam' (Rg. 1. 50. 1) and' oitram '(Rg. I. 115.1); he also announces the alms to brahman with the text' brahma jajñānam' (Tai. S. IV. . 8. 2 

Atharvaveda IV. 1.1). It is declared ( in Vedic texts) that after the brahmadhāna the sacred fires are contained in the sacrificer himself; bis prapa, apāna, vyāna, udāna and sanāna represent the five fires gārbapatya, anvāhāryapacana (dakşi pāgni), ābavaniya, sabhya and dvasathya. These five fires indeed abide in the Atman; he, therefore, offers (the oblations) in the Atman only. This sacrifice offered in the soul, which is centred in and based on the Atman, leads the soul to bliss. Giving compassionately portions of the alms to creatures and sprinkling the remainder with water, he should partake of it as if it were some medicine. After he has eaten and taken &camana he worships the sun with the Jyotişmati *187 verse viz.'ud vayam' ( Rg. I. 50. 10) after inaudibly muttering the

Now they quote the following rules for the case where the teachers explain the Upanişad 'standing ( in the day ), keeping silence, sitting (at night) in the postureista of crossed legs, bathing thrice a day, he shall subsist entirely on rice grains, oil-cake, food from barley, sour milk and milk'. It is declared in Vedic texts on that occasion be shall keep strict silence and converse as much as is necessary with the teaobers deeply versed in the three vedas, with ascetios or other learned persons in the several asramas, after pressing the teeth together, all the while contemplating on wbat he hears, but not in such & way as would cause a breach of his vow. He may keep only one of the rules out of the three viz, standing (in the day), rigid silence and sitting with crossed legs (at night) and not all together. Eight things do not cause him who is intent on vows as above to break his own vow viz. water, roots, clarified butter, milk, sacri. ficial food, the wish of a brābmapa, an order of his guru, and medicine. Let him mutter the mantras in the evening and morning that are repeated in the Agnihotra. He should perform his evening sandhyā adoration with mantras addressed to Varu pa 5188 and in the morning with those addressed to Mitra (Rg. III. 59). It is declared in the Veda 'limited in number are the rk verses, the sāmans and the yajus formulæ, but there is no limit to this that is brahma.' In this way (i. e. repeating om ) the ascetio may give up the rest of the Veda, but should stand firm by the root of the Veda (viz. om). The Veda is the tree and its root is pranaya (om). He should meditate on 'om'. Prajapati has declared that prapava leads on to union with brahman. Let him cleanse the vessel of brahman with seven vyāhftis. 2189

Among medieval works the Smrtyarthasāra (pp. 96-97), the Sm. M. (pp. 177-182 ), the Yati-dh. (pp. 10-22 ), the Nirnaya-sindhu (III. Uttarardha pp. 628-632), the Dharma sindhu give various detailed procedures. Many of the medie val works and manuals (paddhatis) on sannyāsa frequently refer to a work called Brahmanandi, which I have not been able to secure. The procedure in the Dharmasindhu contains the following elements, Sannyasa is to be resorted to in the northward passage of the sun and for a man who is about to die even in the southward passage. He should find out a teacher possessed of the virtues of quiescence and note for three months the duties of ascetios in his company, should purify himself with japa of the sacred Gayatri, Rudra mantras and by Kuşmapda homa (for which see Tai. Ār. II. 7). He should then make a sankalpa 1190 after reciting the place and time on & riktā tithi and should perform the prayascitta of catuḥkȚcchra by giving a cow or money for each as stated above (pp. 199-200). Then he should begin to perform on the 11th or 12th day 16 srāddhas of himself and sapiņdikarana. Then be is to perform eight śrāddhas (vide above p. 932 ) and tarpana as a subordinate part (anga ) of these sight srāddhas. On the day these eight brāddbas are performed or on the next day he should shave off the whole head after keeping six hairs out of his top-knot, pare bis nails, then take his bath, then he is to donate to brāh maņas and his sons all his wealth except his wearing apparel and the materials for homa. The garments he is to wear should be dyed with red obalk; he should secure a bamboo staff as high as his head &o. and as thick as his finger and brought by a brāhmaṇa; that staff should be sprinkled over with water from a conoh to the accompaniment of 'om', the purusa bymn (Rg. X. 90) and such names (of Vişnu) as Keśava. He should also keep ready a water jar, a strip for his loins and a garment to cover his body and a wallet and pādukās (sandals). He should declare bis resolve (sankalpa) to become a parama. hamsa and perform the worship of Ganesa, puṇyāhavācana, worship of mother goddesses and Nāndi-brāddha. He should then perform japa by saying "namah' to Brabma ( in the dative), Vişnu, Rudra, Sürya, Soma, Atman, Antarktman, Paramatman and also repeat the first pādas of each of the four

Vedas. He should then eat three handfuls of barley flour with 'om' and touch his navel. He should then sip thrice clarified butter or water mixed with milk and curds repeating the mantras 'trivrd-asi', 'pravşd-asi', 'vivrd-asi' (all three in Vāj. S. 15. 9) and then drink water with the mantra 'may the waters purify' (Tai. Ār. 10. 23), then perform acamana and declare his resolve to fast. Then comes Sāvitripravesa (as in Baud. above); then he should kindle his grhya fire or if he has no gphya fire then he should bring domestio fire with the mantra 'prsto divi' (Rg. VII. 5. 27) and kindle it with the three mantras tat savitu}', 'tām savituh' and 'yisyāni deva' (Rg. III. 62. 10, Vāj. S. 17. 74, Rg. V. 82.5). Then comes brahmanvādhana before sunset (see above p. 954). He should thereafter perform evening sandhya adoration, homa and vaišvadava and keep awake the whole night near the fire. Then the next morning after the daily homa and Vaišvadeva he should offer a mese of cooked food to Agni or Vais vānara and perform the home to prāpa and others, the puruşasūkta boma and Viraja homa. The Viraja homa is a lengthy performance and the principal elements in it are : the offering of 40 oblations of each out of the three viz. fuel-sticks, boiled rice and clarified butter after repeating certain formulas such as 'may my five prāṇas be purified, may I be light (Illumination ) free from rajıs (the principle of activity or obstruction) and from evil, svābā ; this is for the prāșa and the rest, it is not mine.' In this way oblations are offered to five senses, the mind, buddhi, seed, thought and sankalpa, to the constituents of the body, to the several limbs of the body ( head, hands and feet &o.), to puruşa and otbors, to the five elements, to the five guņas of the elements, to the five kośas (sheaths) and several others. Then an oblation of ajya is made to Prajāpati. Then he should recite the Puruşa hymn (Rg. X. 90 ) and the first sentences of the four Vedas, offer oblations to Agni Sviştakrt, distribute gifts to students and others, he should burn his wooden utensils in his gļhya fire if he has kept one and donate the metal vessels to his guru, then he should deposit the fire in himself by reciting' ayam te yoniņ'( Rg. III. 29. 10 ) and 'yā te agne yajñiya' (Tai. 8. III. 4. 10, 5) thrice and should face and take in the blaze and warmth of his grhya fire, should take a black antelope skin and leave his house. He should give blessings to his song and other near relatives and bid good-bye to them with the words to me belongs no one nor do I belong to any one.' Then he should go to a reservoir of water, take in his folded hands water and offer it 

960 

. 

History of Dharmajāstra 

(Ch. XXVIII 

to all gods with the hymn Rg. X. 103 (1-13). He should deolare 8 resolve to resort to sannyāsa for the realization of brahman and offer three handfuls of water in the reservoir. He should then discharge water into the reservoir from his joined hands saying 'I have given up the bankering for song, wealth, worlds and for everything, may there be safety to all creatures from me, svāba.' Then he should again declare that he has abandoned everything, all pleasures, all sentiments of anger &o., all joys of flowers, scents, dancing and music, all duties of varna and asramas &c.; he should also declare 'I shall not cause any injury to any creature in thought, word or by the body; may all creatures have no fear of me.' He should think of the sun and other gods as witnesses to this declaration and standing in navel-deep water should again perform the Savitripraveśa and offer water in declaring 'I have risen beyond the desire for song, worlds and wealth and shall practise begging.' 

After this comes the utterance of the praisa (the call or direction). In a low, moderate and loud voice the entrant should declare 'om, bhūḥ I have given up everything, om bhuvah, I have ........., om svaḥ, I have........., om bhür bhuvab svaḥ, I have given up everything and should discharge water in the reservoir of water with the words 'may there be no injury to all creatures from me, svāhā.' He should pluok out the top knot, take out his sacred thread and hold them in his hand and offer them in water with water with the words 'water is indeed all deities, I sacrifice ( the top-knot and sacred thread) to all gods, svāha' and then he should send up a prayer to Vasudeva. Then he should remove his wearing apparel and walk five steps with his face to the north. Then the doārya should bow to the entrant and should hand over to the latter a piece of loin oloth and upper garment and a staff. The entrant should wear them and hold the staff with appropriate mantras and also a water jar and an asana (& soat). He should then hold a fuel-stick in his hand, bow to his guru, sit down in the eagle posture and make a request to the guru in the words 'Oh teacher, who are like the Lord of the Universe to me, save me who am scorched by the fire of samsāra and who am bitten by Death; I have thrown myself on your meroy' and also repeat the verse' yo brahmanam' (Svetasvatara Up.

waited upon the guru with these words and placing bis right knee on the ground, he should clasp the feet of his guru and should say teach, Sir, brahma to me.' The guru should contemplate on bis soul as brahman, should recite over a conch full of water the sacred syllable 'om' twelve times, should pour the water from the conch on bis disciple, should recite the propitiatory verse som no mitraḥ' ( Rg. I. 90, 9 ), then lay his hand on the head of the disciple, should recite the Puruşa hymn (Rg. X. 90), should place his hand on the heart of the disciple and mutter the mantra 8192 'I place thy heart in disciplined obedience to me,' the guru should then mutter in the rigbt ear of the disciple the syllable'om' and should enlighten him about the signi. ficance of 'om' and of pañcikarana;2183 he should then impart to the disciple one of the four great Vedānta sentences ( mahavākya) * prajñānam brahma' (Ait. Up. III.3), 'ayam-ātmā brahma' (Bļ. Up. II. 5. 19), 'tat tvain-asi' (Chin. Up. VI. 8. 7), 'aham brahmāsmi' (Bț. Up. I. 4. 10) in accordance with the tradition of his school and enlighten him about the meaning thereof. Then he should give to the disciple a name ending in tirtha, asrama &o. according to the tradition of bis order. Then the guru may bring about what is called paryankaśauca and give to the disciple the yogapatta. 

The paryanka-sauca ( purification by being seated on a stool &c. ) may be briefly described. On an auspicious day a house bolder seats the ascetic in front of himn on a wooden stool or seat, places five heaps of earth to his left and also to his right and also pure water on both sides. Then the householder simultaneously washes the two knees of the ascetio with water and earth from the first heap of earth on the left. Then he should wash his own left hand with earth and water taken from the half of the first heap on the right and with the remain

ing half of the first heap on the right he should wash both his hands seven times with the same water. With the second heap on the left he should wash simultaneously the two thighs (jangha ) of the ascetio four times and with one half of the second heap on the right he should wash his own left hand geven times and with the other half of the second heap (on the right ) he should wash both his hands four times. The ankle, the upper part of the foot and the lower part ( sole ) of the foot of the ascetic are respectively washed with the third, fourth and fifth heap on the left and his own left hand and both hands are washed a certain varying number of times with 3rd, 4th, 5th heaps on the right. 

The yogapatta (lit. the cloth of yoga, union with Spirit) is given in the following way: After the ascetic bas under gone paryankaśauoa, he should cleanse bis waist, wear & string round his waist and his loin cloth and cover his waist with a piece of cloth. He should then sit with his guru's permission on a high seat and should propound some Vedanta topio in the presence of the persons assembled. The ascetic guru should sprinkle on the head of his ascetio disciple water from a conch to the accompaniment of the Puruşa hymn (Rg. X. 90 ), should honour him by offering clothes, sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya. He (the guru ) should hold a piece of cloth over the head of the disciple, recite along with the other patis the chapter called Visvarūpa (11th chapter of the Bhagavadgita ) from the 15th verse to the 33rd Verse. He should then give the name already determined upon to the disciple and say to him 'Henceforward you may admit to Barnpyāsa one who is eligible for it, initiate him and give him the yogapatta.' Then the disciple bows to the yatis older than himself. Then the guru gives to the disciple & waist-thread and a staff marked with five mudrās and should offer his own salutation to the disciple aocording to the tradition of his order. Other ascetics and house-holders also should bow to the disoiple, who should only repeat the word 'Narayana,' should leave the high seat and seat his guru thereon, should bow to the guru according to the rules of the order and to the other ascetios.

Samnyāsa-for the dying 

963 

The Jābalopanişad (5) 8185 allows samnyāsa to those even who are suffering from disease and are about to die, all that is required being that they should declare in words and resolve in their mind to enter the order of samnyāga. No exten. sive ceremonial is required. Angiras and Sumantu quoted in 8m. M. (pp. 174 and 182 ) state 'when a man is shattered by old age or harassed by his enemies or is suffering from ( an incurable) disease he may resort to saṁngāsa by merely uttering the praişa (vide above p. 960 ) and no further rites would be absolutely necessary. He should recite thrice in the morning, at noon and in the evening, 'I have given up everything (or entered upon samnyāsa ) and further say 'I forswear whatever action I may have done through ignorance, indolence or carelessness; I shall cause no barm to creatures with my hands or feet, with my speech, body or mind; may all creatures have no fear from me.' The Dharmasindhu ( III, uttarārdha ) says that in this samnyāsa for those at the door of death the absolutely essential elements are the resolve ( sam. kalpa ), the uttering of the praişa and the giving of the promise of non-injury and the rest of the rites may or may not be performed according to circumstances. Even now such a gamnyāsa ( called āturasamnyāsa ) is sometimes resorted to by religious-minded men in extremis, the only essentials gone through being sankalpa (declaration of resolve), kşaura (tonsure of the head), sāvitripraveś& ( described above at p. 954 ) and praişocoara ( utterance of praisa ). 

One question on which controversies have raged from very ancient times is whether an ascetic should give up his top koot and sacred thread also. The Jābālopanişad 3186 (5) states

that Atri asked Yajšavalkya how a man who did not wear & yajñopavita (when he became an ascetic) could still be a brāh maņa and that the great søge replied that in the case of the ascetic the Self was bis yajāopa vita and the same Upanişad (6) states that the paramahamsa is to abandon in water the three dapdas, the water-jar, the šikya, the begging bowl, the water strainer, the topknot and yajñopa vita and should be a geeker after the Self. In the Aruņika Up. (2) it is said *197 that he should discharge bis yajñopavita on the earth or in water and that he should give up his sikha and the sacred thread. Samkara in his bhāşya on Br. Up. III. 5. 1 sets out at some length the arguments and the authorities on both sides and ultimately gives it as his own view that the sacred thread and sikha should be given up by the ascetio. Visvarüpa on Yāj. III. 66 also discusses this matter and propounds the same view. On the other hand Vṛddha-Harita8198 VIII. 57 deolares 'if an ascetio gives up the acts peculiar to brāhmaṇas, viz. keeping & topknot and wearing a sacred thread, he becomes & cāndāls wbile alive and is born a dog after death.' The Jivanmukti viveka (p. 6 ff.) and Par. M. I. part 2, p. 164 ff. discuss this point and arrive at the same conclusion as Samkara. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 58 gives an option. In modern times saṁnyisips give up these two. 

Some special rules are laid down about the āhnika ( daily rites ) of ascetics.8199 They have to perform sauca, brusbing the teeth, bath, just as house-holders have to do. Manu V. 137 (=Vas. Dh. S. VI. 19, Vişņu Db. S. 60.26, Sankba 16. 23-24) says that forest hermits and ascetios have respectively to per form three and four times as much sauoa ( bodily purification) 88 house-holders. As to food, it has already been seen (p. 935) that they are to eat only once and only eight morsels. Ascetics have to worship Puruşottama (i, e. Vasudeva with his four forms ), Vyasa ( with his four pupils, Sumantu, Jaimini, Vaisampayapa, Paila ), the Bhāşyakāra Samkara ( with his four pupils ) and so on. Certain rules are laid down for an ascetio as regards

giving and receiving honour or salutation. An ascetio should bow to gods and to older ascetics who act according to the rules of their order, but should not offer namaskāra to an house-holder even if the latter be well-conducted. If another person bows to an ascetic, the latter should not pronounce any benediction but should only utter the word8200 Nārāyaṇa.' When an ascetio (even one who has taken samnyāsa on his death-bed) dies, he is to be buried and not cremated. No mourning is to be observed for a yati when he dies (Atri 97 ) and no śrāddhas are to be offered on his death except the pārvana on tbe 11th day after death (vide Apararka p. 538). If an asoetio hears of the death of his son or any other relative, he does not become impure and has not to bathe but on hearing of his mother's or father's death he has to bathe, though he observes no mourning \#2002 

According to the theory of Dharmaśāstra, the king is not only the head of the civil administration and the fountain of justice, but he is also the final controlling authority in presery ing religious and spiritual institutions, he is to see that people follow the dharma, to punish them for breaches of the religious and spiritual codes and to see to the administration to them of appropriate penances. In short, he is also the Defender of the Faith. Vide Gaut. XI. 9-11, Vişnu Dh. S. III. 2-3, Narada ( prakirņaka ) verses 5-7, Yāj. I. 337 and 359, Atri 17-20, Manu VII. 13. But he regulated spiritual and religious matters not by his arbitrary authority but on the advice of his purohita and ministers and after taking the opinion of the assemblies (parişad) of learned men. Whenever difficult questions arose about the validity of anytbing from the religious point of view or about penances for lapses, or about excommunicating or outcasting a man the opinion of the assembly of learned men was sought. Therefore, detailed rules are laid down in the Dharmasutras and smrtis about the constitution of pari şads. In modern times, the British Government being neutral in matters religious or ecolesiastical, the ascetio hoads of the various mathas have been in the habit of assuming to themselves jurisdiction

over persons professing to follow their dogmas in ecclesiastical matters such as presoribing penances for lapses, settling disputes between castes, and deciding upon questions of outcasting. A few words must be said about the parişads and about the claims of the Samkarācāryas ( the modern heads of mathas ) to regulate religious matters affecting their followers. 

Among the oldest texts on this point is the one contained in the Tai. Up. I. 11. viz. the exhortation of the teacher on the eve of the student's departure at the close of his studies.2201 'If you have hereafter a doubt about any rite or about a course of conduct, you should behave in the way in which the brahmanas of your place, who are thoughtful, intent(upon doing their duties), aot spontaneously ( without being urged by any one), are not hard-hearted and have an eye only to dharma (and not to kāma or artha) will behave. The same holds good about your conduct towards persons obarged (generally falsely) with sins or lapses'. 

The words 'sabb&'( Rs. X. 34. 6 ) and 'samiti' (Rg. X. 97.6) ooour even in the Rigveda but their exact significance is doubt ful and the former word at least seems to bear the sense of 

gambling hall' in some passages. In the Upanişads, however, the words samiti and parişad assume & more definite sense, meaning an assembly of learned men in a particular locality'. The Chan. Up. V.3. 1 states that Sretaketu Ārupeya 2803 repaired to the assembly (samili) of the Pancalas ( where Prayābana Jaivali put him five questions of a metaphysical and esoteric nature ). The Bę. Up. VI. 2. 1 when narrating the same episode employs the word ' parişad'. These passages establish that in the times of the Upanişads there were assemblies of learned mon where intricate questions were discussed. Gaut. 28, 46 prescribes just as the Tai. Up. I. 11 does that in matters about which there is no certain rule ( or there is doubt ) one should do what is commended by respectable persons not less than ten in number, who are clever in discussion and are above covetous noss.4203 The Ap.

than those stated by him may be observed as settled by parişads. The Baud. Dh, S. II. 1. 44-45 prescribes "the relatives of a brahmacārl who is guilty of sexual intercourse should empty a water pot in the parişad and the offender should confess 'I, 80 and so by name, am guilty of such and such a misdeed' and that after the erring person has performed penance and when he bas touched water, milk, gbee, honey and salt, the brāhmaṇas should ask him “have you performed tho penance ?' The other shall then reply yes'; then they shall admit him who has performed penance to all sacrificial rites making no difference between him and others."2204 This clearly establishes that at least five centuries before the Christian ere it was the privilege of the assembly of the learned brābmaņas to administer penance to a sinner and then restore him to all rights of interdining and otber social intercourse. Vas. Db. S. I. 16 declares there is no doubt that whatever persons who have studied dharmaśāstra and the three Vedas expound as purifying themgelves and others is tbe proper dharma.' Ap. Db. S. I. 1. 1. % declares tbat the conventions of those that know dharma are the authoritative standard (of conduct for ordinary men). When the smộtis declare that Veda, smrti and the usages of gistas are the three sources of dharma (e. g. Vas. Dh. S. I. 4-5) they convey that siştas can and should determine from time to time what is religious conduct. When Bphaspati enjoins that doubts about dharma should not be settled by blindly following the letter of śāstras, but that logic and reasoning should be employed, be strikes the true note of the spirit of the ancient sages. 8804x Vide also Manu XII. 106 and Gaut. XI. 23-24 for the importance of tarka in settling matters of dharma. Madu XII. 108 states if one were to ask how one should act in matters of dharma on which no express rule is declared in this work, the reply is that in such cases what is declared to be a proper rule of conduct by respectable (sista) brābmanas would undoubtedly be the dharms. Yāj. III. 300 requires that a person guilty of a sin or lapse should declare it to an assem bly of learned brahmaņas and undergo such vrata ( penance and

observanoes) as is approved of by the parişad. Samkarāoārya in his bhagya on Bệ. Up. IV. 3. 2 makes the very significant £205 remark" it is therefore that in coming to a decision on a subtle point of dharma, it is desirable to have a parişad working and & specially distinguished person is wanted ( to give the lead) as stated in the rule'a parişad should consist of not less than ten persons or of three or of one ( specially distinguished )'." These several authorities establish that for over 1500 years before the great Samkarācārya the parişad of learned brāhmaṇas was the acknowledged authority for settling doubtful points of dharma and administering penances on lapses from proper conduct, and that Samkarācārya himself acknowledged this pri vilege of the parişad. . 

The next question is: what is the number of persons required to constitute & parişad for deciding on doubtful points of dharma and what their qualifications should be. According to Gaut. 28. 46-47 a parişad should consist of at least ten 2206 persons viz. four, each of whom has mastered one Veda, three members who are respectively a perpetual ) student, & house-holder and a samnyāsin and three more each of whom has studied distinct dharmasastras. Vag. Dh. S. III, 20, Baud. I. 1.8, Parāśara VIII. 27 and Angiras declare that four persons each of whom has mastered one of the four Vedas, one who knows the Mimānsā, one who has studied the six subsidiary lores of the Veda, one who has studied dharmaśāstra and three persons who are a house-bolder, & forest hermit and a saṁnyasin constitute a parişad of ten. Manu XII.111 defines the ten as con sisting of three masters of each of the three Vedas (excluding the Atharvaveda), one who has studied Logic, a student of Mimarnsa, & student of Nirukta, a master of dharmaśāstras and three members in each of the first three asramas. Bphaspati 2207 quoted in Par. M. II. 1 p. 218 declares that a parişad may be constituted by seven or five persons sitting together who have studied the Vedas, their six subsidiary lores and dbarmaśāstra and that such & parişad resembles a solemn

sacrifice. Vide also Angiras quoted by Aparārka p. 23 for seven or ive men as constituting a parizad. Vas. Dh. 8. III. 7, Yaj. I. 9, Manu XII.112, Parāśara VIII. 11 state that at least four or three men should constitute a parişad, but they should be students of each of the four Vedas, should be agnihotrips and should have also studied dharmaśāstra. If even three cannot be found then even a single man oan declare the dharma in case of doubt (Gaut. 28.48), but he must possess special qualifications. Gaut. 28. 48, Manu XII. 113( = Atri 143) require that he must be the best of brāhmaṇas, & śişta and a deep student of the Vede. Yaj. I. 9, Parāśara VIII. 13, Angirasa208 say that a single person who is the best among ascetics possessing know ledge of the Self may form & parişad and declare what the pro. per rule is on a point of doubt. Though the texts permit in extreme cases a single man to declare dharma in case of doubt they give emphatio warning that this should not be done as far as possible. Baud. Dh, S. 1 1.13 observe89209 'the way of dharma is very subtle and diffioult to follow and it has many entrances (i. e. it appears different in different oircumstances); therefore 8 person though knowing much should not undertake single handed to propound the proper course of conduct in case of doubt.' The texts also emphasize that doubtful points of dharma are not to be decided by the votes of ignorant people, even if they muster in thousande. Manu XII. 114-115 ( =Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 17 and 12=Vas. Dh. S. III. 5-6=Parāśara VIII. 6 and 15 ) state Even if thousands of brāhmapas who have observed no vrata and who have studied no Vedio mantras and who make their living merely by virtue of their caste come together they do not constitute a parişad. When suoh foolish persona deluded by ignorance and ignorant of dharma declare (a penance for a sin) the sin is multiplied a hundred-fold and reaches the propounders.' 

The Mit, on Yaj. III. 300 remarks that the number mention ed an constituting a parişıd is not material, that all that is meant is that for lesser sing a small number of learned men can

(Ch. XXVIII 

declare the penance, but in the case of serious sins, the number of persons who constitute the parişad should be large. Devala8810 quoted in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 300 says that when the sin is not grave, brahmanas may declare the penance without reference to the king ( and restore the sinner to his privileges ) but when the sin is grave, then the king and brahmanas must carefully examine the matter and then declare the penance. Parasara (VIII. 28-29) ordainseeni 'brābmaņas should deolare penance for sing with the king's congent, that they should not declare the expiation of sins by penance of their own motion and that if the king decides to give prāyagoitta without reference to brahmanas, the sin becomes increased a hundred-fold.' It is the duty of the parişad to declare an appropriate penance when a man comes to it, declares his lapse and seeks to be freed from the taint and if the parişad knowing what the appropriate penanoe is refuses to administer it, they inour the same sin as that committed by the man who approaches them.4818 Paragara VIII, 2 prescribes that one should on being convinced of his having committed & sin at once repair to the assembly of learned men, should prostrate himself on the ground before them and request them to administer prāyaścitta ( expiation). The Mit. on Yāj. III. 300 quotes Parāśars that the sinner should announce his sin after offering the present of a cow or a bull or the like to the parişad. 

It will be shown immediately below that these rules of the emptis were observed to the letter by Hindu kings and learned brahmanas in medieval times. When the successors of Samkara cārya began to interest themselves in the work done by the parigads for centuries before the advent of the first acārya cannot be ascertained. A large part of Northern India was under Moslem rule for about 500 years from about 1200 A, D. and a portion of the Deocan and a part of South India also were under Moslem rule for about three hundred years.

who made unique contributions to the elucidation of Maratha History, Marathi Philology and Marathi Literature) and his friends. From these it appears that during the time of the Maratba domination learned brahmanas of holy places like Paithan, Nasik and Karad were consulted in religious matters by the king or his minister, that the holders of the 'gadi' of Samkarācārya at Sankaśvara and Karavira and other seats were also rarely consulted in these matters and that it is only after the advent of the British rule that 8818 the Samkarācargas have begun to claim almost exclusive jurisdiotion in ecolesiastic matters and in restoring men to their castes or excommunicato ing them for lapses. It will be seen from passages quoted below that both the learned brāhmapas at holy places like Karad and the Samkarācāryas claim the exclusive right in these matters by reason of immemorial usage, 

In several works it is said that the parişad must be consti. tuted by sistas ( vide Gaut. 28. 46). Sista is variously defined by some smộti works. The Baud. 2814 Db. S.(1. 1. 5-6) says *Sistas are those who are free from onvy and pride, who keep only as much oorn as is measured by kumbhi ( vide p. 111 f. n. 235 ), who are free from greed and from hypocrisy, arrogance, covetousness, delusions and anger. Those are giştas who have studied the Veda acoording to the prescribed method, together with its appendages ( viz. Itibāsa and Puranas ), who know how to draw inferences from that and who tend to make people realiza the teaching of the Veda.' The Mahābhāşya defines šiştas in almost the same words as Baud. Dh. S. I. 1.5. Vas. Dh. 8. 1. 6 defines šişts as one whose mind is free from desires.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Ch. XXVIII 

The Matsyapurana 1818 145. 34-38 and Vayu, vol. I. 59. 33-35 derive the word sista and restriot it to Manu, the seven sages and other similar great sages, who in each aon (Manvantara or yuga ) settle the rules of conduct for suoceeding ages. 

It is well-known that Shivaji, the great founder of the Maratha Empire, established a council of eight ministers, viz. Mukhya Pradhāna, Amatya, Saciva, Mantri, Senapati, Pandita rao, Nyāyadhisa and Sumanta. "The jurisdiction of the Panditarao extended over 2016 all religious matters, he was to oxamine and decide disputes about dharma and adharma, he was to honour šistas ( respectable people) on behalf of the king, wag to make his signature expressing his approval of the writings ( decisions ) about ācāra, vyavahāra and prāyasoittas (made by learned brābmaņas ). He was to superintend and carry into immediate execution gifts, propitiatory rites (for the king ).' This shows that even in matters of prāyasoitta (ponance for lapses and sins ) the final control rested with the Papditarao, who used to send doubtful matters to learned brahmanas at holy places like Wai, Nasik, Karad for their opinions and accept them. There are letters which show that the Panditarao convened meetings of learned brāhmaņas and with their approval declared prāyasoitta in the case of a brahmapa who had been forcibly converted by Mahomedans and who was thereafter restored to caste, 

That sometimes the Pontiff of the Sankeśvara matha was consulted even in disputes about rights to lands and villages follows from a decision contained in Rao Bahadur Vad's work pp. 203-210 ( of 1730 A.D.). Here a dispute arose between Sri karāoārya (to whom a villaga had been donated by king Rajārāma) and his agnates, who, taking advantage of the fact that the gift. deed was made in the name of five persons including Srikari. odrya, put forward their claims to that village. This dispute was referred to the Svāml of Sankeśvara and Karavirs who decided on the authority of Vijāāneśvara, the Vyavabārama yükha and the Dānakamalakara that though the document was

On the other hand in numerous instances the assembly of learned brāhmaṇag was approached either by the Papditarao or by the interested parties themselves to declare the proper penance and restore the guilty party to his caste. 218 Numerous docu. ments and letters showing the part played by the family of Gijre at Karad (in the Satara District) in the matter of giving deci. sions on questions of dharma-śāstra have been published by the late Mr. V. K. Rajvade. One Gangadhara Ranganatha Kulkarni of Hargul 28184 was forcibly converted by the Moslems; then the Maratha king Sambhaji ordered his minister the Panditarao to restore him to his caste after giving him appro priate prāyascitta and the Paņditarao called a meeting of learned brāhmaṇas, looked into works like the Mitākşarā and with the approval of the brāhmaṇas administered prāyasoitta to him and sent him on a pilgrimage.

It may be noted in passing that Raje Netaji Palkar who was one of the great commanders under Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire, was made & moslem by the Mogul Emperor Aurangzeb and was subsequently taken back into the Hindu fold by Shivaji. In another document 3120 the learned brahmanas of Poona, 46 in number, write to the brāhmaṇas of Karavira about one Narasimha Bhatta Toro of Paithan who had engaged as a priest in a Vedio saorifice in which he had offered the effigy of an animal made of flour, who had therefore been made outoast and who was subsequently restored to the caste after undergoing penance. 

The above brief account will show that for hundreds of years even before the first Samkarācārya flourished it was the privilege of the assembly of learned brāhmaṇas to decide doubt ful points of religious conduct and prescribe penances for lapses, that the same privilege continued undisturbed till the advent of the British rule, that rarely the heads of the mathas, by virtue of their eminent position, their supposed detachment from and renunciation of worldy affairs and their reputation as ascetios, were asked to decide (following Yāj. I. 9) doubtful points of religious and theological importance, that it is only during the last few decades that such heads began to claim exclusive jurisdiction in such matters. 

It is desirable in the interest of the solidarity of tha several Hindu castes and the rapid growth of progressive and advanced views that matters of practices, penances and restoration to oaste should be in the hands of the bodies of learned men or the caste itself than in the hands of a single ascetic styling himself Sarkarācārya, who often happens to know nothing of dharma sastra and only puts his seal of approval on what interested persons that are round him say.

Samnyāsa-aspects of 

975 

After this review of the stage of samnyāga we see that asceticism presents several aspects viz. fasting or at least reducing the intake of food, abstention from meat and drink and pleasures of sense, total absence of sexual gratification and suppression of the sexual emotion, yow of silence, sleeping on - bare ground, nakedness or making use of minimum clothing, contempt for the world and its riches. The Hindu Scriptures however do not enjoin self-infiction of pain or flagellation that was indulged in by monks in the early centuries of Christianity, Asceticism in the several forms indicated above is a feature oommon to all religions. It is the fashion to assert that Indians't have the highest regard for asceticism and that the men whose memories they cherish as ideals of human conduct are ascetics. This statement is only partially true. Christ also taught abandonment of worldly ties and the spurning of riches as the best for entering the Kingdom of Heaven ( vide Matthew 19. 21, Luke 14. 26 and 33, St. John %. 15-16). It is only during the last three or four hundred years that Western peoples have given up much of what was thought for centuries to be the main teaching of Christ and regard suocessful men of action or politicians or men of martial exploits as their ideals and beroes. In India also martial glory has often raised men to the position of heroes or avatāras, but only when they delivered their countrymen from the tyranny and persecution of evil men or foreigners. Parasurama, Rāme and Krşņa are avatāras because they fought against tyranny and barbarity and not because they brought as large a slice of the earth under their domination as possible for purposes of exploitation or vainglory. Martial exploits for self-aggrandisement or for domination for domination's sake have never evoked great enthusiasm in India. Shivaji, the great hero of the Marathas, was paid almost divine honours even during his life-time not for his martial exploits, but for his baving freed the Marathas and other peoples from Moslem tyranny, perseoution, religious Intolerance and fanaticism.

CHAPTER XXIX 

SRAUTA ( VEDIC) SACRIFICES* 

Introductory A deep study of Vedio saorifices is quite essential for the proper understanding of the Vedio Literature, for arriving at approximately correct statements about the obronology, the development and the stratification of the different portions of that Literature and for the influence that that Literature exerted on the four varnas and the caste-system, on the splitting up of the brāhmaṇas themselves among several sub-castes 88% and on the institution of gotras and pravaras. Early European scholars generally paid scant attention to the deep study of the Vedio sacrifices and endeavoured to understand the meaning of the Vedas principally by reference to grammar, comparative philology and the comparison of several passages containing the same word or words. Max Müller put forward a tentative soheme of chronology based mostly on subjective considera tions and prompted by the great prejudice felt by European scholars generally against admitting any great antiquity for the Vedas. Therefore the endeavour of most European scholars has been to show that the mantras could not have been composed before 1400 B.O. It is beyond the scope of this work to enter into any discussion about the dates of the various sections of the Vedio Literature. It must be here said, however, that I do not subscribe to the view that 1400 B, O. is the uppermost limit of the original composition of the Vedio hymns. The hymns may have been composed for aught we know several thousand years

before tbat date. Most of the Vedic Samhitās that we now bave are arranged (except the Rgveda to some extent) definitely for the various aspects of the cult of the sacrifice and indicate a state of things when different priests were required for the sacrifices, who used mantras from the collections they had studied, 

For a thorough understanding of Vedic sacrifices, the several Veda Sambitās, the Brāhmaṇas and the Srauta sūtras must be carefully studied. Among works in English that are very helpful must be mentioned, Haug's translation ( with notes ) of the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, Prof. Eggeling's translation of the Satapatha Brābmaņa with notes (S.B. E. vol. XII, XXVI, XLI, XLIII, XLIV), Prof. Keith's 'Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanişads', translation of the Blaok Yajurveda (2 volc in Harvard Oriental Series) and of the Rigveda Brāhmaṇas (one volume in the same series ), Kunte's 'Vicis situdes of Aryan civilization in India.' (1880) partioularly pp. 167–232. Besides these Weber and Hillebrandt have written in German scholarly works on Vedic sacrifices; Caland and Henry published a very learned, exbaustive and methodical work in French on the Agniştoma (1906). In this connection the late Dr. S. V. Ketkar's labours and researches embodied in his Marathi Encyclopædia ( vol.% and 5 ) are worthy of special consideration, since they furnish & much-needed corrective to the somewhat one-sided views of most European scholars that have written on Vedic Literature, though one is bound to differ from him in several matters. 2223 The following pages are based principally on the original texts, though here and there the works of modern scholars have been availed of. 

In his Püryamimāmsāsūtra, Jaimini submits thousands of texts to the principles of mimāmsā elaborated by him and arrives at definite conclusions on matters affecting the details of various sacrifices. An attempt has been made in these chapters on srauta to include many of his conolusions, & task, which so far as I know, has not been essayed by any modern writer on dharma or srauta up till now. 

2223. Prof. Dumont's 'L'Agnihotra' (1939) came into my hande when these pages were passing through the press. Hillebrandt's Das Altindische Neu-und Vollmondsopfer' (Jena, 1879) and 'Ritual.. Litteratur Vedisobo Opfer und Zauber' (1897, in the Enoyolopædia of Indo-Aryan Philology and Antiquities ) deservedly enjoy a high ropatation among works on srauta sacrifioos.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Ch. XXIX 

The fundamental conceptions of Yajña ( sacrifice ) go back to Indo-European 8844 antiquities though the traces are rather faint. But it is quite clear that the cult of the sacrifice had been much developed in the Indo-Iranian period. There is a very striking resemblance between the Vedic Agniştoma and the Homa ceremony of the Parsis (vide Haug's Ait. Br. vol. I, Introduction p. 59 ff). There are numerous words indicative of the cult of the sacrifics both in the Vedio language and in the ancient Parsi religious books. For example, words like atharvan, ahuti, uktha, barbis, mantra, yajña, soma, savana, sto na, hots do also ooour in the ancient Parsi religious scriptures. *225 Though Vedic sacrifices are now very rarely performed (except a few simple ones like the Darsa-pürnamisa and the Cāturmāsyas), they were in great vogue several centuries before the Christian era. Centuries after the advent and spread of Buddhism we learn from inscriptions and literary traditions that kings often performed the ancient solemn Vedio sacrifices and gloried in having done so. In the Harivamsa (III. 2. 39-40), in the Mālavikāgnimitra ( Act V, which speaks of Rajasüya), in the Sunga Inscription from Ayodhy: (E. I. vol. XX. p. 54 ) Senāpati Puşyamitra is said to have performed the Aśramedha (or Rājasūya). In the Hathigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX. at p. 79 ) king Khāravola is extolled as having performed the Rajasuya. In the Bilsad stone Inscription of Kumāragupta dated in the Gupta year 96 (i. e. 415-6 A. D.) it is stated that his great ancestor Samudragupta performed the Aévamedha that had gone out of yogue for a long time (oirotsannāšvamedhāhartuḥ, in Gupta Inscriptions at p. 43). In the Pardi plates (of Cedi sam. 207 i. e. 456-7 A. D.) the Trai kutaka king Dabrasena is described as the performer of Ašvamedba ( E, I. vol. X. p. 53 ). The Pikira grant of Simba varman (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 162) describes the Pallapas as the performers of many Aśramedhas and another Pallava grant (in E. I. vol. I p. % at p. 5) refers to the performance of Agaiştoma, Vajapeya and Afvamedha The Chammak plate of the Vakataka king Prayaragena II ( Gupta Inscriptions No. 55

The original worship of fire may have been individualistio as well as communal or tribal. The daily agnihotra was an individual affair; but as even simple istis like darśapürņamāsa required four priests, and Soma sacrifices required 16 priests and costly preparations, these sacrifices partook more or less of a publio or at least congregational character. It appears that as most brābmaņas were poor and could not carry on even the daily agnihotra, which pinned them down practically to one place and did not allow them to move out of the village for securing their livelihood, even agnihotra must have been comparatively rare in early times. Such Vedio sentences as 

one who has begot a son or sons and whose hair is still blaok should consecrate the Vedio fires' (quoted by Sabara on Jaimnini 1. 3. 3 and cited on p. 350 above) establish that agayadhāna was advised for brāhmaṇas when they had reached middle age ( and not before ). The daily agnihotra required the maintenance of at least two cows, besides thousands of cow-dung cakes and fuel-sticks. For the maintenance of agnihotra and the perfor mance of darsapürņamāsa (in which four priests were employed) and the Cāturmāsyas (where five priests were required) the house-bolder was required to be well-to-do. And the Soma sacrifices could be performed only by kings, nobles and the rich and by those who could collect large subscriptions. We find that kings while making grants often expressed that the object of the grants was to enable the brāhmaṇa donees to offer bali, and caru and to perform agnihotra. For example, in the Sarsavni plates of Buddharāja dated in Katacouri san. 361 I. e. 609-10 A. D. the grant is made for bali, caru and agnihotra and in the Damodarpur plates (dated 413-44 and 447-48 A.D.) the grants are made for āgnihotrs and for the performance of the five daily yajñas. *227 During the centuries of Moslem domination no help from royalty could be expected and so the institution of Vedio sacrifices languished.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Oh. XXIX 

on actual plan of the follow of Vedio BE 

Vedio sacrifices have been performed only rarely. But, since many of the grhya ceremonies as set forth in the gļhya sutras closely imitate the procedure of the Vedio fire cult and Vedio sacrifices formed the first and foremost manifestation of the sentiments of faith and worship in India, a work dealing with Dharmaśāstra cannot be said to have dealt with its subject completely and adequately if the treatinent of Vedic sacrifices were left out altogether, the following bare outline is presented here, the more so as sacrifices were the first dharmas according to Rg. X. 90.16. 

The Srauta-sūtras contain a very detailed, meticulously accurate and vivid description of the several sacrifices that were performed in ancient times. These works were manuals compiled for the practical purpose of giving directions to those who engaged in such sacrifices. They are based on ancient Brāhmaṇa texts, which they quote at every step, many individual sūtras being couched in the very language of the Brāhmaṇas, and on aotual practice and only bring together what was in vogue. The object of the following pages is not to present a thorough and detailed treatment of Vedio sacrifices, but only to indioate what the cult of the Vedio sacrifice was like and to furnish a brief description of some prominent sacri fices. The treatment is mainly based on the Srautasūtras of ĀśV., Ap., Kāt, Baud., Satyāşādha with occasional references to the Sambitās and Brāhmanas. The several divergences among the sūtras, the paddhatis and modern practice are not generally dwelt upon for the sake of saving space. One very useful work is a compilation called . Srautapadārthanirvacana, by Nageshwar Shastri published in the Benares Sanskrit series, though one of its drawbaoks is that it gives no references to any texts. The Mimāṁsā-vidyalaya at Poona bas prepared sets of all the utensils required in sacrifices and has published an album containing piotures of utensils and maps of various altars required in Vedio sacrifices. The Cāturmāsyas, the Pasubandha, the Jyotiştoma have been described in some detail, the darśapūrņamāsa has been dealt with in extenso, and other sacrifices have been only briefly touched upon in this work. 

We find that even in the remotest ages when the hymns of the Rgveda Samhitā were composed and compiled, the main features of the sacrificial system had been evolved. That there were three fires appears clear from Rg. II. 36. 4 ( where Agni is asked to sit down in three places ), I. 15. 4, V. 11. 2 ("men 

Ch XXIX) 

Śraula Sacrifices-in the Rgveda

kindle Agoi in three places'). The Garhapatya fire is exprefs ly named in Rg. I. 15. 12. The three savanus ( i. 8. pressings of Soma in the morning, mid-day and evening) are mentioned in Rg. III. 28.1 (prātah-sāva), III. 28. 4 (mādhyandina savana ), III. 28.5 (istiya savans ), III. 52. 5-6 and in IV. 12. 1 ( where it is said that the sacrifice gives food to Agni three times on all days ), IV. 33. 11. It may be afirmed that the sixteen priesta2228 required in Soma sacrifices were probably well-known to the composers of the Rgveda hymns; Rg. I. 162.5 mentions hots, adhvaryu, agnimindha (agnit or āgnidhra), grāvagrabha (grāvastut), samstā (praśāsts or maitrāvaruņa ), suvipra (brabma?); Rg. 11. 1. % refers to hotr., potr., neşir, agnit, praśāstr (maitrāvaruņa ), adhvaryu, brahma; Rg. 11.36 speaks of hotf, potr (v. %), āgnidbra (v.4), brābmaņa ( brābmaņāc chamsin ) and praśāstr ( v. 6). In Rg. II. 43. 2 we have udgātā. In Rg. III. 10.4, IX, 10.7, X. 35. 10, X. 61. 1 seven hotrs are referred to and in Rg. II. 5. 2 the potr priest is spoken of as the 8th. The word ' purohita' occurs very frequently ( Rg. I. 1. 1, I. 44.10 and 12, III. 2.8, IX. 66. 20, X. 98. 7). The Rgveda names Atirātra (VII. 103, 7), Trikadruka (II. 22. 1, VIII. 13. 18, VIII. 92. 21, X. 14. 16 ). The yüpa ( the post to which the sacrificial animal was tied) and its top called caşāla are

In Agnihotra only adhvaryu is required, in the Agoyadheya, Darba pūryamasa and other iptis four priests are required viz. adhvaryu, agaidhra, botr and brahman ; in the Cüturm dayas five are required viz., the four (of darda purga masa ) and the pratipasthat; in the animal sacrificos a sixth is addod viz., tho maitriyaruga, la Soma sacrifices all sixteen aro required. In the oturmasya oallod sakamedba the Aguidhra is addressed as brahmaputra (vide Asv. Śr. II. 18. 12 ) and this may explain Rg. II. 43.2 (cited on p. 27 above) where the word 'brahmaputra' occurs).

mentioned in Rg. I. 162. 6. Rg. III. 8 is full of the praise of the yūpe. The person who killed the animal sacrificed ( the samitr ) is mentioned in Rg. 162. 10 and V. 43. 4. The Gharma (the pot of boiled milk required in the Pravargya rite or perhaps the Dadhigharma in the mādbyandina savana ) is mentioned in Rg. III. 53. 14, V. 30. 15, V. 43. 7. It was believed that the animal offered in a sacrifice went to heaven.4929 Fire for sacrifice was produced by attrition from two arañis (vide Rg. III. 29. 1-3, V. 9.3, VI. 48. 5). The darvi ( Rg. V. 6,9), sruo (Rg. IV. 12. 1, VI. 11.5), juhū ( Rg. X. 21. 3 ) are mentioned in the Rg. Numerous verses in praise of gifts occur in the Rg, which have been pointed out above ( pp. 837-839 ). In Rg. III. 53. 3 there is a clear reference to the call or permis sion sought by the hot; (ahāva ) and the response of the adhvaryu (pratigara ).2230 Rg. X. 114. 5 speaks of the twelve grahas ( cups) of Soma. In Rg. I. 28. 1-2 reference is made to the broad-bottomed stone (grāvan) used for beating Soma stalks, the mortar in which Soma is pounded and the adhişayapa (pressing) board. In Rg. I. 20. 6, I. 110. 3, I. 161. 1 and VIII. 82. 7 the wooden vessel called 'camasa ' used for drinking Soma is spoken of. The word 'avabhrtha' (concluding bath in a Soma sacrifice ) occurs in Rg. VIII. 93. 23. In Rg. X. 51. 8-9 the words prayāją and anugāja occur. The ten Apri hymns of the Rgveda indicate that at the time of their composi. tion the animal sacrifice had already some of the principal features that are seen in the srauta sūtras. 

Some of the general rules applicable in all srauta rites may be stated once for all. Vide Asy, śr. I. 1. 8-22. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the sacrificer should always face the north, should sit down cross-legged, and the sacrificial mate. rials (like kusa grass &o.) should have their ends pointed to. wards the east. The sacred thread should be worn in all rites in the upavita form, except where the nivita or pradināyita form is expressly ordained; wherever a limb (anga) is mentioned or no particular limb is mentioned, it is the right limb (hand, foot, finger) that is meant; wherever the word 'dadati '(he

gives ) is used the yajamāna (the sacrificer) is the agent of the action, Kāt. sr. I. 10. 12 states that the yajamāna is the actual performer in the case of gifts or repeating texts where the word 'vācayati' occurs in the sūtras or in anvā-rambhana, or in choosing & boon, in the case of observances (such as truthfulness ), and in the case of measures (i. e. when it is said that a thing should be of the height of a man, it is the sacri. fioer's height that is meant). When any rite is prescribed without expressly stating the performer, it is the hot; who does it and in the case of prüyaścittas wherever the words juhoti' and 'japati' occur the brahma priest is the agent to do those latter acts. When the first pada of a řk is mentioned for being employed in any rite the whole verse is intended to be recited; when the first words of a hymn are mentioned for being employed in a rite, but the words quoted in the sutra do not amount to & pāda, the whole hymn is to be repeated in that rite; wherever more than the first pāda of a verse is mentioned, it is intended that three verses are to be recited ( that verse and the two following). Japa, āmantrana, abhimantraña, &pyāyana, upasthāna and mantras that indicate the rite that is being performed are to be recited in a low voice (upāmśu ). A special rule (apavāda or visegavidhi ) is stronger than a general rule (prasanga). 

Other general propositions are: Yaga ( sacrifice) is con. stituted by dravya (material ), devala ( deity) and tyaga and yāga means abandonment of dravya intending it for a deity; homa means the offering of dravya in fire intending it for a deity. Yajatis ( sacrificial rites ) for which no express reward is declared 2231 by the texts are the anga (subordinate part) of the principal yāga. Mantras are of four categories viz. pk, yajus, soman and nigada; 2238 pks are metrical; & yajus has no restriction as to metre, but it is a complete sentence (Kat. $r. I. 3.2); a sāman is sung; nigadas are praişas i. e. words addressed to another calling upon the latter to do a certain thing e. 8. 'prokşanır-āsādaya, sruoaḥ sammțddhi' ( Kāt. Sr.

II. 6. 34). They are yajus, but they are distinguished from ordinary yajus formulæ by the fact that nigadas are uttered loudly, whilo ordinarily a yajus is recited in a low voice. Jaimini in II. 1. 38-45 brings out this distinction between ordinary yajus and nigada. Vide Jaimini II. 1, 35-37 for the definitions of rk, saman and yajus. Verses from the Rg. and Sāmayeda are recited loudly, all yajus are muttered in a low voice except aśruta ( i. e. passages like 'āśrāvaya'), pratyā. bruta ( the response 'astu grauşat'), pravara-mantra ( agnir dovo hota &o., set out in note 1139 above), sampada (requests and permissions as in 'brahman, shall I sprinkle with water. and 'yes, do sprinkle'), sam-praisa (summons to do something as prokşapir-isādaya ). Loudness is of three kinds, high pitched, middle-pitched and low-pitohed. The Sāmidheni verses are to be recited in a middle pitch, all mantras in the rites from anvādbāna upto ājyabhāga in Jyotistoms and prātaḥ-savana are to be recited in a low pitch, while in all rites in darsapür. namāsa the mantras are to be recited in a low pitch from ajya bhāga to sviştakrt. The rest of the mantras in darśapürna māsa after sviştakrt and in Trtiya Savana are to be recited in high pitch. Mantras that are being recited at the time of doing anything (and produce the idea ' I sball do it') are to be recited first and then the act is to be begun (e. g. cutting is to be done immediately on reciting ' işe tvā'). Vide Jaimini XII. 3. 25. An act is to be begun to be performed the moment the reciting of a mantra accompanying it is finished (Kat. I. 3. 5-7). Utkara is the spot where the dust of the Vedi is swept up and pranitā is water kept in & vessel to the north of the havaniya after repeating a mantra over it. The sacrif cial ground where the fires are maintained is called vihāra (Sabara on Jaimini XII. 2, 1 says 'vihāra iti garbapatyadira gnistretocyato vibaranāt'). The way for going to or coming from the vihāra is between the praņlta (water) and utkara in the case of iştis ( i. e. to the east of utkara and to the west of pranita ) and between the utkara and the cātvala pit in other cases (Ap. sr. I. 1. 4-6, Kat. sr. I. 3. 42-43). This path for going to the vibāra is called Wrtha. The çatvala is a pit which is required only in soma and animal sacrifices. Many sacrificial utensils are required out of which the gruva ( which may be called the dipping spoon) is made of khadira wood and is ono gratni in length and has a moutb (or bowl) that is rounded and is as wide as the front joint of the thumb. The stuc (offering ladle) is one cubit in length, has a bowl at one end of the shape and

Sruo is of three kinds: juhū ( ladle) made of palāša, upabhrt of asvattha and the dhruv& is made of vikankata wood and all other sacrificial utensils are made of vikankata, but those that are not directly conneoted with homa are made of varana tree; the sword called sphya is made of khadira ( Kāt. I. 3. 31-39). The principal yajñapātras (or yajñāyudhas as they are often called) are given in the note below.a233

The pairs are : sphya (the wooden sword) and kepala, then the sūrpa (made of split bamboo or of nada grass or of reed) and agnibotra-havani and so on. The com. on Kāt. II. 3. 8 says that whatever patras may be required in the several rites are to be got ready and be enumerates many such pātras. The juba, upabbit and dhruva symbolically represent respectively the right arm, the left arm and the trunk of yajia. Vide Sat, Br. 1. 3. 2. 2. Tho number of kapalas varies according to the rite that is performed and the stra of the performor. Besides the ten princi. pal ones opumerated above there are others that are required viz.

Vide oom. on Kot, I. 3. 36 for the namos and sizes of all these and other utensils and for directions on the materials of which they are to be made. When the person who bas maintained the sacred fires dies he is cremated with his Vedio fires and his wooden sacrificial Vessels 'आहितामिममिभिर्दधन्ति पक्षपात्रैश्च' quoted by Sabara on Jaimini XI. 3. 84. Vide Sat. Br. XII. 3. 5. 2. This is what is oalled for free of the utensils. This means that the uton. sils are placed on the several limbs of his corpse (e. g. the jahu in the right hand) and his body and they are burnt together. That is the final disposal of the yajña pātras. Jaimini (XI. 3. 43-44) declaros that though the yajāapatras are set out in tho kruti? toxts when speaking about paarnamdai ieti, still they are to be made roady at agny d boya and are to bo kopt throughout since that date till the sacrificer's death and that their cremation with the sacrifoor's body is their @pal disposal (pratipatti).

to the contrary) by the gārbapatya fire, but the cooking of a havis may be done on either gārbapatya or āhavaniya according to one's sutra. When the material is not specified, homa is performed with clarified butter and all homas are done in the āhavaniya when there is no express text and the juhū ladle is to be employed in offering home (Kat I. 8. 44-45 ). Those parts that are to be done with Rg. mantras are to be done by the hots priest (unless there be a special direction or reason to the contrary ), the adhvaryu does what is to be done with Yajurveda, the udgātp with Sama veda and the brahmā priests with all the three Vedas *934 (vide Ait. Br. 25.8). Brāhmaṇas alone are to be priests (Jai. X.II. 4. 42-47). The sacrificer's wife is seated south-west of the gārhapatya fire and her face is turned towards the north-east (Kat. II. 7. 1). At the beginning of an işti or other rite five operations (called bhūsamskāra) are to be performed on the mound (khara) of the abavaniya and also on that of the dakşiņā fire viz. parisamūhana ( sweeping round with wet hand) thrice from the east to the north, smearing thrice with cowdung ( gomaya-upalepana), drawing with the wooden sword ( sphya ) three lines from south to north but towards the east (i. e. the last is to be in the east) or from cast to west but towards the north, to remove the dust from those lines with the thumb and the ring finger, and sprinkling thrice with water (abhyukşaņa). 

Agnyādheya 4235 Gaut. (VIII. 20-21 ) enumerates seven haviryajñas and seven somasaisthus. Agnyadheya is the first of the seren haviryajñas. Agoyadheya is the same ag agnyādhāns. It is an işti, which word means a sacrifice performed by a saorificer and his wife.with the help of four priests' (vide above note 2228). The details of a model işçi are given later on under darbapūrņamāga. Agnyādheya ocoupies two days, the first day called upavasatha being taken up by preliminary matters and the 2nd with performance of the main rites. There are two times for the performance of agnyadbeya. It may be done on one of the seven naksatras, viz, Kșttika, Rohini, Mrgasirea, Purvā Phalguni, Uttarā Pbalgunl, Visakha, Uttara Bhadrapada, Ap. adds other nakşatras viz.

appropriate nakşatras when the sacrificer desires certain rosulta (V. 3. 3-14). According to Sat. Br. II. 1. 2. 17 and Ap. V. 3. 13 a ksatriya should consecrato sacred fires on the Citrā nakşatra. Or agnyādheýa may be done on a parva day in spring by & brābmaņa, in summer, in the rainy season and autumn respec tively by & kşatriya, a vaisya and an upakruşta ( for the latter vide p. 74 above ). But even when choosing the season, one must have regard to the seven nakşatras specified above. Āp. states that the setting up of the fires may take place on Full moon or New moon day and that hemanta or sarad is the proper season for a vaisya, the rainy season for a rathakāra ( carpenter) or all the varnas may first consecrate the fires in sisira (Ap. V. 3. 17-20). Vide Jai. II. 3-4 about the meaning of the Vedio passage'a brāhmaṇa should set up fires in spring' (Tai. Br. I.1.2). The Sat. Br. (III. 1. 2. 19 ) appears to condemn the Betting up of fires by reliance on nakşatras and recommends (XI. 1.1.7) that agnyadhana should be performed on the New moon of Vaisakha on which there is Rohini nakgatra. In case of difficulty one may perform agnyādheya in any season and if one has resolved upon performing a soma sacrifice one need not stop to consider the season or nakgatra. The man who wants to perform agnyādheya must not be too young nor too old ( vide p. 979 above). 

Agnyadheya means the placing of burning coals for the generation of the gārbapatya and other fires at a partioular time and place by a partioular person to the accompaniment of certain mantras. 3236 Agnyādheya comprehends the several acts from the bringing of the aranis (two wooden logs ) to the offeriog of pürnāhuti. When this last takes place the person who engages in the rites attains the position of an abitāgni (one who has oonsecrated the sacred Vedio fires). Agnyadhana is meant for all sacrificial rites and not merely for enabling & man to perform darsapürnamāseşti (Jai. III. 6. 14-15, XI. 3. 2). The sacrificer should bring home through the adhvaryu priest two arapls from an advattha tree that grows inside a sami tree with the mantra 'yo aśvatthaḥ śami-garbhaḥ' ( Ašv. II. 1. 17). The branoh to be out must be one on the east or north side of the tree and its foliage must be turned towards the east or north. When the branch falls on the ground the portion of it that

Acoording to Baud, each arapi is 16 angulas long, twelve in breadth and 4 in height, while according to Kat. ( as quoted in com. on Ap.) it is 24 angulas long. According to Ap. (V. 1. 3) the asvattha may not be growing inside a sami tree, The two aranis are invoked ( abbimantrana) with the formula "asvatthād...dhehi āyur-yajamāne' ( Tai. Br. I. 2. 1.) and the adhvaryu brings together on the altar ( vedi) seven items that are earthy and seven items that are of wood or five of each or 8 earthy items (if those of wood are seven). The eight earthy items are : sand, saltish earth, the earth from a hole infested by mice, the earth from an ant-bill, the olay (süda) from the bottom of a reservior of water that never dries up, earth that is struck by wild boars, pebbles, gold (Ap. V. 1. 4 ff.) with mantras appropriate*837 to each. The seven wooden items are : (parts of ) asvattha, udumbara, parņa (palāśa ), sami, vikana kata, a tree struok by lightning (or by wind or cold) and a lotus-leaf. Baud. II. 12 enumerates these somewhat differently. The sacrificer prepares a raised place for worship (devayajana) 1988 

2237. In Tai. Br. I. 2. 1 occur most of the mantras roferred to by Ap. under agry&dheya,

I. 2. 1), and constructs a shed having the end of the principal bamboo or ridge turned northwards or eastwards. Beneath the middle of the ridge of the hut towards one end is the place (ayatana) meant for the gārbapatya fire; the place of the ahavaniya fire is to the east of the gārhapatya at a distance of eight prakramas\#239 for a brāhmana, eleven and twelve for a kşatriya and vaibya respectively or all may have it 24 steps ( pada ) or at a distance found by the eye to approximate to the distances stated (without actual measurement). The place for the dakşiņāgai is near the gārbapatya to the south-east after a third of the distance between the gārbapatya and abavaniya. There are to be separate sheds for the āhavaniya fire and the gārbapatya in elaborate sacrifices but for the ordinary sacrifices like darsapürņamāsa one shed only is usually constructed which houses all the three fires. It is laid down that only Vedic rites are to be performed with the three fres, and that they were not to be used for ordinary cooking or for secular purposes (vide Jaimini XII, 2.1-7). The sabhya fire is to be established in front of the āhavaniya in the gambling hall and the āvasathya fire is in a shed ( for guests ) to the east of the sabbya.9340 

The sacrificer gets the hair on the head and face shaved, pares his nails and then bathes; the wife also does the same except shaving the hair on the head. The husband and wife are to establish fires after wearing two silken garments each, which are to be given up to the adlivaryu at the time of distri. buting dakşinā (after the rite of agayādheya is finished). The sacrificer should perform the sankalpa (words indicating resolve) of performing agnyādheya and choose his priests (rtvig-Varana)

If he takes up the whole of the aupāgana fire, then he should take on two leaves of udumbara & oske of barley flour and another of rice and should throw on the place of the brāhmaudanika fire the barley cake to the west and the rice cake to the east and then establish the fire thereon. The adhvaryu puts apart at night to the west of the brāhmaudanika fira on the red bide of a bull having the neck part to the east and the hair outside or on a bamboo utensil four dishfuls of rice3242 grains after repeating the mantra

From the cooked food (the brahmaudana ) he takes some in & spoon ( daryl) and offers it into (the brahmaudanika) fire with the mantra 'pr& vedhase kavaye' (Rg. V. 15.1 - Tal. Br. I. 2.1). He should say this is for Brahman; not mine.' Having put the cooked food separately into four dishes and pouring plenty of ghee over it, the sacrificer draws the plates over the ground towards the priests without letting them go and brings them near the four priests who are descendants of illustrious sages. The remaining portion of the brahmaudana

is drawn out of the pots, the rest of the clarified butter is poured over it and three samidhs of a citriya 2343 aśvattha that are wet ( not dry), that are a span in length and have on them their leaves and fruits are dipped therein and turned about therein with a mantra and then they are put on the fire to the accom paniment of three gāyatris ( addressed to Agni) for brāhmaṇas, three Triştubhs for ksatriyas and three Jagatis for vaisyas (the verses are set out in Ap. V. 6.3). 

When the samidhs are offered into fire he ( sacrificer) gives three heifers to the adhvaryu and a similar number to each of the brābmaņas who eat the brahmaudana. This brahmaudana along with the gifts of heifers and offering of samidhs may be performed daily for one year before the date of agnyādbāna. These samidhs must be offered by everyone intending to set up the three sacred fires 12 days, three daye, two days or & day before the day of agnyādheya. He (sacrificer) has to keep certain observances viz. be does not partake of flesh, does not cobabit, others do not take away fire from his house; bo subsists (for three days) only on milk or on boiled rice, he has to speak the truth and to avoid sleeping on a cot. If for some reason the sacrificer is unable to perform agnyādheya in a year (or 12 days &c.) from the time be offered brahmaudans he should again cook brahmaudana, offer the samidhs and then should perform agnyadhana when he can do 80.2244 On the night previous to the day of øgnyadhāna the adhvaryu (acoording to Bharadvāja. all the priests ) keeps certain observanoes viz. he does not eat flesh nor does he approach his wife. 

On that night a goat having dark spots on its skin is tied towards the north of the place for the gārhapatya fire with a mantra 'praja' agne &o.'. The yajamāna observes & vow of silence on that night and people keep him awake that night by playing upon a lute and a flute (but there is an option vil be may not keep awake nor observe silence). The sacrificer remains awake the whole of that night placing pieces of wood on the brahmaudanika fire with the verge 'salkair-agnim &c. (but if he does not keep awake he heaps on the fire logs of wood

at one time and then goes to sleep).1245 At day-break the adhvaryu heats the two aranis against that fire with two verses * jātavedo bhuvanasya &c.' and 'ayam te yonir-stviyaḥ' (both in Tal. Br. I. 2.1). Then the brāhmaudanika fire is extin guished, the two arañis are invoked with the verse 'agni rakṣāmsi' and the yajamāpa keeps waiting for the arañis that are brought with the verse 'mabi višpatnl.' The adhvaryu hands over the arañis to the sacrificer with the verge dohyā ca te', who receives them with a verse and immediately invokes them with two verses. Both (adhvaryu and yajamana) repeat in a low voice the formula 'mayi gpbņāmyagre &o.'. The adhvaryu arranges the place for the gārhapatya with the verse *apeta vita' and sprinkles it with water with 'sam no devir.' He does the same for the places (āyatanas) of the dakşiņa fire ( to the south-east) and of āhavaniya, sabhya and avagathya fires. Even since ancient times there have been agnihotrins who did not get up the sabhya and āvasathya fires. Half of the sand (that has already been brought among the sambhāras ) is divided into two parts, one (i. o. of the whole heap ) being scattered over the place of the gārhapatya and the other ( 1 ) over the place of the dakşiņāgni. The other half of the sand beap is divided into three parts each of which is soattered in the places of the other three, dhavaniya, gabhya and Avasathya (but if no sabhya nor dvasathya is to be kept then the half is entirely scattered over the ahavaniya place ). In the same way the other eartby materials are placed over the places of the fires with appropriate mantras. After he places the lime stones or pebbles on the various places he brings to his mind his enemy. Then he spreads the various materials on the fire places and after mixing together the materials of wood to the accompaniment of two mantras he scatters them just as he scattered the sand (after dividing them as stated above). He casts to the north over the materials & piece of gold on the place of the gārhapatya 5246 ānd invokes it with a mantra and assigns at a distance a piece of silver for bis enemy or throws it into water if he has no enemy. The same process of casting & golden piece) is followed as to the places of the other fires. He removes the ashes of the brahmaudanika fire (that

When the first rays of the sun spread in the sky (i. e, before the sun's diso is seen, but the eastern horizon is lit up by rays ) he places the upper araṇi on the lower one to the accompaniment of the 'daśa-hotr *2247 formulae. While generation of fire by attrition is proceeding a white or red horge from whose oyes no water drops ( i. e, who is not blear-oyed) and wliose knee is dark (or any horse with full testicles ) is kept present and a sāman of Sakti Sanksti is sung; when smoke rises a sāman of Gathina Kausika is sung and also the verse 'aranyor-nibito (Rg. III. 29. 2). 

He (the adhvaryu ) invokes the fire with the mantra 'upd Varoha jātavedaḥ '(Tai. Br. II. 5. 8 ) the moment it is produced. Then the adhvaryu makes the sacrifioer recite the catur-hots ( mantras ) 2948 and invokes the fire when kindled with the mantra' ajannagniņ'. When the fire is produced the yajamāna bestows on the adhvaryu the most desirable fee (i, e, & cow), which he accepts with a mantra. After the fire is produced, the yajamāna breathes over it with the formula 'prajāpatista' (Tai. S. IV, 2.9.1). The adhvaryu holds over the fire his folded bands turned downwards with a verse, makes it blaze forth by means of fuel-sticks with the words 'samrādasi' (Tai. S. IV. 3. 6. 2), holds it in his folded hands turned upwards, site down on a seat and while the Rathantara and Yajñāyajñiya sāmans are being chanted, he establishes the gārbapatya fire on the sambhāras ( the earthy and wooden materials scattered as above ) by repeating certain mantras according as the sacrificer

has a certain gotra 1949 (or pravara ) and the first vyāhrti ( i. e. bhaḥ ) or the first two vyabftis (bhūh, bhuvaḥ ), the first two Sarparājni formulæ and the first of the Gharmasiras texts. The formula for establishing the garhapatya according to the gotra is stated in note 2249. Wben establishing the gārhapatya on the sambhāras the adhvaryu further repeats certain mantras ( given In Ap. Śr. V.12. 2) and then the yajamana invokes the fires with the mantra 'sugārbapatyo'(Tai. Br. I. 2. 1) and the adhvaryu makes the yajamāna repeat the Gharmaširas formula. The adhvaryu strews darbhas round the gā-hapatya ( i. e. he does paristarana ). 

The procedure for establishing the ahavaniya is to be so arranged that the fire is aotually established when half of the sun's diso rises above the eastern horizon. The adhvaryu lights fuel-sticks on the gārbapatya for being carried forward and he takes in & vessel the sand on which fire would be supported to the accompaniment of four verses. Then while carrying the fire, he raises & little the kindled bundle of fuel-sticks and holds the fire on the eand. Then the adhvaryu makes the yaja. māna repeat in the right ear of the horse the Agnitanu formula (set out in Ap. Sr. V. 13. 7), holds the fire for some time and then lays it down in the place for the āhavaniya,

The Agnidhra priest then brings domestio fire or produces fire by attrition, sits down with his knees raised up, and establi shes the dakşiņāgni, while the Yajñāyajñiya sāman is being chanted and follows the procedure of repeating formula according to the gotra ( as above ) and repeats the 2nd vyāhrti (bhuvab), the three Sarparājai formulæ and the 2nd Gharma siras ( viz. the verse 'vātaḥ ... ... ... paca'). After repeating several other formule (as in Ap. Sr. V. 13.8) he sets down dakşiņa fire on the sambhūras. 

The fire brought for establishing 2250 dakşiņa fire may be fetched from the house of a brāhmana, 8 kşatriya, a vaisya or a gūdra who is extremely prosperous like an asura (if the sacri ficer desires prosperity ), but he should thereafter never eat at that man's house; or ( according to Baud. Sr. II, 17) it may be brought from the gārhapatya fire or according to Aśv, from the house of a vaisya or of any rich man or it may be produced by attrition, 

When the abavaniya fire is being taken (in a vessel ) from the gārhapatya the Vāmadevya is chanted and they proceed to wards the east preceded by the horse,2257 repeating three mantras. To the south of the vihāra the brahmā priest makes a chariot or a chariot wheel move up till three revolutions of the wheel take place (six times for an enemy). A third part of the distance between the gārhapatya and the place for Abavaniya ) the fire is carried at the height of the knee, the 2nd third at the height of the navel, the last third at the height of the mouth, No one is to come between the sun and the fire. He takes the fire with both his hands stretched to the right. In the middle of the distance the yajamana gives a gift to the priest. In the middle of the distance the adhvaryu puts down a piece of gold and then crosses over it with the mantra' nākosi." The adhvaryu makes the horse that faces the east go over the sam. bhāras to their north with its right hoof placed in such & way that the live coals of the fire when established would fall on the foot-print made by the horse and making the horse turn to its right he again makes the horse go over the sambhāras with a formula 'yadakrandaḥ' (Rg. I. 163. 1). The horse is held

facing the west to the east of the place for the abavanlye. The horse must be young and according to Paingyayani Brāhmana a young bull may do (if a horse is not available). According to the Bahvroa Brahmana the (abavenlya) fire should be established on the footmark of an animal called Kamandalu or of a goat (accord ing to Vajasaneyaka). Then the sacrificer mutters suspicious formula 8158 and sends to his enemy (a curse ) with the formula * go to him, O fire, with thy terrible forms.' Having invoked the fire with the verse Yad-idam divah' ( Tai, Br. I. 2. 1) he turning his face to the west and standing to the east establishes the abavaniya fire. The āhavaniya is laid down upon the sambhāras when the Bphat Sāman, the Syaita, Vāravantiya and Yajñāyajõlya are being chanted, and the procedure of repeating consecrating mantras according to gotra is being followed, when all the vyābftis, all the Sarpa-rājñi mantras, the third Gharma siras formula and certain other verses are recited.3252 The sacrificer Invokes the abavaniya when it is being established with the formula 'ānase &o.'( which occurs in Tal. Br. I. 1.7 ) and he follows the priest ( whether adhvaryu or āgnidhra ) in repeating the various vyāhrtis, the Sarparājai verses and the Gharmaśiras formula. The fire when established should be propitiated with clarified butter and plants (i. e. fuel-sticks ) after repeating certain formulæ (set out in Ap. V. 16. 4). The sāmans are sung by the brahmā priest in Agnyādheya (and there is no udgāti priest ), 9254 

The sabhya and āvasathya fires are established with domestio fire or fire produced by attrition or with fire taken from the

dhavaniya, according to the mode of establishment dependent on the gotra as stated above. He puts on each fire three gamidhs of the asvattha tree with three verses (Rg. IX, 66, 19, 21, 20 ) and three samidhs of gaml smeared with ghee after repeating certain mantras (Rg. IV. 58. 1-3). Or these samidhs may be offered in the dhavaniya (if sabhya and a vasathya are not kept up). 

Then he offers a pūrpāhuti,8265 the sacrifioer gives gifts. mutters certain auspicious formulæ, waits in worship upon the five (or three ) fires. Then if the yajamāna is & keatriya dice play takes place. The gifts given to all the four priests are clotb, a cow and bull, and a new chariot, while a goat, pürna pātra and & pillow of several coloured threads are given to the āgnidbra, & horse to brahmā, & bull to adhvaryu, and a dhenu to the hotr. There are larger gifts specified according to the sacrificer's ability. 

Kāt. (IV. 10. 16 ) ordains that after establishing the Vedio fires the yajamāna should observe complete celibacy for 12 nights, 6 nights or at least three nights, should sleep near the fires on the ground (and not on a cot), should offer hona of milk to the fires. Baud. II. 20 prescribes further observances for twelve days. 

Punarādheya: When within a year after a man sets up the Vedio fires he suffers from severe illness ( such as dropsy ) or suffers loss of wealth or his son dies or his near relatives are harassed or made captive by his enemies or he becomes cripple in a limb, or if he is desirous of prosperity or fame he again sets up the fires. The procedure is essentially the same as for agoyadheya with a few differences e. g. fires are fed with kusa 

2255. The com. on Kāt, IV. 10. 5 explains gorgt sura: quista:. The procedure ordinarily applying to all abutis of clarifiod butter is: Tbe adhvaryu puts butter into the butter-pot, which is placed on the garba patya fire to melt. Having wiped the sruva (dipp jog spoon) and juhu (offering spoon) with darbb. grass and having taken the butter pot off the fire be dips two darbha blados used 48 strainers (pavitra ) into the beated butter and fills the jabū with the Bruva. Then he takes a samidh, walks over to the north side of the abayaniya, strews darbha grasa round it and puts the samidb on that firo, Then be sits down with bent right knoo, pours the butter in the juhū on to the fire with the word syahe and the sacrificer utters tho formula bagaaya idan'na mama'. This holda good in agayadheya and agaibotra, but in many other rites the principal (pradhana) offerings are offered wbile the priest is standing.998

grass and not with wood nor with fuel-sticks, the two ājyabha gas are for agni alone ( while in the model sacrifice they are for Agni and Soma ), the punarādheya is performed in the rainy season and at mid-day. Other differences and details are passed over. 9956 Jai.( VI. 4. 26-27 ) states that punaradheya is a prāyascitta only if both the fires ( gārbapatya and abavenlya) have been extinguished or discontinued and (in X. 3. 30-33) that when punaradheya is resorted to for some desired object, the fees that are prescribed in agnyadhāna are not the fees to be given, but other dakšiņā is given, 

Agnihotra According to Gau. VIII. 20 there are seven forms of haviryajñas of which agnihotra is the second. From the evening of the day of agnyādheya the house-holder has to perform agnihotra 2257 ( burnt offering of cow's milk &o.) twice daily in the evening and morning to the end of his life or till he becomes a samnyāsin, or as the Sat. Br. ( XII. 4. 1.1) says Those who offer agnihotra indeed enter upon a long sacrificial session; agnihotra indeed is & sattra that ends with old age or death, since he becomes free from it only by old age or death.' Satyāşadba prescribes (III. 1 ) that from the time of setting up the three srauta fires, agnihotra and darśapürna māsa are obligatory on all members of the twice-born classes and he holds that the nişāds and rathakāra also are bound to perform them, though other sūtrakāras are opposed to this, Vide pp. 45–47 above. Jal. (VI. 3.1-7 and 8-10 ) holds that agni. hotra being obligatory, it may be undertaken even by him who is not able to perform every detail of it in its entirety, but that a kāmya rite should be undertaken only by him who is able to carry out every detail. Vide also Jai. II. 4, 1-7 where 'gāvaj jivam-agnihotram juhoti' is explained as laying down a

charaoteristic required of the performer. The several sutras present differing details and mantras, 3258 According to one view all the three fires are permanently maintained by the house-holder '389 ( Kāt. IV. 13.5); according to others only the gārhapatya is permanently kept (Ap. VI. 2. 13) and the dakşi. ņāgni is permanently kept only if it was set up by attrition at the time when the house-holder performed agnyādheya. The house-holder calls upon the adhvaryu to bring the āhavaniya from the garbapatya in the evening and also in the morning; this is so only if the yajamāna engages an adhvaryu in the daily agnihotra, but if the yajamāna does the daily agnihotra himself this call is unnecessary. As to the dakşiņāgni in the daily Agnihotra, Āśv. (II. 2. 1) mentions several alternatives viz., it may be brought from the house of & vaisya or from the house of any rich man or it may be produced by attrition or it may be kindled into flames if it is kept permanently. He should take burning coals from the kindled gārbapatya in & vessel and carry them to the place of the dhavaniya with the mantra 'devam tvā devebhyaḥ śriyā uddharāmi' and should repeat when carrying the burning coals towards the east the mantra' raise me up from sin that I knowingly or unknow ingly may have committed ; save me from all the sin that I may have committed in the day'( this in the evening agni. hotra, in the morning agnihotra it baing said 'sin that I committed at night'). Vide ĀŠv. II, 2.3 and 6, Ap. VI. 1. 7, Baud. III. 4. He should face the sun and place the burning coals in the ahavaniga mound with the mantra (amptāhutim &c., ja Ašv. II. 2. 4, Ap. VI. 1. 8, Baud. III. 4). In the morning agnihotra also he should face the sun and do other things stated above. Acoording to Kat. (IV. 13. 2) the evening agni. hotra is to be commenced before the sun gets and the morning one before the sun rises. Ašv, says that the homa is performed

after the sun sets. There have been two views on this point from very anoient times viz. whether agnihotra is to be performed before sunrise or after sunrise. Vide Ait. Br. 24. 4-6 and Kausitaki Br. II. 9. Ap. ( VI. 4. 7-9 ) mentions four views as to both evening or morning time for agnihotra viz, it should be the sandhi of day and night for both or it may be when the first star is seen or in the first watch of the night or in the 2nd ( for evening agnihotra ) and at dawn, or when a part of the disc of the sun just appears on the horizon or after the sun comes up. The householder performs agnihotra after finishing his sandhyā adoration. There is a difference of opinion, some holding that the homa in the grhya fire should precede the agnihotra in the Vedic fires, while others hold that it should come after the Vedio agnihotra.2860 The house-holder after performing samdhyā follows either of two modes ( Kat. IV. 13. 12 and IV 15. 2, Ap. VI. 5. 3, socording to his sakha ), goos towards the dhavaniya through the space between the places of the gārhapatya and dakşiņāgni or by a route to the south of these two fire places and having gone round the abavaniya sits down to the south in his usual place (or crosses from the western side of the abavaniya and sits down to its south ) and the wife also sits in her place (Kat. IV. 13. 13, Ap. VI. 5. 1-2). The householder then sips water (performs ācamana) with the words 'vidyudasi vidya me pāpmānam-ştat satyam-upaimi mayi sraddha' ( Ap. VI. 5. 3). The wife also sips water.2001 Then both husband and wife should observe silence till the agnihotra (morning or evening ) is gone through. A man who has no wife can perform the daily agnihotra (vide Ait. Br. 32. 8). The adhvaryu performs parisamuhana ( wiping with the wet hand from the north-east to the north ) thrice for the three fires. He strews round the

2261. The paddhati in the com. on Kat. IV. 13 remarks guara HUTC out ano o rei em: 19 yarn. This shows how gradually the wife lost all importance in Vedio sites and came to be a mere silent spectator of all the weary details that had to be gone through by the sacrifioor and the priest. Jaimini VI. 1. 17-21 stated generally that the husband and wife co-operated in porforming yajña, but in VI. 1. 24 be qualifies the gonoral statement by saying that the wife cannot do all the sotions which are to be done by the sacrificer, but only tbobo which she is expressly arkod to do in the texts.

abavaniya fire darbha grass (performs paristarapa ) in such & way that the darbhas to the east and west have their ende turned to the north and of those to the north and south turned to the east and the strewing proceeds from the east, then to the south, then to the west and then to the north. In the same way he strews darbha grass round the gārhapatya and then round the daksin. āgni. Taking water in his right hand, he sprinkles it round the dhavaniya first, beginning from the northeast and ending in the north. Then he walks towards the west pouring a conti nuous stream of water from the dhavanīya up to the gārbapatya. He then sprinkles ( performs paryuksana ) the gārbapatya from left to right and then the dakşiņāgni. Or one may sprinkle water (and this is the usual order now in the Deccan) round the gārhapatya first and then round dakşiņāgni and then pour & stream of water from the gārhapetye to the east up to the āhavaniya (Asv. II. %. 14 ). Ašv. (II. 2. 11-13 ) says that the mantra in paryukşaņa is éftasatyabhyām tvā paryukşami' and each fire is sprinkled thrice, water being taken freshly at each time and the mantra being repeated each time and that sprinkling may first be done round the dakşiņāgni, then round gārhapatya and then āhavaniya. Vide Kāt. IV. 13. 16-18, Ap. VI. 5. 4. 

The homa is performed with cow's milk for him who performs agnihotra as a sacred duty and not for any partioular reward in view, but one who desires to secure & village or plenty of food, or strength or brilliance may employ respective ly yavāgū (gruel), oooked rice, ourds or olarified butter ( Adv. II. 3. 1-2). Then an order is issued to the person engaged to milk the agnihotra cow**0% that stands to the south of the sacri. ficial ground with her face to the east or north and that has a male calf. At the time of milking the calf is to the south of the cow, and first sucks milk and then the calf is removed and the milking is done. The person to milk the cow should not be a kūdra (Kat. IV. 14,1 ), but Āp. ( VI. 3. 11-14) allows even a südra to milk the cow, while Baud. (III. 4) says that he must be a brahmana. Rules are laid down about the udders from which milk is to be drawn and about persons for whom it is to be drawn ( Sat. III. 7 based on Tai. Br, I]. 1. 8). The milking is not to be begun by pressing the udders, but by making the 

2262. Tai. Br. II. 1. 6 identifies the cow with agaibotra and II. 1.7 states that the cow's milk in its various stages belongs to various deities since the time it is in the uddor (when it is Raudra ) till after it is offered (when it is dear to Indra ).

calf suck them first ( na stanān sammāati' Ap. VI. 4. 2 based on Tai. Br, II. 1. 8). Milking is to be begun the moment the sun sets (Ap. VI. 4.5). The vessel in which the milk is to be held is of earthenware manufactured by an Arya (1. e, one who belongs to the three regenerate classes ), but without using a wheel and the vessel must have a wide mouth and straight sides and not slanting ones ( Kat. IV. 14. 1, Ap. VI. 3.7). It is called agnihotrasthall (Ap. VI. 3. 15). The adhvaryu takes from the gārhapatya fire some burning coals for boiling the milk and keeps them to the north of the gārbapatya in a separate spot. Then he goes near the cow, holds the vessel in which the cow has been milked, brings it towards the east of the Ahavaniya, sits to the west of the gārhapatya and heats the vessel on the burning coals mentioned above. He takes a darbha blade ( other than one of those that are strewn round the gārbapatya), kindles it and holding it over the milk illumi. nates the milk with its light. He then takes water in a sruya and sprinkles one drop or some drops into the boiling milk (Abv. II. 3. 3 and 5). He should then again hold a burning blade ( the same blade used before ) over the hot milk and light it up. He does this thrice and then casts away the blade to the north." There was a difference of view whether the milk to be offered should be brought to the boiling point or should only be simply hot ( vide Sat. Br. II. 3. 1. 14-16 and com, on Kāt. IV. 14, 5). Then the pot of milk is slowly lifted with three mantras and drawn down to the north from the burning coals ( Ašv. II. 3. 8, Tai. Br. II. 1. 3'vartma karoti'). Then the burning coals on whiob the milk was boiled or heated are thrown baok in the gārbapatya fire. Then & sruva and sruo both made of vikankața wood are cleaned with the hand ( to remove dust) and are heated on the gārhapatya ( or abavaniya aocording to Āp. VI. 7. 1). He then again beats the sruo and sruva on the gārbapatya, asks the yajamāna 'shall I take out milk from the pot *384 with the sruva )' and the yajamāna 2263. The Tai. Br. II. 1. 3 says stars Pa g I remet 

... motora i ... Inila I m rete NUTRITI, Tho sprinkling of water from the sruva on the milk is called pratipeka (Ap. VI. 6. 3-4). This is referred to in Tai. Br. II. 1. 3. The sruo with which agnibotra is offered is oalled agnihotra-havani, wbiob is made of vikaākata wood, is as long as one's arm or aratni (Ap. VI. 3. 6 and com. thoroon). 

2864, Ap. VI. 7.1 states that words addrossed by the adhvaryu differ Hooording to the time 'frougher TTEIHT What Taraftarroft मभिमन्योहण्यामि हाय देवेन्या पाप्मणो पजमानमिविसापमा। ओहषपामीति मातः।'

replies standing 'Yes, do take out'. Then the adhvaryu holds in his right hand the sruva ladle and in his left hand the agpihotra-havapi with its mouth turned upwards, pours out into the agnihotra-havani milk from the milk pot (already heated) with the bruva four times 3265 and keeps the srut& in the milk pot. In Ap. VI. 7. 7-8 and Aśv. II. 3, 13-14 it is said that the adhvaryu knowing the mind of the householder should draw the fullest ladle for the most favourite son of the sacrifioer or if the latter desires that the eldest son should be most pro sperous and the later ones less and less, then the first ladle is filled to the fullest; on the other hand if he wishes the youngest to be prosperous then the last ladle drawing is the fullest. Then the adhvaryu carrying a samidh of palasa wood a span in length over the rod of the sruo (inserting his finger between the two), holds the two together over the gārha patya very near its flames, carries the sruc towards the āhavaniya holding it as high as his nose; when in the midst of the distance between the gārbapatya and the āhavaniya, he brings the sruo down (to the level of his navel) and then again raising it up as high as his mouth, he reaches the ahava. niya and places the sruc and samidh on darbha blades ( on the kurca, says Baud. III. 5) to the west of the dhavanlye. He himself sits to the northwest of the abavaniya facing the east, bends his knees, holds the sruc in his left hand and with the right hand offers the samidh 2266 in the midst of the āhavaniya fire with the mantra 'rajatām tvāgnijyotişam'(according to Asv. II. 3. 15). Then he sips water with the mantra 'vidyud-asi vidya mo pāpmānam-ştāt-satyam-upaimi' (Ap. VI. 9, 3, Aby. II. 7. 16). When the samidh has caught fire and is burning brightly, he offers the first oblation (of milk) on the samidh about two finger-breadths from its root with the mantra 'om bhûr-bhuvah-svarom, agnirjyotir jyotiragnih svāha' (Vaj. S. III. 9). According to Kāt. he may optionally repeat the mantra 

2265. Milk is poured five times for those wbo are oalled pabon vattins such as householders whose gotra is Jamadagni (Ap. VI. 8. 2). According to Baudhayana (pravarddhyāya 5) Vatsas, Bidas and Arnti sepay aro pagodvattins. Ap. sets out the five mantrag repeated at osob of the five times when milk is poured with the srura. 

2266. The mantras differ according to the sutra. According to ĀP. VI. 9. 3 one gamidh or two or three may be offered and ho prororibes different mantras for the three. The Tai. Br. II. 1. 8 apholds tho offering of only ono samidh.

sajūr devena'( Vāj. 8. III. 10). According to Ap. (VI. 10.8)2208 in the evening agnihotra the mantra is agnirjyotir' &o; while in the morning agnihotra it is 'sūryo jyotir-jyotih sūryah svāba' (Vaj. S. III. 9). Then he places the sruo on the kusa blades and looks at the gārbapatya with the thought 'bestow on me cattle, Then be again takes up the sruo, makes a second offering (of milk) which is larger in measure than the first one, but this is offered silently, while he contemplates upon Prajāpati in his mind 3368. This second offering is made to the east or north of the first in such a way that the two will not come in contact. He keeps more milk in the sruc than what is taken up in making the second offering. He then raises the sruo twioe (thrice according to Āp. VI. 11. 3) in such & way that the flames of the fire turn north-wards and places the sruc on the kūrca. He scours with his hand turned down wards the spout of the ladle and then rubs his hand to which some drops of the milk stick on the north side of the kūrca (the points of the kušas that are towards the north ) with the words 'salutation to the gods' (Kāt, IV, 14.20 ) or 'to you for seouring cattle'. Ap. (VI. 10. 10 ) says that he scours in the evening the sruc (in order to remove what sticks to it) from the end of the handle down to the bowl with the man tra 'işe tyā' (Tai. $. I. 1. 1. 1.) and in the morning from the bowl to the end of the ladle with the mantra 'ürje tvā' (Tai. S. I. 1.1.1). Then while the palm is turned upwards, and while he wears his sacred thread in the prācināvita mode he places his fingers to the south of the roots of the kusa blades on the ground silently or with the mantra 'svadhi pitsbhyah' ( Kāt. IV. 14. 21 and Asy. II. 3. 21 ) or svadbā pitřbhyaḥ pilsin jinva ( Ap. VI. 11.4). Then he sips water ( but with the sacred thread in the upavita form ) with his face turned to the east. Then he walks to the place of the gārbapatya, takes a fuel-stick (samidh) in his hand while standing. He then sits down to the north west of the gārhapatya with his face turned towards the

east, bends his knee, offers the samidh in the gārbapatya fire, then drawing out in the sruva milk from the pot offers it into the fire with a mantra ( tā asya südadohagah' Rg. VIII. 69. 3, according to Ašv. II. 3. 26, or iba puştim pugtipatir......puşti. pataye svāha ', according to Kāt. IV. 14. 23). He offers a second oblation of milk by the sruva silently according to Kāt. (IV. 14. 24 ) or with the words ' bhūrbhuvaḥ svaḥ suprajah prajābhiḥ syām suviro viraiḥ suposaḥ poşaih' and with at least any three Verses addressed to Agni and with the verses "agna dyūmgi pavage' Rg. IX. 66. 19-21 ( according to Aøv. II. 3. 27–29). Then be offers one oblation of milk with the sruva ladle into the dakşiņāgni with the words 'annadāyānna-pataye svāhā' and a second one silently. He then touches water, turns northwards and with one of his fingers ( with the ring finger 'anamika' according to Kāt. IV. 14. 26 ) he takes out what remains in the sruc and licks it noiselessly without allowing it to come in contact with his teeth. He then sips water and lioke it a second time and then sips water. He then takes into another vessel or on his own palm all remnants (of milk &o.) in the sruo and licks the contents of the vessel or his palm once with his tongue. According to Ap. ( VI. 11. 5 and VI. 12. 2) and Baud. III. 6 he holds the bruc in such a way that its rod is turned east or north, and licks 3269 the sruc itself twice, fills it with water, pours down to the west the water (from the ladle ) with the mantra propitiate those who partake of leavings', sips water, and wipes the agnihotrahavani with darbha blades. Then he washes his hand, performs doamana twice, goes near the āhavaniya, sits down, fills the sruo with water and spills the water from the ladle to the north of the āhavaniya with the words "devān jinva; ' he repeats the same process again and wearing the sacred thread in the prācināvita form and turning to the south he pours water to the south of the ahavaniya for the pitrs with the words' pitgn jinva'. He then repeats the same process as for gods and sprinkles water upwards in the north-east a third time with the words 'sapta-rain jinva'. He fills the srud a fourth time, removes the darbhas from the place (kūrca sthāna )where they were placed to the west of the ahavaniya,

pours down water on that place thrice, so as to end the stream in the east or north. He then heats the sruo and sruva on the abavaniya fire together and keeps them on the antarvedi or hands them over to an attendant. He then offers three samidhs to each of the three fires in the order in which he performed paryukşana ( i.e. in the order āhavaniya, gārhapatya, dakşipāgai, or gārbapatya, dakşiņāgni, āhavaniya). After this the house-holder engages in waiting upon agni with vātsapra prayers or in a brief worship by repeating only ' bhūrbhuvaḥ syah &c.' ( Vāj. III. 37 ); then be pays silent homage to the ahavaniya and sits near it for a moment; then he sleeps or sits near the gārhapatya; then he performs paryukşapa for all the fires, then the householder breaks silence and performs doamana and then when he goes out be contemplates in mind the dakşiņāgni. The'wife also performs &camana ( at the end) silently. 

According to Kāt. (IV. 12. 1-2 ) the upasthana ( worship or homage ) of the fires in the evening after oblations are offered in agnihotra with the Vatsapra mantras (Vaj. S. III. 11. 36 and Sat. Br. II. 3. 4. 9-41 ) is optional and the householder may simply repeat one verse ( Vaj, 8. III. 37 and Sat. Br. II. 4. 1. 1-2). Āp. (VI. 16. 4 and 6) prescribes as upasthāna the six Verses upaprayanto' (Tai, S, I. 5,5 ) and several others, which are passed over for want of space. There were several views about upasthāna, some holding that upasthana was to be per formed only in the evening and not in the morning, others holding that it was to be performed at both times but only with the Vatsapra mantras ( Rg. X. 45 ) or with the Gosūkta (Rg. VI. 28 ) or Asvasūkta (Rg. I. 163 ). Vide Ap. VI. 19. 4-9 to VI. 23. 

Ap. (VI. 15. 10-13) has certain interesting rules about agni hotra in the case of kşatriyas. At first he says a kşatriya should permanently maintain the Xhavaniya fire, but he doen not perform the daily agnihotra. He should however send food from his house to a brāhmaṇa at the time when the agnihotra homa is ordinarily performed, whereby he secures the perfor. manoe of agnihotra, but the adhvaryu should make the rājanya recite the mantras of the worship of fire ( agngupasthāna noted above). A rājanya however who has performed somayaga and always speaks the truth may perform agnihotra daily. Asv. (II. 1. 3-5 ) says that a kşatriya (and a vaibya ) may perform agnihotra on the New Moon and Full Moon days, that on other 

Oh. XXIX) 

Srauta Sacrifices-Agnihotra 

1007 

days he should send oooked food to a brahmana who is devoted to his duties and that a ksatriya or vaišy& who always abides by truth ( in thought and word) and has offered a soma saori fice may engage in daily agnihotra, It is probable that these rules were made to allow more time to ksatriyas and vaisyas for their chief occupations. According to Ap. VI. 15. 14-16, Ašv. II. 4. 2-4 and others the householder should every day personally perform the Agnihotra, but if he cannot do that, he must do it personally at least on parva days and on other days 

a priest, & pupil or a son may perform bis agnihotra for him. 

The procedure in the morning agnihotra is the same as the evening agnihotra except in a few details e. g. the paryuksana mantra in the morning is different in Aúv. II. 4. 25 'satyasta. bhyam tvā paryuksāmi', while in the evening it is 'plasatya bhyam tvā &o.'( Asv. II. 2, 11 ), the samidh is offered into fire in the morning with the mantra 'hariņim tvā sūrysjyotişam aharistakām-upadadhe svāha' (while in the evening the mantra is 'rajatām tvāgnijyotişam rātrim-istakām-upada dhe svaba' Aøv. II. 4. 25 and II. 3. 15 ); the mantra in offering an oblation of milk in the fire in the morning is 'bhürbhuvah svarom, süryo jyotir jyotiḥ sūryaḥ svāba', while in the evening the word ' agniḥ' is substituted for sūryaḥ' (Aßv. II. 4. 25 and II. 3. 16). Vide Kāt. IV. 15 for further details. 

The gūtras set out rules about what the householder is to do when he leaves his home for one night or for a longer period. Vide Sat. Br. II. 4. 1. 3-14, Ašv. II. 5, Ap. VI. 24–27, Kat, IV. 12. 13-24. According to Aév, the important rules are: he kindles the fires into flames, sips water (aoamana) and performs the worship of the abavaniya, gārhapatya and dakşiņāgni by going near them and repeating respectively the three mantras 

samsya paśün me pahi', 'narya prajām me pahi' and' atharva pitum me pahi'(all three in Vāj. S. III. 37). Then while stand ing near the dakşiņāgni he should look at the other two with the mantra ' imān me mitrāvaruņāu grbān gopāyatam ...... punar dyanat' (Kathaka S. VII. 3., Mai, S. I. 5. 14, with variations ). He then traces the same way back and comes to the dhavaniya and offers worship to it with the mantra 'mama nāma' (Tal. S. 1. 5. 10.1, quoted in note 553 above). He should then start on his journey without looking back at his fires and should mutter the hymn 'mā pranama.' When he reaches a place from which the roof of his fire-house is not visible he may break silence. On reaching the road leading from his house to1008

[ Ch. XXIX 

his destination he should recite 'sada sugaḥ' (Rg. III. 54. 21 ). When he returns from his journey to his village, he should repeat' epi pantham' ( Rs. VI. 51. 16). He should then observe silence, take fuel-stioks in his hand and on learning that his fires have been kindled into flames (by his son or pupil ) he should look at the Chavaniya with two versos (set out in Ašv. II. 5. 9). Then placing the semidhs he does homage to the ābavaniya with the verse 'mama nama tava ca' (Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 1) and then he places samidhs on the ahavaniya, gārbapatya and dakşiņāgni with one mantra each (which are V&j, S. III. 28-30). 

These rules apply when the house-holder alone goes on & journey leaving the wife at home. When the house-holder is away alone it is his duty to perform all aotions at the time of agnihotra and darsapürņamāsa (such as sipping water) which he can perform without his fires and to go mentally 2190 through the whole procedure and to observe all yratas (such as subsisting on roots and fruits when required). Vide Ap. IV. 16. 18, Kāt. IV, 12, 16 and com. thereon. When he goes on a journey alone he should entrust his fires to his wife and should appoint & priest to perform the necessary rites ( vide note 1634 above ). When the house-holder starts on a journey accompanied by his wife he should take bis fires with him. If both husband and wife go on a journey without taking their fires with them, then a priest cannot offer the agnihotra homa in their absence and on return the house-holder has to again set up the fires ( has to perform punarādhāna ).8871

CHAPTER XXX 

DARSA-PŪRŅAMĀSA 2272 

The Darsapārņamāsa gaorifice is the pattern or archetype (pra. krti) of all other iştis (which are called vikệtis or modifications). The srauta sūtras therefore describe first the Darsapūrpamāga at length, though in the order of time agnyadhana comes first. Asy. II. 1. 1 says that all işçis, sacrifices in which an animal is offered and those in which somis offered are explained by the Paurņamāsa işti. According to Ap. III. 14. 11-13 & person, after he sets up the tbree fires, bas to perform the Darsapürna māsa throughout his life ( till he becomes a samnyasin) or for thirty years ( after which he may stop ) or till he becomes very old (and unable to perform the rite ).3213 

The word ' amāvāsya' literally means 'the day when (the sun and the moon) dwell or are together.' It is that tithi (day) on which both the sun and the moon are the nearest to each otber, while paurņamāsi is the tithi on which the sun and the moon are at the greatest distance from each other.' Pūrņamāsa means that moment when the moon is full.' Darga has the same sense as amāvisya. Darsa is taken to mean 'the day on wbich the moon is seen only by the sun and by no one else.'

A aketob of the darsapürnamāsa işti is given below princi pally based upon the srautasutras of Satyaşadha and Asvaldyana. 

One who has performed agnyadheya should begin the performance of darsapūrpamāsa on the first Bull Moon day after it. The işti on the Full-moon day may occupy two days, but all the actions to be performed in it can be compressed into one day. * If extended over two days it is performed on the full moon day and the pratipad (the first day of the dark half that follows the Full Moon day), the former being oalled upavasatha day 1398 and the latter yajaniya day. On the upavasatha day agnyan vādhana (offering fuel-stioks into fire) and paristarana aro performed in the case of the pürnamāga rite and on the yajaniya day the rest is performed. If it is the first pürpamāsa işti or the first darša işti, then the saorificer has to perform the Anvārambhaniya işti, which is briefly described in the note below, 1973 

On the morning of the full moon day the sacrificer, after the performance of bis daily agnihotra, sitting on a seat of darbhas to the west of the gārbapatya, holding kusa grass in his band and performing prāpāyāma and accompanied by his wife, makes a sankalpa (resolve ) As noted below.378 Then he says to the four priests viz., adhvaryu, brahma, hotf and Agnidhra

"I choose thee, so and so by name, as my adhvaryu, as my brahma, as my hotę and as my dgnidhra.' The adhvaryu takes fire from the gārbapatya, carries it to the dhavanlya mound and also to the dakşiņāgni mound and places a fuel-stiok with its end to the east on the Abavaniya with the verse 'mamagne Varco '*979 (Rg. X. 128. 1, Tai. 8. IV. 7. 14. 1). The adhvaryu and sacrifioer perform japa by muttering three verses*280 (from Tai, Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 71 ). While he is between the two fires ( Ahavaniya and gārhapatya) he mutters standing a verse 'antarāgni...manişaya' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4). Then he offers a samidh into the gārhapatya fire with Rg. X. 128.2 (=Tai. 8. IV. 7. 14. 1.' mama devā vihave'). The adhvaryu and saori fioer mutter two verses ' iba prajā &c.' and 'iba pašavo' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4, Sat. I. 2. p. 71). The adbvaryu then places a samidh on the dakşiņa fire with 'mayi deva'(Rg. X. 128. 3, Tai. S. IV, 3. 14. 1). Then the two mutter a verse 'ayam pitšņām' (Tai, Br. III. 7. 4). Those who maintained sabhya and avagathya fires offered samidhs to them with mantras"28) (from Tai. Br. III, 7. 4). 

If the sacrificer is one who has already performed a soma sacrifice then he has to go through the ceremony oalled sākha. harapa'. Such & sacrificer had to offer sānnāyya (which is 

2279. A mantra is ordinarily to be rocited after saying 'on'. But this is not the rule in srauta rites and so this has not been stated in the text everywhere. The fuel-stick may be offered either by the sacrificer or by the adhvaryu ( Kat. II. 1. 2).

The order of fires was, tocording to somo, first garbapatys, thon dakplpagni, then thavaniya (Est. II. 1. 6). Some said that only tho vydartia wore to be attored when offering fuol-stioks (Ap.

prepared by adding to fresh heated milk the sour milk or ourds of the preceding night's milking ).2289 According to the Tai. S. II. 5. 4. 1 sānnāyya was offered only by a somayaji. Sānnayyu was offered to Indra or Mahendra (Sat. Br. I. 6. 4. 21 and Kat. IV. 2,10). The Tai, S. II. 5. 4. 4 says that only one who is gatasri (explained above in note 2259 ) can offer sānnayya to Mahendra, while Sat. (I. 4 p. 103 ) says that for & year or two after som& yāga the sānnāyya should be offered to Indra and then to Mahendra. In the full moon işti the deities to whom purodāsa (oake ) is offered are Agni and Agnişoma and in it ajya is offered to Prajapati silently between the two purodāsas. In the new moon işçi the deities of puroddsa are Agni and Indrāgni and sānnāyya is offered by a somayāji to Indra or Mahendra instead of the purodāsa to Indragni( Āsv. I. 3, 9-12 ). 

Now Sakhāharana ( which applies only to him who bas performed soms-yāga and only in darseşti ) will be described. The adhvaryu fetohes & fresh branch of the palasa or sami tree, which (branoh) is taken from the eastern, northern or north-east side of the tree, which has many leaves and which has not a dried up end. Vide Jai. IV. 2.7 about the text 'he brings a branch turned to the east' &o. He outs it off with the words "işe tva' (Tai. 9. I. 1.1.1), then touches water, makes it straight or wipes it down with 'ūrje tva' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 1. 1), brings it towards the sacrificial ground with a verse 

imam prāolm' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Ap. I. %. 1, Sat. I. %, p. 76). With that branch he drives away (or separates ) from their mothers six calves with the mantra 'vāyavas sthopāyavas atha '(Tal. 8. I. 1. 1. 1). The adhvaryu makes the cows ( of the sacrificer) start for the pasture with the mantra 'dovo vaḥ savitą prārpayatu...ma yah stena Isata magbasamgah (Tal. 8. I. 1. 1), invokes them, when they have started, with a mantra suddhi apab suprapane pibantih' (Rg. VI. 28. 7, Tal. Br. II. 8. 8 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 79). Then be returns to the house of the sacrificer with dhruvā asmin......bahvih' (Tai 8. I 1.1) and keeps the branoh in a well-known place ( 80 that it might not fall or be lost) on the sacred fire ground or on a wooden frame near the fires with 'protect the cattle of the sacrificer' (Tai. 8. I. 1.1). Jai. (IIL. 6. 28-29) states that bathaharapa is meant for both evening and morning milking.

The mantras are short prose formulæ whioh occur in the Tai. 8. I, 1. %. They are not set out in detail here. The various stages are: be ( adhvaryu) takes up a sickle or the rib of a horse or ox kept to the north of the gārhapatya with the famous mantra 

devasya tvā savituḥ prasave ..... Idade' (I take thee at the impulse of God gevity &o.). He pays homage to the gārba patya with a mantra. The sickle (but not the rib) is heated on the gārhapatya fire. He then goes to the east or north of the sacrificial ground (vihāra) for some distance, finds out a spot where the desired grass grows, leaves aside one clump of darbhas from those growing there and marks as many clumps of darbha As he feels would be enough for his purpose, leaves one clump or one or two blades with the words, 'I leave you aside as the portion of beasts', touches those darbhas that he intends to cut with 'this is for the gods', holds them by his closed fingers of the left hand), rubs them upwards with his right hand, brings the siokle in close contact with them, repeats a mantra over the grass and outs off as much as can be held in his closed fingers the nails of which touch each other. This first handful of blades that are out is oalled prastara. Then he further outs an uneven number of handfuls of darbhas (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ), 4286 repeating the same processes and mantras for each handful, touches the stumps from whioh blades are out off with the mantra 'God Barhis! may you grow into a hundred shoots' and touches the region of his heart with may

In this way three or five handfuls are sur. rounded by & cord, which has its and stretched on the ground towards the east or north. Then heaps of blades are added on and over the last heap the prastara is placed. The whole is then firmly bound with the cord and a knot is made. He takes hold of the bundle thus tied, raises it up, places it on his head, returns with it by the way he went, keeps it inside the vedi on some grass (and not on the bare ground) near the spot where the middle paridhi would be. He pronounoes over the barbis thus placed & mantra and keeps the barbis near the gārbapatya on a mat or the like. He also outs off silently and brings along with barhis other darbhas called paribhojaniya and dried up kusa grass also (ulaparāji). 8888 

Idhmāharana (bringing the wood-sticks ). Twenty-one wood-sticks of palāsa or khadira are required, out of which 15 are meant for throwing into the fire at the time of repeating the sāmidheni verses, three are paridhis, 2887 two samidhs are to be used at the two aghāras and the 21st is the stick for anīyājas. A cord la made of darbhas and spread on the ground with its end to the north, the idhma is heaped on it with a mantra (Ap. I, 6.1, Sat. I. 2. p. 89). The bundle is tied with the cord and a knot is made and the idhma is laid alongside of the barhis. The pieces of wood that are thrown off when cutting the idhma are called idhmapravrascana. A bunch of darbbas called veda is made of the size of the knee of a calf by doubling and tying the darbhas with a cord and cutting the

darbhan about one epan above the tying oord and a mantra is repeated over it (* Tedosi' &o. in Sat. I. 2. p. 90). This veda is employed in sweeping the vedi with a mantra. It is given to the wife when she has to repeat a mantra in any action (compare Asv. I. 11. 1). The out portions of darbhas of which veda is formed are oalled veda-parivāsana. These two, idhma. pravradcana and veda-parivāsana, are placed together. He takes up a branch, outs off its leaves (but not all) inside the vedi, so chisels one end of it as to make of it a shovel. This is called upaveşa 1988. He recites a mantra over it (upavososi... bhavasi naḥ, Ap. I. 6. 7, Sat. I. 3. p. 91). In the Full moon Bacrifice the upsvega is made silently. He places on the upavesa a triple (made of three darbhas) band of darbhas in such a way that the roots and end portions of both are in contact but they are not tied together into a knot over it. The sacrificer invokes this triple band called pavitra with a mantra 'trivst palāse &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4, Ap. L 6. 10, Sat. I. 3. p. 92). 

After this in the afternoon the piņda-pitfyajia la perfor. med in the darkeşti, but not in the purpamasa işti. Pinda pitryajña is separately described below. 

If the sacrificer has celebrated the soma saorifice at some time then he has to perform sāyam-doha. When the house holder has offered the evening agnihotra, he spreads darbhas to the north of the gārbapatya, washes the sānnayya utensils (that are the same as are required for sāyam-doba ) in twos and lays them on the darbhas with their mouths turned downwards.

He places the sakhāpavitra with its tip to the east ( to the north in the morning milking ) in the ukha with a mantra, touches.the ukha and restrains his speeob **98 holding the sākhāpavitra. The person who is to milk the cow takes the abhidhāni ( the rope ) with 'adityai rāsnasi' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 2. 2) and the two nidāna ropes silently and makes the calf join the cow with thou art Pūşan'. The adhvaryu issues a direction that no one is to pass between the cow that is being suoked by the calf and the sacrificial ground ( vihara ) and all obey it. The adhvaryu invokes the cow with a mantra and the milker sits down near the cow to milk her with a mantra.2284 The householder repeats a mantra when the cow is being milked and another when he hears the sound of the streams of milk falling into the vessel. The milker brings the milk to the adhvaryu, who asks him 'whom did you milk, declare to us, ( this is ) an offering to Indra, it is vigour'. The milker refers to the cow by her name (such as Ganga ) and adds 

in whom milk has been placed for gods and men'. The adhvaryu replies 'she (the cow named) is the life of all'. The adhvaryu places the pavitra in the kumbhi (or ukha ) and pours therein the milk across the pavitra with a mantra. The adhvaryu gets two more cows milked in the same manner (i. e. with the same mantras &c.) except the directions ( such as no one should come &o.). The only difference is that the names of the cows will be different (such as Yamuna ) and that the 2nd and 3rd cows are referred to by him respectively as 'visva vyacaḥ 'and' višvakarma' instead of 'visvāyuḥ' (in his prati Veoana ). After three cows are milked he loudly utters thrice milk much for Indra, may the offering (havya) inorease for the gods, for the calves, for men; be ready for milking again. If there are more cows ( generally six are referred to) they also are got milked with the same mantras as for the first cow or silently and the adhvaryu does not hold his tongue, nor does he

touch the kumbhi while the other cows are being milked. Jai. (XI. 1. 47-53) concludes that the passage of Tai. Br. about milk. ing the other three cows is a mere anuvada and not a vidhi and Sabara quotes passages of the sruti that on that night no agnihotra is offered with milk and the children in the house do not get any milk ( as all milk is used up for the sānnayya ). When all are milked, if any drops have fallen about (on the ground &o. ) he repeats a mantra (Tai. 8. I. 1. 3. 1) and invokes the pot in which sānnayya is to be prepared with a mantra. He washes the inside of the milking vessel with water and then pours that water into the pot (in which sānnayya is to be prepared). He heats the milk and pours over it (i. 0. does abhigharana ) clarified butter silently. He draws the heated pot from the burning coals in euch a way as to make a line on the ground and places it to the east, north or Dorth-east with a mantra. When the bottom of the heated vessel cools, he adds ourds to it in order to coagulate the fresh milk with 'I add soma ( i. e. ourds) to thee in order to turn thee into curds for Indra' (Tal. S. I.1.3).1998 He adds to the vessel what remains sticking to the pot or sruo after agnihotra was offered with & mantra or silently. He pours water in the vessel that is meant as a lid or oover and places that cover or lid on the pot of heated milk. If the covering be of earthenware he throws thereon grass or a twig. He takes out the sākhāpavitra with a mantra (if a palāsa branch was used) or silently ( if one of sami was used) and keeps it in a secure place. He keeps the sānnayya in the garbapaty& side of the vibāra on a dikya or some such contrivance with 'O Vişnu, guard the offering '. 

He brings another branch with which or with darbhas he separates the calves for the morning milking (on the principal day). The game procedure as for sāyamdoha is followed in the 

2295. There were several views hore about adding ourds. One, two or throo cows are milked on the day previous to the upavasatha day (i... on the 14th ) and that milk is used to acidify the fresh beated milk of tho svoning of the upavasatha day. Another method was to milk tho cow or cows on the 12th, then to add the cords of that to the milk of the 13th day and add all the curds of those two days to the milk of the 14th day i. o. milking and adding of curds was to go on continuously from the 12th, 13th and 14th or from 13th or from 14th.

morning milking (of the principal day). There are a few differences as to mantras, as to not adding coagulating sub stance, whioh are passed over. 

After the sāyandoha (evening milking) the adhvaryu directs (Agnidhra or some other priest or himself) strew kuša grass round the fires, first round abavanlys, then gārhapatya, then dakşiņāgni' or the order may be first gārhapatys, then dakşiņāgni and lastly ahavaniya. The darbhas strewn on the south and north have tips turned to the east. The sacrificer mutters & mantra when kušas are being strewn. 

Having done so much he observes the amāvāsy& as an upavasatha. Thus on the amāvāsyā day he performs agnyan vādhāna (offering fuel-stioks into fires), separating the oalves with the branch, sāyamdoha, bringing barhis and idhma, pre paring the veda and vedi and observing some vows. But two of these viz. separating calves from their mothers and sāyam. doha are performed only by him who has already performed a soma sacrifice. In the case of the pūrpamāsa işti if spread over two days, on the Full moon day only agnyanvādhana and strewing kušas round the fires are gone through and on the next day are performed the bringing of barbis and idhma and making of veda and all the other rites. If the işti is to be performed in one day only, then kusa grass is strewn round the fires after the making of the veda bunch. 

About tānnāyya Sat. states some divergent views. The Kapeyas beld that even one who has not performed soma-yaga may offer sānnāyya and the deity in his Cage will be Indra and after he offers Soma, the deity for sānnayya will be Mahendra. According to Sabara on Jai. X. 8. 44 the Gopa yanas beld that one who has not performed a soma sacrifice may offer sānnāyya. According to Sat, himself, for a year or two after Somay&ga the deity will be Indra and then Mahendra if the sacrificer go desires. Persons of the Aurva and Gautama gotras and those who are gatasri ( vide note 2259 ) may if they like offer sānnayya to Mahendra even before performing Somayaga. Compare Ap. I. 14. 8-11 and vide Jai. X. 8. 35-46 (about the two purodāgas and sānnayya). 

On the principal day (i. e, the first day of the dark half in the case of pörpamāsa) the sacrificer offers his daily agnihotra before sunrise and begins after sunrise the performance of the pürnamāsa işti (and in the case of the darkești before sunrise ).

He washes his hands with water with the mantra “May I be able to carry out this rite meant for you two and for gods" (Tai, 8. I. 1. 4. 1). From the place of the gārhapatya fire to the havaniya he spreads a line of dry kusa grass continuously with their tips to the east (without leaving any space uncovered) with the mantra 'thou art the continuity of the sacrifice, I spread thee for the continuity of sacrifice, thee for the conti nuity of the sacrifice' (Tai. Br. III. 2.4) and then spreads another line of kuras to the south and another to the north of this first line silently. To the south of the āhavaniya, seats of kusa grass are made ready for the brahmā priest and the saori ficer, that of the brahma being to the east of the seat of the sacrificer and directly to the south of the ābavaniya and of the sacrificer to the south of the south corner of the east side of the vedi. To the north of gārhapatya kušas are strown with their tips to the east or north and on them the sacrificial implements (yajñapātras ) are placed in twos after being washed with water and with their mouths turned down, viz., the sphya and kapālas &o. (vide above note 2233 for the ten). This is called pātrāsādana (placing the utensils near ) 4388 

Then follows brahmavarana. 

The sacrifioer sitting on a seat with his face to the north then chooses his brahmā priest who faces the cast near the utkara with the formula 2399 01 Lord of the earth I Lord of the worlds / Lord of great being (Heaven?)! I choose thee as brahmā' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The brahmā priest when 80 chosen mutters a long formula ( which is given in Ap. III. 18. 4 from the Tai. Br. III. 7.6 and part of which is translated here ) *I am the Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds, lord of the great being. Being impelled by god Savitr I shall perform the duties of a priest.

Then he loudly says 'O Bphaspati, protect the sacrifice '(ibid.) and cross ing the altar by the west of the āhavaniya towards the south of the āhavanlya, stands to the south of bis seat with his face to the north, takes a kusa blade from the blades on the seat prepared for him, casts it to the south-west (the direction of Nir-şti, ill-luck) with the words 'avaunt,9298 Daidhiņa vya (son of a re-married widow ?), get up from this place, occupy the seat of another, who is more ignorant than me' (Tai. 8. III. 2. 4. 4.), touches water and sits down on his seat with face to the east with a mantra and then faces the abavaniya with a mantra 'Here do I, impelled by God Savits, sit on the seat of Vasu (or prosperity) lower in level ( than the dhavaniya mound), I oocupy the seat of Bșhaspati, this I declare to Agni, to Vāyu, to the Sun, to the Earth'(vide Ap. III.18.4, Kat, II. 1.24). The brahma is required to be the most learned in Vedio lore' ( brahmiştha, as Ap. III. 18. 1 says) and he is to observe silence while mantras are being repeated and superintends all actions. His permission is asked by the adhvaryu at the time of doing most of the sots, such as leading forward the pranitā water, sprinkling the bundle of fuel-sticks and kusa grass. There are four priests in darsa pūrņamāsa ( vide note 2228 ). The sacrifioer also crosses by the west side of the dhavaniya to its south, tbrows away silently & blade of kuša from his seat and then sits down on the seat prepared for him, with his face to the east. The adhvaryu takes two darbhas of equal thickness, the tops of which are not cut off and makes them a span in length by cutting off their roots (without using his nails ). 2209 

The adhvaryu, sitting to the west (or north ) of the gārha patya fire, takes & camasa (a rather flat vessel or pan) in which water is to be carried forward with 'to thee for Dakşa' (Ap. I. 17. 1) and washes it thrice with water once with mantra and twioe silently. The mantra is 'thou art made of plants, may

He keeps the two pavitras in the camasa and pours water in the camasa with who takes you, let him take you, for whom shall I take you, I take you for him, you for prosperity (Ap. I. 16. 3) and at the same time contemplates on the Earth with 'I take you with this' (not uttered). He fills the vessel so as to leave some space at the top and purifies the water by the process called utpavana (desorib. ed above in note 2291 ). He then invokes them with 'may the divine waters, that are the first purifiers and the leaders carry this sacrifice to the front, may they place the lord of the sacrifice in front, Indra chose you in his fight with Vitra, you chose him in the fight with Vộtra, you are sprinkled '(Tai. 8. I. 1.5. 1). The adhvaryu then asks the permission of the brahmā priest in the words 'Brahman) shall I carry forward the water' and lesues a direction sacrificer, observe silence'. The brahma priest mutters & mantra * Lead forward the sacrifice, Bustain these deities, may the sacrificer be on the baok of heaven. Place this sacrifice and the sacrifioer in the world where the seven sages and other men of holy deeds dwell'and loudly says'yes, do carry the water forward'. The adhvaryu then repeats the verse who carries you forward? Let him oarry you forward. I carry for ward the divine waters; may they sit round our sacrifice, conveying to the sacrificer thousandfold prosperity, the waters that delight in drink, having a shining (or oily ) appearance'. He holds the water in & vessel which is covered by the sphya that has its tip to the east and that is held level with his nose and carries it forward without allowing even a drop to fall down. When the water is being carried the sacrificer invokos it with a mantra, 9800 The adhvaryu places the water vessel (pranitāpātra ) on darbha grass to the north of the ahavaniya with the mantra 'you are sanotified by brahma ( prayers ); who employs you ? Let him employ for securing) all desires, for the worship of gods (Ap. IV. 4. 4)' and then covers the vessel with kusas. All these acts constitute pranitāpranayana. While the water is being placed near the Ahavaniya the sacrificer invokes it with the immediately preceding mantra and passes his eye over the whole of the sacrificial ground. No one is to pass between the dhavaniya and the prapita water (Kat. II. 3. 4).

1023 

The principal purpose of the pranita waters is that they are used for making the ground grains into & dough for purodass and their final disposal is to be poured into the vedi (Jal. IV, %. 14-15). The adhvaryu comes back by the same way that he went, places down the sphya among the yajšapātras and touobes the sacrificial utensils with his hand wearing a pavitra with the mantra 'may the divine groups enter into the sacrificial utensils'. 

Then follows nirvāpa 1301 (taking out handfuls of grains or a portion of other sacrificial material). The adhvaryu takes in his hand the ladle called agnibotra-havani with thou art made of a tree for dakşa' (strength). Then he holds it in his left hand and takes the winnowing basket ( sūrpa ) in his right hand with 'to thes for the all-pervading (yajña). Then he heats it (ladle ) on the garbapatya fire with 'the rakšas (avil spirit) is burnt, the enemies are burnt. He then touches water.1308 The adhvaryu asks the permis sion of the sacrificer in the words *sacrificer I shall I take out sacrificial material' and the sacrificer replies 'yes, do take out'. The edhvaryu then utters the words 'I go towards the wide space and approaches & cart or wooden frame (sakata ) standing to the west of the ahavaniya or gārban patya containing either rice or barley grains (in the busk), which has the shafts turned to the east or north, which has the yoke joined to it and is covered with mats. While touching the right side of the yoke he mutters * thou art dhûr ( destruc tive fire), injure the destructive (enemy), destroy him wbo seeks to destroy us and whom we seek to destroy'. He touches the left shaft and mutters the mantra 'thou art of the gods (i.e. belongest to them ), thou art the purest (or the most generous ), the fullest, the dearest, the best carrier, the best summoner of the gods'.

He makes an opening by removing the mats covering the sakata and looks at the corn to be used for making the purodāsa and at the mats while repeating twice the mantra 'I look at thee with the eye of Mitra, do not be afraid, do not tremble, I shall not injure thee'. He touches the corn (to be used for purodaśa) with 'may you sustain strength', then touches his own heart with 'put milk in me' and touches water. Then he throws aside a blade of grass or olod of earth with warded off is the evil spirit", touches water and repeats the Dasahotę mantras, 1308 He places the two pavi. tras in the winnowing basket (silently), takes one handful of the grain (from the cart) with 'may the five fingers give you for protection, and not to the enemy' (Maitri. yaniya 8, L 1. 5), puts (empties) the handful in the sruo (agnihotrabavanl) and puts in the winnowing basket (on whioh the two pavitras have been kept ) four handfuls of grain by means of the agnihotra-bavapi, three with the mantra (repeated thrice )' at the command of god Savity, with the arms of Ašvins, with the hand of Pūşan I take out theo that art dear to Agni'8304 and the fourth silently. Jai. (IX. 1. 36-37) concludes that this mantra is the same even in all modifications of the darkapārņamāsa and Sabara explains 'savituḥ prasave' as meaning 'urged by the yajamāna' (or when the sun rises), * abving' as meaning the sacrificer and his wife ( as they make & gift of the horse in agnyādheya) and pūşan as meaning 

yajamāna 'himself (who supports all). In Jai. XI. 4. 44-45 it is stated that the mantra for nirv&pa 'doyabya tva', the mantra for cutting off barbis ( barbirdevasadanam dāmi) are to be repeated and not to be uttered only once. In Jai. V. 2. 4-5 it is established that all the garnskāras are to be performed on all the grains after four handfuls are taken and not on each handful as it is taken out. The sacrificer invokes with a mantra while the adhvaryu is making the nirvāpa 'I call here Agni, the hots and the gods that are well dispoged to sacrifice ; may the gods, pleased in mind, come and may they partake of this my offering.

If no cart is available, he keeps an earthen vessel on the sphya placed on the altar with its tip to the north or east and takes out the grains from that vessel ( this is the modern practice ) and then removes the wooden sword from 

underneath it. The same procedure is followed in the case of purodāsas for other deities. The adhvaryu touches the grains taken out with 'this of the gods and touches the rest (remaining in the sakata or vessel ) with this is ours together ( with the gods ).' He invokes the grains taken out with 'I take (or invoke ) thee for increase and not for malevolence.' He moves out of the mats covering the cart (or from near the vessel) taking with him the sürps with 'thee I release from the fetters of Varuna' (compare Maitriyani S. I. 1.5). He looks at the sacrifioial ground, the fires, the utensils, the priests with 'may I see heaven' and at the ahavaniya with the light of Vaišv.. nara ( Agni).' He gets down from the cart with 'may the posts (or mansions ) of Heaven and Earth, stand firm' ( if corn is taken from a vessel he only mutters these words ). He invokes the grains that have fallen down ( when four handfuls were taken out) with 'to Heaven and Earth, svāha' and goes near the gārhapatya with 'follow wide space (or sky)' He puts down the sūrpa ( containing the corn taken out) near the gārhapatya to its west ( or near that fire on which in that particular rite he has to bake the cake) with 'I make you sit on the lap of Aditi 1805 and consigns it to the protection of that deity (for which the cake is meant) with 'O fire protect the saorificial material.'3306 The adhvaryu pours water in the (agnihotrabavaņi) ladle to which the awns of the rice or barley grains stiok and purifies it thrice with the two pavitras (blades of kuģa ) held in the hands and with the mantra 'may god Savitf &o.' (vide p. 1024 above) and invokes it with 'may the divine waters' &o. Then the adhvaryu seeks the permission of the brahmā priest with 'Brahman) shall I sprinkle' (with holy water the sacrificial material).

He then upturns the sacrifioial utensils (i. e. instead of their mouths being down, their mouths are now upturned) and sprinkles them thrice with water with 'may you become pure for divine rite, for worship of gods. 1807 The rest of the water taken for sprinkling is placed to the east of the garbapatya (in a sruo). It is stated by Jaimini ( IX. 1. 2-3 ) that the prokşaps of the mortar and pestle or the mill-stones has an unseen spiritual result ( apūrva). 

The adhvaryu sits to the west of the gārbapatya, takes hold of the black antelope skin lying on the altar with 'thou art the whirl of the wind' and shakes it thrice on the utkara holding it in such a way that the neok portion is up and the hairy portion inside (towards himself) with destroyed is the evil spirit, destroyed are the enemies'. To the west of the utkara he spreads the antelope 3308 skin with its neck portion westwards (Sat. Br. I. 1. 4. 5 ) and its hairy portion upwards with "thou art the skin of Aditi'. The portion $89 of the skin near the anus (of the animal) is twisted below the hairless part and both parts are held together with 'may the earth know thee'.

(the mantra is recited only once according to Jai. XI. 4. 42). After striking thrice the adhvaryu utters & summons to havişkệt, with 'come, O Havişkšt' (repeated thrice )8311.

strike silently with the yoke-pin ( samya) instead of using a stone (Ap. I. 20. 4). He repeats this thrice (i. e. striking with a stone or yoke-pin is done nine times in all). After this the gacrificer's wife or some one else (such as the ag nidhra ) threshes the grains in the mortar ( Kāt. II, 4. 14). Jai. (XI. 1. 27 ) states that the beating has & seen purpose (viz, removal of husk) and so it is to be continued as long as required for effect. ing that purpose. Jai. (IV. 2. 26 ) further lays down that the Vedio sentence 'vrlbin-avahanti' is a restrictive injunction ( niyamavidhi ) in that, when unhusking can be effected either by using the mortar and pestle or by some other method (such by using the nails ) it restricts one to the former method. The adhvaryu then holds the winnowing basket near the mouth of the mortar to its east or north with the words 'thou art grown by rain 1313 ( as it is made of bamboo ) and touches the beaten grains ( to be used for purodaša ) with you are grown by rain'. He then puts with his hand the beaten grains into the winnowing basket with 'may (the sūrpa ) know thee' (the grains as its own). Holding the sūrpa over the utkara he thrice winnows the grains and frees them from the husk ( which falls on the utkara ) with thrown away is the evil spirit, thrown away are the enemies'( i.e. the husks are meant to be the portion of evil spirits). He makes the husks stioking to the sūrpa fall on the utkara with 'blown away are the enemies'. He puts the husks from the place of the utkara over the (middle) potsherd (on which the cake is to be baked) and places them (the husks) underneath the black antelope skin in its north-west corner with thou art the portion of evil spirits'. He does not look at these huske. He presses down with his hand the spot where the busks are kept with pressed down is the evil spirit'. He touches water, sprinkles the potsherd ( on which the husks were) with water and keeps the potsherd in its place. He separates the husked and unhusked grains with 'may the wind separate you.' He then pours out the grains of rice from the sūrpa in the pot with the words 'may the god Savity with his golden hands (rays) accept you'.

The adhvaryu puts the kaņas ( little particles of rice grains ) separated from the polished grains of rice in & vessel, cleanses the polished grains that are in the sürp% with water. That portion which remains after the grains ara beaten thrice is made to flow towards the utkara with the water ( collected in another vessel) that is used in washing the polished grains with this is the portion of evil spirits.

Then the adhvaryu places the yoke-pin (samyā) with its head ( kumba, thick part) to the north on the antelope skin with thou art the support of the heavenly world'; he establishes 2314 the larger mill-stone ( drşad ) with its face to the east on the samyā in such a way as to cover the samgā with its western half with thou art intelligence ( though ) made of a stone; may the support of heaven know thee'; then he places the smaller mill-stone on the larger one with 'thou art intelligence (though) a obild of the mountain; inay the drşad know thee'. The adhvaryu then bends and looks at the polished grains that are in the sürpa with 'you are honeyed rays'. He spreads the polished grains on the larger mill-stone thrice with at the command of god Savitr...... hands of Pūşan'(vide p. 1024 for the omitted words). I spread you, you are corn, satiate the gods' and once silently. He draws the smaller mill-stone over the grains to the east with to thee for prapa '2815, to the west with 'to thee for apāna',

Ultimately he grinds towards the east with 'I hold this (smaller mill-stone) for the life ( of the sacri. ficer) in a long and continuous series 2318 of actions (here grind. ing)'. Thereafter he continuously grinds the grains at his pleasure. He throws the ground grains from the larger mill-stone with the smaller mill-stone on to the antelope skin with May God Savitr with bis golden hands (rays) accept you' and bends down to look at the ground grains with 'I look at you with an unimpaired eye.' He then issues a direction to the wife 'grind (or pound) without scattering ( the grains away from the larger mill-stone or from the antelope skin ) and make them into fine flour. Either the wife grinds or a maid-servant (dāsi) may do so (Ap. I. 21. 8-9 ); and then keeps aside the well ground flour in a well-known place. The adhvaryu heats on the gārbapatya water called madanti 2319 brougbt from the pranitā water. The offerings (of cooked vegetable food ) are cooked either on the garhapatya or on the āhavaniya fire. 

The adhvaryu, after sitting to the west of the garbapatys, takes the upevega with thou art dhřsti ( bold one ), give brahma (holy food ?). He separates two burning coals from the western portion of the gārhapatya fire with the upaves& and keeps them on the eastern side of the gārhapatya mound itself. He casts outside one of the two coals to the north-west of the gārbapatya with 'O Fire 1 Dash aside the fire that eats ( cooks ) raw food ( not cooked in accordance with sastra ); and forbid that fire that eats flesh (cooks ordinary meat food).' Ho tben touches water, places the remaining coal on that spot on the west ( of the gārbapatya mound where he has to place the potsherds ) with bring that fire that worships the gods.'

In modern times many agnihotrins do not generally employ eight or eleven potsherds but employ one earthen brick ( that would have the shape of the kapalas when placed together ), on which lines are scratched to indicate the number of kapālas. Then taking coils from the gārhapatya he spreads the coals on the potsherds (whether 8, 11 or more or less ) with the veda bunch repeating for each potsherd' may you be heated by the tapas of Bbřgus and Abgirases.' 

The adhvaryu heate the patri ( the purodaśa pātri, according to Kāt. II. 6. 49 ) that is washed with water on the fire on which the cake is to be baked and when it is heated and slightly cooled he places the pavitras on it and pours on to it across the pavitras the flour (of ground and bruised grains) from the black antelope skin with the yajus mantra 1320 'devasya tvā ... agnaye justam sarvapāmi' thrice and once silently. While pouring the ground grains he restrains bis speech and gives up the restraint only when he spreads holy ashes over the purodāsa ( vide below). He purifies the flour by moving for wards and backwards and raising up the two pavitras (darbha blades ) the tips of which are turned northwards thrice ( i. e. he performs utpavana) once with the mantra 'haryos-tvā vārd bhyām-ut-punāmi' or with the mantra 'devo vah' (vide note 2291 above). He takes in the sruva ladle water from the pranitā water, and supporting it on the veda bunch pours that water on the flour with & mantra 'waters have joined with waters &c.' (Tai. $. I. 1. 8. 1 ) and also pours thereon the hot water from the madanti vessel with the mantra 381 you are generated from waters' and mixes the flour through and through on all sides with the water from left to right with * may you be well mixed up with water (Tal. S. I. 1. 8. 1). He stirs and mixes the flour and water with the mek sana **** with. I mix thee together for generation', and makes a ball( of the flour) with thou art the head of the sacrifice'.

divides the ball into two parts with 'may you (two) become separate according to the respective shares ( of the deities). He makes two balls of equal size from the dough and touches the two separately with this for Agni' and 'this for Agni and Soma.'1318 From the group of potsherds to the south be removes the burning coals with the veda bunch with 'Here do I remove the face from the approaching (or attacking ) army' and then removes the coals also from the group of potsherds that are to the north. Taking the ball of flour that is to be placed on the southern potsherds with thou art the head of the sacrifice' he bakes the ball with thou art heat and bestower of all life and similarly bakes the other ball on the northern group of potsherds in the same way. *334 He makes the cake assume the shape of a tortoise, but its back should be neither too high nor too low like an apūpa and the cake should be as large as the hoof of a horse 2825 He spreads the cake so that it covers all the potsherds with 'may thou spread wide'(i. e. have progeny &c.). He puts water in the vessel ( with the water from which the flour was mixed up) and sweeps the surface of the cake from left to right with his wet hand in such a way that the cake will have a skin-like continuous surface with mayst thou take on a skin'. He passes a burning firebrand thrice round each cake with vanished is the evil spirit, vanished are the enemies'. He applies over the cakes the flames of burning darbhas with 'may the god Savitr bake thee in the kindled (fire) called nāka'. He applies heat by passing round the cakes burning fire-brands with 'may fire not burn thy body! O Fire, protect the offering'. He spreads over the oake ashes in which there are also burning coals with 'mayst thou be connected with prayer'. The adbvaryu issues a direction ( to the Agnidhra ) "bake the cakes without burning them' and here he gives up the 

restraint of speech ( that was imposed as stated above ). 

He heats with a burning firebrand the water used for wiping the fingers and for scouring the vessels and draws with the sphya to the west of the abavaniya (or gārhapatya) three lines

To the west of the ahavaniya he constructs & vedi, which is in length as muoh as the height of the sacrificer or which is as long as required for one's purpose and which has curved sides. 3897 The sacrificer repeats a verse 'I make a mansion for him &o.'(Tai. Br. III. 7. 6) and touches the spot where the vedi is to be made. The adhvaryu sweeps the spot of the vodi with the veda bunch once with the mantra ' they knew the vedi by means of tbe veda bunch &o.' (Tai. Br.

He moves aside with the sphya the dust together with the out blade of darbha with struck aside is the demon Araru from the earth'. He removes the dust and the blade with the sphya outside the vedi towards the utkara 3380 with 'go to the cowpen, the place of the cows.' While this is being done the sacrificer recites by way of invo. cation 'O gods! I cut off with the bolt of Ipdra the head of him who hates me &c.' (Tai, Br. III. 7. 6). The adhvaryu looks at the vedi with 'may Heaven rain on thee' and at the sacrificer with "may rain shower on thee' The Qgofdhra sits down with the palms of his hands turned upwards to the north of the vedi and outside it on a spot at the distance of two padas (footsteps ) from the north side of the vedi with 'salutation to heaven and to the earth.'

The adhvaryu strikes the vedi with the spbys a second time and a third time and the same procedure is followed by him and by the Agni dbra as at the first striking except that one mantra is different for each priest at each of the two strikings. The adhvaryu strikes with the sphya a fourth time but silently and all actions of the first striking are repeated but without mantras. The adhvaryu removes all the remnants of the darbhas from the vedi, the yajamāna recites the invooatory verse 'I cut off the head' &o. and the agnidbra covers a fourth time with his hands with 'may Araru not spring upwards to thy heaven'. The adhvaryu then draws with the sphyx on the vedi a line from the south oorner of the west side of the vedi towards the east up to the southern shoulder (on the east side of the vedi) with ***l 'may the Vasus enfold you with the Gayatri metre'. He draws a line on the western side of the vedi towards the north with 'may the Rudras enfold thee with the Triştubh metre' and draws & line from the northern corner of the west side towards the east with 'may the Adityas enfold thee with the Jagati metre'. While this is being done the yajamina mutters & verse 'O Brhaspati, envelope the vedi &o.'.

or to the agnidbra or to the attendants if any) 'O men, make this vedi and make it occupied by the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas &o.' (Kathaka Sam. I. 9). The āgnidhra digs up with the sphya the upper layer of dust with 'Araru has been struok off from the earth, bring bere him who worships the gods' and oarries the dust so dug towards the utkara. When this is being done the sacrificer recites two texts. The āgnidhra digs the ground from west to east for making the vedi with 'at the prompting of God Savits, the worshippers do their work'. Whatever roots remain in the ground be removes with the sphya, and all dust that remains he removes to the utkara. The adhvaryu addresses the brahmā priest 'O brahman) shall I undertake the further enfolding of the vedi'. The brahma priest mutters a mantra 'O Bphaspati, enfold the vedi &o.' and loudly replies, 'Yes (om), do enfold'. He enfolds the vedi from the south, west, and north respectively 3836 with 'thou art rta (right), thou art the abode of sta, thou art the glory of sta'. The yajamāna mutters while this is being done a verse 'O Bphaspatil enfold the vedi' (same as the one recited by the brahma above). The adhvaryu says 'thou art dha ( support of the havis), thou art svadha (the source of pindas offered to Manes), thou art the wide earth, thou art rich' and makes the surface of the vedi level by means of the sphya from east to west. The yajamāna invokes the vedi with a mantra * Having become the earth, it nourished greatness &c.' (Tai. Br. III, 7.6). The adhvaryu addresses a mantra 1886 (Tai, S. I. 1. 9) to the vedi 'Ovirapšin | Before the cruel (Araru ) creeps out &o.', holds the sphya in a slanting position in a spot which is beyond ß of the length of the vedi from its western side and issues a direction 1337 'obtain or get down the

Then the agnidbra ( or adhvaryu) places two pavitras inside the agnihotrahavani (sruo), pours water into it, draws the sphya in a slanting position (from the spot where it had been held fixed) a short distance to the north thereby causing a furrowed line on the vedi, holds the sphya in the left hand inside the vedi and the agnihotrahavani in the right hand, drops & little water from the agnihotrabavani on to the furrowed line made by the sphya and places the agnihotrahavaņi ( con taining the water) on the spot where the sphya had been originally held fixed slantingly with 'O abode of pta.' The adhvaryu brings to his mind him whom the yajamāna hates, When the prokşaņi waters are being placed the yajamāna mutters a mantra. The adhvaryu throws the sphys in such a way that it falls on the utkara with thou art produced from a tree, thou hast a hundred points, thou art the death of the enemy.' Then seizing the sphyx with his fist by the bulging part thereof he draws it towards the east from the utkara. He washes his hands on the utkara and also the sphyx with water but does not touch with his bare hand the point of the sphya (i. e, he cleans the other parts of the sphyx with his hand by pouring the water thereon and cleans the point by only pouring water thereon ). To the north of the abavaniya he places with both hands the idhma and burhis, the latter to the north of the former. The sphya is placed near the praạitā waters to their west ( Kat. II. 6. 43). 

With the ends of the blades out off in making the veda bunoh he ( the agnidhra or adhvaryu himself) wipes the sruva and the three ladles viz. jubū, upabhrt and dhruva ), invokes them with you are not sharpened (and yet) you destroy our enemies."

He oleans the juhū ladle, the bowl by rubbing its inside several times from west to east with the tips ( of the out portions ), its outside from east to west with the middle portions and its rod with the roots with "may I not brush out speech and life-breath, I clean thee &c.' He cleans the upabhst, the inside from east to west ( as for sruva ), the outside from west to east with the middle portions and the rod with the roots with 'may I not rub out the eye and the ear, I clean thee &o.' He oleans the dhruva ladle as he did the gruva, with the difference that the mantra is 'may I not rub out progeny and home &c.' He does not allow & cleaned vessel to come in contaot with one that is not cleaned, but if they are brought in contact he again heats the vessel (already cleaned) and cleans it again. He takes up the vessel called prābitrabarana, 1838 heats it on the fire ( but without mantras ) and cleans it, the bowl with the tips (of cut blades ) on all sides from the outside to the inside and the rod with the roots with may I not brush out food, progeny and prosperity, I clean thee that art strong and subduest enemies', According to Ap.

Br. III. 3. % ). 

Then comes patnisannahana ( girding up of the sacrificer's wife). 

The ignidhra takes up the veda bunob, the ayasthāli, 2341 yoktra, and the two darbha blades used as puvitra. The wife ( of the sacrificer), while sitting to the south-west of the gārhepatys with knee raised up or standing is girt up by the āgoidhra (by the adhvaryu, according to com. on Ap. II. 5. 6 ) with the yoktra (oord of muñja grass) with the mantra, ' I hoping for a favour. ably disposed mind, progeny, good luck, beautiful body and observing the vratas of Agni, gird up myself for meritorious actions' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 10. 1). In modern practice the wife girds up her waist with the yoktra herself. He does not gird her up over the garment worn round the waist but inside it ( Ap. II. 5.5 says there is an option). The yoktra has a loop at one end in which the other end is inserted and the cord is passed round the waist of the wife twice, a knot like that of the top-knot (sikbā of & man) is made to the north of the navel with may Pūşan tie a knot for you' and it is drawn to the south of the navel from left to right. She waits upon ( does adoration to) the gārha patya by standing and saying O fire, Lord of the house, oall me near' Standing to the west of the gārbapatya she pays

adoration to the wives of the gods 1849 with 'May you wives of the gods summon me near you and she looks at the same spot (west of gārhapatya and not east) with 'O wife, O wife of the god) { this is thy world, salutation to thee, do not injure me'. She sits facing the north at a place which is south-west of the gārhapatya with May I have no widowed state just as Indrāni has none.3843 May I have good sons like Aditil O gārbapatya endowed with all means, I sit down near thee for good progeny' (Tai. Br. III. 7,5). On sitting down she mutters ( japati 3344 )'O firewe, who have virtuous husbands and who have good progeny, who are not treated with contempt, have sat down near thee, that destroyest enemies and that cannot be destroyed ( Tai. S. I. 1. 10. 1-2); may my sons be destroyers of enemies and my daughter be ruling (a queen); I also am victorious (over my co-wives) and my glory with my husband is highest ( Rg. X. 159. 3).' The Agnidbra opens the mouth of the big jar (covered with a piece of cloth or the like ) in which ghee has been stored with may Pūşan open thy mouth' and takes from it into another Vessel ghee that should be a little more than what would be required in the rite, heats it on the dakšiņa fire with Vispu traversed this' ( Rg. I. 22. 17). He takes up from the spot where all utensils have been placed the ajyasthali (pot for olarified butter) with 'thou art Aditi, whose pavitra is not cut off' and pours into that pot in wbich two pavitras are placed plenty of clarified butter *84$" thou art the milk of the great ones (the cows), the fluid of herbs, I take out from thee that art inexhaustible a portion for the worship of gods (this is the nir vāpa of clarified butter). He melts the butter in the djyasthall on the burning coals of the southern portion of the garbapatya 

2342. The region of the wives of the gods is to the west of the gürbapatya. 

2843. In Rg. X. 86. 11 (and Tai. 8. I. 7, 13. 1) we read MTATE नारिषु सुभगामहमभवरान हास्या अपरंचन जरसा मरते पतिर्विश्वस्मादिन्द्र उसर। 

2344. The com, on Sat. I. 7. p. 161 significantly remarks that the mantras to be repeated by the wife should be learnt by ber from her tather or bas band before agnyadhana 'एते मन्त्रा आधानारपूर्व पिता पत्यु सकाशावधीरय प्रयोज्या'. 

2845. The com, on Ap. II. 6. 1 notices that in the absence of gboo made from cow's milk, ghee made from the milk of a sho-buffalo or . sho-goat may be used as a substituto or ovos 808amo oil. But the mantra is the same (there is no wha of tho words referring to cows that oooor in the mantra ).

fire with to thee for sap', takes it down (from the coals ) with 'to thee for strength, holds it over the yeda bunch and hands both the pot and the veda bunch to the wife. She first closes her eyes and then holding her breath (opens her eyes and) looks down on the clarified butter with 'thou art the milk of cows; the fluid of herbs, I look on thes for securing good progeny with an invincible eye'(Tai. 8. I. 1. 10. 3). The agnidhra places the djyasthāll on the northern portion of the gārbapatya fire and melts it with thou art light'; he takes it from the fire with 'to thee for light' and carries it to the south of the dhavaniya with 'follow after light'. He melts it on that fire with 'may Agni not remove thy light'. He takes up the pot and returns by the way he went and places it with a mantra 'thou art the tongue of Agni' (Tai, S. 1 1. 10. 3) to the north of the prokşapi waters on the line drawn with the sphya, 

The adhvaryu and the yajamāna both close their eyes, holding their breath, (open their eyes and) look down upon the clarified butter with 'thou art ajya, thou art truth ...... may I partake of thee' (a long mantra from Tai. S. I. 6. 1. 1-2). The adhvaryu purifies (performs utpavana of) the ajya thrice with two pavitras 1348 the points of which are held towards the north by continuously carrying them backwards and forwards with thou art bright, thou art the flame, thou art light' (Tai. S. I. 1. 10. 3). He performs utpavana of the prokşapi water with 'devo vaḥ savitotpunātu &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 10, 3). The adhvaryu bills with the sruva ladle that has no trace of any. thing sticking to it and that is held in the right hand clarified butter inside the vedi, while holding the sruc together with the veda bunch in the left hand. The jubü ladle is 80 held that its bowl is alongside of the hollow of the ajya sthāll, that of the upabhrt is near the middle of the Ājyasthall and the dhruvā is on the ground. In the jubū and dhruvā four ladlings are made with Bruva while in the upabhst eight are made 1347, but the upabhit contains the smallest portion of ajya, the juhū contains a good deal and the dhruvi contains 

2346. The com. on Sat, 1. 7. p. 165 explains how this particular utpatana is done ' TrueTE TITTATYT som oftar go out 

mio portaera gothi'. The Rgvodins move the pavitras from the west to the east only. 

2347. There are various views about the number of times ajya is poured with the sruoa into tho three ladles ( srdo). Vide Ap. II. 7. 4-6, Sat, I. 7 pp. 166-167. The general rule is stated above.

the largest quantity. When the juhū is being filled the mantras are four sukram tvā...grhņāmi pañcānam tv....dbartrāya grhņāmi'(Tai, 8. I. 1. 10.3 and I. 6. 1. 2-3); in the case of the upabhịt the mantras are eight 'pañoānām tvartūnām... suviryāya tv....gphņāmi'; in the case of the dhruva the mantras are "suprajāstvāya tvā gļhņāmi ...... devatabhyo gpbņāmi' (Tai. 8. 1. 6. 1. 3). The yajamāna also invokes with the same mantras when the ladling is going on. The adhvaryu removes the ājyasthall together with the veda and sruva from the vedi, keeps the ajya in some place other than the utkara, invokes the prokşaŅl waters with the divine waters (āpo deyir &a, Tai, $. I. 1.5. 1) and geeks the permission of the brabma priest with 'brahman, shall I sprinkle.' When the brahma says 'yes' he sprinkles thrice the idhma (fire-wood brought, vide p.1014 above), the veda bunch and the vedi, each with a separate mantra ( from Tai. S. I. 1. 11. 1). He places the whole bundle of barhis with the knot to the east inside the vedi with a (sautra) mantra 'we had recourse to barbis &c.' and sprinkles the tips, the middle portions and the roots of the barhis respectively with * to thee for heaven', 'to thee for the aerial region', 'to thee for the earth.' While the sprinkling proceeds the yajamāna repeats & Verse may the waters and herbs be well disposed to the yajamāna &o.' (Ap. IV. 6.1). He dips the tips of the barhis in the water contained in the agnihotra-havani and then the roots also. He sprinkles over the knot of the barbis from east to west water from the sruo over which he places his hand ( 80 that water oozes over it from his finger tips ) with 'to you for nourishment' ( Tai. S. VII. 1. 11). He pours down the remain ing prokşapi water from the southern corner ( sroņi) of the west side of the vedi to its north corner with 'svadbā to the pitre, mayst thou be strength for the barhişad pitss, may you (the partioles of water ) go to the earth with strength and the yajamāna says this is for the Barhişad pitrs.' 

: Now comós barhirūstarana (strewing the vedi with kuša grass). He loosens the knot of the bundle of barhis with *may Püşan loosen thy knot'. He takes in his hand the pras tara bunoh drawing it towards the east slowly from the bundle of barbis (as if towards the abavaniya) with 'thou art the crest ( stapa) of vişnu i. e. yajña (Tai. S. I. 1. 11). With 'I implant prāna and apāna in the yajamāna' he places the two pavitra blades (used in utpavana above) on the prastara, hands it over to the brahmā priest, who passes it on to the

yajamāng who holds it in his hand. He strews darbha 484** grass on the vedi and places the cord that tied the barbis thereon with 'God Barbis! I strew thee that art soft like wool, as & good seat for the gods'. The darbhas are spread in three or five series (or divisions) beginning from the west side of the vedi towards the east (or the reverse according to some) in such a way that the tips of one set that is already spread cover the roots of the next and the grass is so thickly strewn that the ground below cannot be easily seen. When the kusa grass is being strewn the yajamāna recites a mantra 'O barhis, that are soft like wool, being spread ... ... place me in heaven &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7.6), when the vedi is covered with the middle division of the barhis he recites the mantra 'this young lady with four tufts of hair &c.' (Tai, Br, III. 7.6) and when the vedi is completely covered he recites & long passage 'May you be suspicious to me ......... increase food, strength, spiritual lustro, martial brilliance, prosperity, progeny, cattle for me &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7.6).' 

He takes out two blades ( to be used later) for the andyajas and keeps them separately to the east, feeds the ahavaniya with fire-wood, takes back the prastara from the hand of the yaja māna, and while holding the prastara himself places the three enoircling fuel-sticks (paridhi) round the āhavaniya fire. The middle paridhi is placed on darbhas to the west of the abavaniya with the tip towards the north with 8348 thou art gandharva &o.'. While the middle paridhi is being placed the yajamāna recites a mantra ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The other two paridhis are laid to the south and north of the abayanlya place with their tips to the east, the southern one extending a little beyond the abavaniya place and touching the middle paridhi and the northern one also touches the middle paridhi. The yajamāna repeats two long passages when the southern and northern paridhis are being laid (portions of which are identioal

with that repeated by the yajamina for the middle paridhi). The adhvaryu invokes the dhavaniya 'may the sun guard you against all injuries whatever' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 11). He places (in the midst of the āhavaniya fire) two samidhs with their ends turned upwards on which the agbāras ( will be offered later on), one to the south with the mantra 'O Fire, the wise one, may we kindle thee &o.'(vitihotram trā kave &o. Rg. V. 26. 3 or Tai. 8. I. 1. 11) and the other to the north of it silently. From the midst of the barhis he takes two darbhas of equal length, that have no blade hhooting from inside of them; these are called vidbști and are laid down on the barbis strewn on the vedi in the middle portion of the latter with their tips turned northwards with 'you two are the regulators of people'. When the vidbftis are being laid down the yajamāna repeats a long passage 'I cut off my enemies with the vidhịtis......may you support life, progeny and cattle in me' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6) The adhvaryu keeps the prastara bunch on these two vidhftis with 'sit in this abode of Vasus, Rudras and Adityas' (Tsi. 8. I. 1. 11) and the yajamāna repeats a mantra 'this prastara is the support of both Prayājas and Anāyājas &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7.6). The adhvaryu places the jubū on the prastara in such a way that its rod will be alongside of the roots of the prastara bunch with a mantra, 3349 The upabhrt is placed to the north of the juhū in such a way that its root is very much to the West of the root of the juhū and it is underneath the vidhtis, and the dbrupā is placed to the north of the upabbţt over the vidhftis and its root is very much to the west of that of the upabhrt. The three should not be so placed as to touch each other. The yajamāna repeats three passages (all from Tai. Br. III 7. 6) addressed to the three ladles when they are being placed. The adhvaryu lays down the sruya to the south of the jubü (or to the north of the dhruvā but a little behind its bowl) with 'thou art a bull possessed of strength, I seat thee in the extent of vaşatkāra'. He places the ajyasthall also in suoh a spot as space would permit. The yajamina repeats & mantra for sruva and another for ajyasthall (Tai. Br, III, 7. 6). The adhvaryu invokes the ladles (srucs ) with these sat in the world of good deeds; 0 Vişnul protect them, protect the sacrifice

and the lord of sacrifice and me who bring sacrifice (Tai. 8. I. 1. 11, Vāj. 8. II. 6). He invokes the clarified butter with you are all-pervading, belong to Vişnu and are the abodes of Prajapati'. He takes in his hand the djyasthali together with the aruva and the Veda bunch, removes with the veda bunch the burning coals from the southern. purodāsa with 'Here do I remove the mouth from the attacking army' and tben removes them also from the northern purodaśa. He invokes the purodala with 'O Sun, O Light, shine forth for great vigour.' He spreads a little clarified butter in the puro dāšapātri for each of the two oakes with 'I make a happy seat for you, I arrange for a seat full of pleasure with a stream of butter' (Tai, Br. III. 7.5 ) and drops Olarified butter over (1. e. performs abhighārana ) the southern purodaša which is intended for Agni with 'May Agni whose source is ghee increase (or be pleased ), may ho accept the offerings, anoint the holes, anoint the skin; I sprinkle thee that art good looking, that art dear to Agni and that securest wealth with the lustre of cattle ( i. e. ghee ) for Agni' (Tai. Br. III. 7.5) and drops butter silently on the northern purodaśa. If the second offering be sānnayya (instead of a purodasa ) he drops clarified butter over the boiled milk with a mantra May that self of yours that has entered cattle...go to the gods and secure heaven for me who am a Bacrificer'( Tai. Br. III. 7.5). He removes the purodāsa into the pātri ( veggel ) from the potsherds without allowing it to break up into pieces and without making it roll about with this baked ( puroờasa ) that is moist and has broad prominences, that is the protector of the world, that is the generator of 

· thoughts (or prayers ) comes out for a bath' (Tai. Br. III. 7.5). He brushes away the ashes ( sticking on the back of the puro dasa ) with the veda bunch and lays it down in the purodaśa pātri on the butter that has already been sprinkled over it with * Sit on that, be firmly placed in neotar, O offering, that art the essence of rice grains,"150 with a favourable mind' (Tai. Br. III. 7.5). He sprinkles clarified butter over it a second time and keeps it aside with 'mayst thou be strong, 

He sprinkles clarified butter over each of the potsherds ( on which the purodaša was baked), counts them and keeps them aside with may not prosperity in the form of food and the flavour of earth pass away. (Tai Br. III. 7.5). He anoints

both the purodd as with butter with 'may god Savity anoint thee with honey' (the mantra is repeated twice ), the upper part being anointed by the sruva ladle with plenty of ghee in such a way that there are no mere drops of ghee on it as there are specks on the back of the tortoise ( but the ghoe is well spread over the whole surface ) and that the lower skin of the purodāsa is anointed with ghee by the right band. He lays down the two purodāsas to the west of the srucs, that for Agni being to the south and the other being to the north with 'may you occupy this loved seat by your lovable lustre.' If sānnayya is to be offered, he bridgs together (makes them touch each other) in the middle of the vedi the two jars of it and then keeps them separate, the one containing the boiled milk on the southern corner of the west side of the vedi and that containing ourds on the northern corner thereof. When the sānnayya is being thus placed the yajamāna repeats a verse 'yasta &tma' &o.' (Tai. Br, III. 7. 5) and repeats & mantra (from Tai. Br. III. 7. 6) invoking the purodāsa for Agni, that for Agnisoma ( or Indra and Agni), the hot milk, the curds (the sānnayya in casos where it is offered ). 

The adhvaryu lays down the Veda bunch in front of the dhruva ladle with this veda sought the earth that was con cealed &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6), strews darbhas round the corners of the vedi, 8381 and prepares the seat for the hotr which is to the north of the northern froņi' of the vedi and the darbhas spread on the seat have their points turned eastwards or northwards. The adhvaryu invites the hots in the words 'O Hotrl come'. The hotę priest sits down to the north east of the dhavaniya with face to the east, performs ācamana with the sacred cord in the upavita form, enters the sacrificial ground (vibāra) by the way called tirtha (vide p. 984 above). He enters with his right foot first, plants his heel alongside of the northern sroni and steps upon the barhis ( spread on the vedi) with his toon, spreads out the fingers of both hands which be joins together and holds them on a level with his heart, lookg straight at the horizon (and neither upwards nor downwards) and stands facing the east. This is always the position of the limbs of the body in the case of the hot; unless there be any express direction to the contrary. The adhvaryu takes a samidh from the idhma and issues a direction to the hotr recite

So saying he contracts his fingers towards himself and then extends them as before by saying 'O fire! make the cattle take delight in mo'. (Then he should proceed ) 'Heaven and earth are my armour. Fire is my armour, the Sun is my armour and may the intermediate quarters be my armour! 0 gods! I shall to-day reflect over that highest part of speech, whereby we may vanquish the asuras; O five people, who deserve sacrifices and food accept my offering.1352 Having finished this japa, the hot; sets about repeating the Samidheni verses.8853 The yajamāna repeats the daśa-hotę mantras before the simidhenis (vide note 2247 for daśahotrs). First he utters the syllable 'him' thrice (or once ) and the mystic words 'bhūr bhuva” svarom' are muttered inaudibly by him.2884 Then come the sāmidheni Verses. The sāmidheni verses are (vide Ašv.

The syllable 'om is to be added at the end of each verse and the adhvaryu sitting down near the ahavenlys throws into the ahavaniya fire & samidh the moment 'omis uttered by the hots at the end of a verse.

In the case of a kşatriya or a vaibya seorificer, the invocation is monde of the pravare sages of the purobita of the sacrificer or of the names "Māneva, Aila, Paurūravaga' or of 'Manava' for all in case of doubt (Asv. I. 3. 3-5). He then proceeds

For example, if the gotra of the sacrificer is $andilya the botp reports $aņờila, Asita, Devala; if it be Vatsa, he repeats Bhargava, Cytrana, Apgavāna, Aurva, Jāmadagaya. Agai is bere invoked to help the sacrificer as the summoner of the gods on this occasion, as he did help the illustrious ancestors of the sacrificer. Vide Haug's tr. of Ait.

Having thus invoked the deities ( i. e. the whole of the invocation up to this is done standing ), the hotp sits down with knees raised up, removes the kusa (on the vedi) to its north and measures the space of a span on the vedi with Aditi is his mother, do not cut him off from the air,......with yajña, with vaşatkāra as the thunderbolt I kill him who hates us and whom we hate'( Ašv.

of clarified butter on the fire bursting into flames in the dhava niya place towards the south-east and makes all the fuel-sticks (already thrown over the fire ) como in contact with ( the butter so poured). The yajamāna says 'this is for Prajāpati' and invokes the butter poured as āghārs with thou art the mind of Prajāpati, enter into me with mind.' Taking ajya from the ājyasthali in the sruva he strengthens ( or inoreages or adds to) the dhruvā with 'let the dhruvā be strengthened with ghee &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 6.5. 1). He then issues a direction to the āgnidbra 'O Agnidhra, clean thrice each of the paridhis and the fire.' The agnidhra holds the tying cords of the idma on the sphyx and silently cleans (or wipes ) the paridhis with them in the order in wbich they were placed (round the fire ) from their roots to the tips i, e. he cleans the middle one first, moving with his right towards the paridhi from the north with his face towards the east; then he cleans the southern one by going to the south in front of the abavaniya ; then he oleans the northern paridhi by going from behind ( the west of) the āhavaniya towards the north; then he returns by the way he went to his usual place and wipes the fire thrice, once with the mantra, 'O fire, that securest strength (or food)! I wipe thee......that eatest food for the sake of food' (Tai, Br. III. 7.6) and twice silently. When about to make the āghāra he folds his hands in adoration to the gods with his fingers to the east in front (i. e. to the east of ) tho juhū and upabbst with3361 O fire I thou art the world, spread in all directions; O sacrificer (Agni), adoration to thee'( Tai. 8. I. 1. 12. 1). He folds his hands towards the south in adora tion with to the pitrs, svadba.' He then touches water and takes up the juhũ in the right hand with 'O jubül come, Agni summons thee for the worship of the gods' and takes the upabhst in the left hand with 'O upabhrtl come, god Savitr calls thee for the worship of gods' (Tai. S. I. 1. 12. 1). He places the upabhșt on juhů with 'O well-controlling ones, may you two abound in ghee to day for me, may you be well covered and well surrounded' ( compare Vaj. S. II. 7). He takes the juhů from under the upabhţt to the east completely and holds it on the upabhrt in such a way that their bowls are placed on each other and when he is about to throw the ajya into fire he merely holds the upabbst in his left and holding the juhü in his right

makes the offering with it. 436 He crosses over to the south of the ahavaniya with the right foot but without treading upon the prastara and after repeating the mantra 'O Agni and Vişnu! May I not step down on you! May you become apart from me: May you not cause trouble ( or heat) to me; may you, who are the makers of worlds, make a place (or world) for me' (Tai. S. I. 1. 12 and Tai. Br. III. 3.7). He stands to the south of the ahavaniya with thou art the seat of Vispu; from here Indra performed his exploits ( Tai. 8. I. 1. 1%). He places his right foot inside the vedi and makes the toes of the left foot touch the heel of the right. Then inserting the juhů by the point where the southern paridbi joins the middle one (i. e. from the south-west) he, while standing, pours from it towards the north-east (as in the first ) & continuous stream of Ājya with 'having well begun, the sacrifice of the sacrificer, which is to rise ( i. e. to bring prosperity ), which is uninjured and which is offered to Indra, touches heaven; svāhā' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 12 ) and makes the ghee come in contact with all the fuel-sticks (idhma) thrown into tbe fire. The yajamāna says 'this is for Indra.' The adhvaryu, after making this offering (the 2nd aghāra), lets out his breath which he had held up at the time of making the offering. After pouring ājya over the fire he raises up the juhū over the abavaniya with '( fire ) is kindled pre-eminently.' He crosses over to the north separating the juhū and upabhst with 'save me, O fire, from evil (or sin) and establish me in good deeds' (Tal. S. I. 1. 12). With the djya in the juhũ he smears the dhruya thrice, once with ghee is anointed by fire, sacri ficial offering is anointed by sacrificial offering, the aerial regions are anointed by fire-flame' and twice silently. He takes ajya from the dbruvi ladle with the sruva and sprin kles it over 2364 the (ajya in the ) jubū with 'suviraya svāha' and sprinkles ajya from the juhü over that in the dhruvā with 'sacrifice is spread continuously by sacrifice'. 

2362. Ap. (11. 13. 6-6) and Sat. (II. 1. pp. 181-182) say that this is tho mode of holding the two ladles in all abutis (ho also holds the two on a lovel with his navel).

then in PU fan 4.23 

After keeping the two ladles (juhū and dhruva) in their proper places, he (the adhvaryu) sets about choosing (invoking) the pravara. The adhvaryu brings in contact with (twines round) the sphya the tying cords of the idhma and one blade from the the kušas strewn on the vedi and stands to the north of the yedi (or near the utkara ) for reciting the pravara mantra. He faces the south (the east according to com. on Kat. III. 2. 3). The agoldhra stands to the west of the adbvaryu faoing the south near the utkara. The adhvaryu then inaudibly utters & formula 'who will become the adhva ryu here? He will become the adhvaryu here. Yajna ( will be adhvaryu) of yajña, I stand in the abode of Vispu. May speech perform the function of & priest, may mind do 80, I resort to speech. Bhūḥ bhuvaḥ suvaḥ l' (Ap. II. 15. 1 and Sat. II. 1. p. 186). The āgnidhra after touching the binding cords of idma, the sphya and the kuša blade also inaudibly repeats a similar mantra 'who will become the āgnidhra here &o.' (Ap. II. 15. 2). The adhvaryu addresses the brabmā priest 'O brahman I shall I call on (the agnidhra ) to listen to the pra vara ?' The brahmā priest first repeats inaudibly 'O lord of speeohl make (him) listen to this speech, make the sacrifice be heard among gods, and me among men (Ap. III. 19. 3); sustain these deities in heaven &c.' and then loudly says 'yes, do make him listen (omjāsrā3vaya). The adhvaryu says 2304 "a3 srāvaya' (make to listen) and the āgnidhra holding the sphya covered with the binding cord responds with 'astu srau3şat' (lit. yes, let him hear). The adbvaryu thed utters May Agni, the divine hots, the wise one, the discriminating one, sacrifice for the gods, like Manu, like Bharata, like that one, like that one. Let him bring the gods) to the accompaniment of holy prayer. The brahmanas are the protectors of this sacrifice. 

2364. The call of the adhvaryu in the form O dr&vaya' (for & ka vayı ) is tochnically called ' Adrivada' orsruta ', wbile tbe responso of the Igaldbra in the form 'astu drau3gat 'is called pratyadravapa 'or 

pratydruta'. Vido Sat. Br. I. 5. 2. 6-7 wbero, to explain those two worde, & legend is narrated of the sacrifice fiecing from the gods. The formula uttered by the adhvaryu is either s932139 or 133TT acoord ing to Bat. II. 1. p. 186 and acoording to Āp. II. 15. 3 it is also simply

This ( 80 and so by name) is the human hotr'. 1366 While the adhvaryu is engaged in the asrāvana call the hotr should follow him with an invocation 'make the sacrifice heard among gods, and make me heard among men for fame, glory and spiritual eminence' (Ašv. 1. 3. 23). When the adhvaryu chooses the hotr (in the words 'so and so is the human hotr) the hotę should repeat 'God Savitil they here choose thee that art fire for the office of hotr together with thy father Vaisvānara. May Heaven and Earth protect me. Agni is the (divine) hots. I am the buman hots' (Agv, 1. 3. 23). He gets up with a mantra 'udāyuşā &c.' (Tai. 8. I. 2. 8. 1) and on getting up recites 'O adhvaryul sixty plus ninety chains are spread near (or inside ) Agni, the hots. They bind the ignorant, (but) the wise one goes beyond (overcomes) them' (Aøv. I. 3. 24). Having approa ched the adhvaryu with 'I, a hots priest, follow the path of Ita' (Asv. I. 3. 25 ) the hots should touch the adhvaryu on the latter's shoulder with his right hand that bangs by his side and the āgnidhra also with his left with 'we touch Indra as the purohita in this rite of choosing the hotệ, whereby the gods reached the highest Heaven and the Angirases algo did 80' ( Ašv. I. 3. 27). He should wipe ( purify ) his face thrice with the blades used in binding the idhma, once with thou art &

After touching water he should, standing to the west of the seat and with face to the east, address the seat of hotr (Ašv. I. 3, 30) with 'away, O daidhişavya &o.' (vide above p. 1021 ). He should take a blade of kusa from the hott's seat with the thumb and the finger next to the smallest and cast it away to the south-west with *the demon that keeps off wealth is cast aside.' With ( Ašv. 1 3.31 )'here do I like a horse sit down in the seat of vasu' ( wealth) he should sit down, the right leg being placed on the left one. He sits down with 'God barhis, may I sit down on thee that occupiest a good seat' (Ašv. I. 4.7). With the cap of his knee he touches the barhis (spread on his seat) with 'O Hot! May you pre-eminently occupy the barhis' (Ašv. 1. 4. 8). Then he mutters (performs japa of) certain texts viz: 'bhū pataye namah ......... chandāmsi prapadye' (Ašv. I. 4. 9), Rg. X. 158. 1, I. 27. 13, X. 52. 1, X. 53. 2 and 4. When the japa is finished and the fuel-sticks (idhma) thrown on to the fire are blazing he should make the adhvaryu hand over to him the two srucs with this prose formula (nigada) 'may Agni, the hots, know (undertake) the duty of hots, that gives protection. O sacrificer! The deity is well disposed to you in that you have chosen Agni as the botr'. He should finish the nigada (Ašv. I. 4. 11) 'Hold the adhvaryu's sruc that abounds in ghee, that is devoted to the gods and is possessed of all boons; let us praise the gods that deserve praise, let us bow to them that deserve adoration and offer sacrifice to the gods that deserve it! (Asy. I. 4. 11). 

The adhvaryu, when the hotę sits down, throws down on the vedi the blade of grass (that was brought in contact with the sphya). 2366 The yajamāna says 'O gods and pitrs, O pitrs and gods &c.'. The yajamāna should repeat the Caturhotr mantras before the prayājas are offered (vide note X248 ). 

The adhvaryu takes the juhů and upabhrt, crosses from behind the paridhis to the south of the vedi with the right foot first and faoing the north-east offers the five prayaja oblations of clarified butter beginning to the west of the place where the two streams of the aghāras meet and ending in the east (Ap. IL. 17.1) or he offers the five offerings in the four principal quarters from the east to the north respectively and the last in the middle of the ahavaniya (Sat. II. 2. p. 199). The procedura

of prayðjas is as follows \#267 First he says '£34rd3vaya', the āgnidhra standing near the utkars facing the south and holding the sphya makes the response 'astu þrau3şat'. Then the adhvaryu' gives a direction to the hots with reference to the first prayāja 'Samidho yaja' (recite the yājyā verge for the deity Samidhah ). The hotr recites “Whoever we are, we sacrifice to the deity gamidhaḥ; may the samidhs, O fire, par take of the ājya. Vau3şat". When the sound vaşat is heard the adhvaryu offers ajya from the juhū towards the eastern and the most blazing part of the ahavaniya fire. He may either occupy the same position or proceed eastwards as he offers each offering. Jai. III. 1. 19-20 deals with this question viz, that he may offer the prayājas 2388 by proceeding eastwards.

vaşatkāra the hot; repeats 'speech is energy. He (Vesatkara) is indeed energy. May prāņa and apāna be in me' ( Ašv. I. 5. 17). The yajamana says when the first prayāja is offered * this is for the Samidhs. I gratify Vaganta among the seasons, May he ( Vasanta ) being gratified gratify me'. The same procedure is followed as to the remaining four prayājas viz. there is first asravana, then pratyagrāvana by the āgnidhra, praişa to hotf, recital of the yāyā by the hotr with vaşa . kāra at end, offering of djya into fire by the adhvaryu, the tyaga by the yajamāna and connecting the five prayajas with the five ytus (seasons) in order from Vasanta ( hemanta and sisira being taken as one). The second prayāja offering is meant for Tanūnapat, but those who belong to the Vasiştha, Sunaka, Atri. Vadhryasya and Rajanya (Visvamitra?) gotras substitute Narā samsa for Tanûnapāt (Śān. I. 7. 3 is slightly different). The whole procedure is briefly indicated in Sanskrit in the note below.9369 The first three pray&ja offerings are made with the ajya in the juhū, but as to the 4th (to Barbis ) he pours half of the Ajya contained in the upabhrt into the juhū and then makes the offering. Wherever there are more prayājas than 5 (e. g. in Varuņa-praghasa there are nine, in Pasubandha ten) the 4th, 7th and 10th are offered in this way (vide Sat. II. 2. p. 199 and Kat. III. 2. 22-23). Vide Jai. IV. 1. 40 and 41-45. These mantras ( in the note ) occur in Tai. Br. III, 5, 5 where * viyantu' is substituted for 'vyantu' (as is usual with the Taittiriyas). The words ' ye3 yajāmahe used at the beginning of each yājyā are called 'agūḥ'; but there are no such words in the anuyājas ( Ašv. I. 5. 4). Vaşatkāra is uttered at the end of all ydjyds and in anuyājas also. The yajyā is pronounced very loudly and with great distinctness as to the 'ye' of *ye yajāmahe' and the last syllable of the yajya is made pluta. In Asv.

XI. 6 says that 'the vaşatkāra is a thunderbolt; when a man utters vaşatkārs he should think of his enemy; thereby he plants the thunderbolt on him.' Asv. I. 5. 18 states that vaşatkāra was to be uttered only by day and not by night. There are three topes (mandra madhyama and uttama). Up to the prayājas and after gamyu. Vaka the mandra tone is employed. After prayājas up to sviştakst the tone is to be madhyama. Thereafter up to samyuvāks it is to be bigh. Vide Ašv. I. 5. 25-28 and Ašv. I. 5. 4-8 for these and several other rules. Ašv. II. 15. 12 states that the agūḥ (the words ye3 yajāmahe ), the om ( at the end of an anuvākyā ) and the vaşatkāra are pronounced in a high tone everywhere. 

The adhvaryu after the five prayāja offerings comes back and pours some ājya7370 ( left in the jubû after the prayāja offer inga ) over the several offerings ( haviñşi), first over the dhruvā, then over the purodāsas, the boiled milk, the ourds in the order in which they are sacrificed later on. Lastly be pours a little ajya over the upabhịt. He lays down the ladles (sruo). He holds thein in his hands from the time when he offers the djyabhāgas up till the offering to Agni Sviştakst. He puts into the juhū four ladlings of ajya with the sruva with 'may the dhruva be strengthened with ghee in each sacrifice for those who serve the gods &o. (Tai. 8. I. 6. 5. 1) and anoints the blades of the prastara with a drop of Ziya.

Then there is āśrāvana by adhvaryu and pratyāśrāvana by āgoldbra, then the praisa of adhvaryu to the hotę to repeat the yajya for Agni.

On hearing vauşat' the adhvaryu offers ajya in the northern and most blazing part of the Dhavaniya. The yajamāna recites * Agni has his eye ( everywhere ). May I become possessed of sight by worship offered to him. ' The same procedure is follow ed as to the second ajyabhāga to Soma which is offered in the southern and most blazing part of the ahavaniya fire. In pūrņa māsa the two djyabhagas are called Vārtraghna and in the dardeşti they are called 'Vğdhanvantau '( Āøv, I. 5, 32 and 35 ). Vide Jai. III. 1. 23. The adhvaryu is on the north side of the vedi when he takes up portions of ājya in the juhū and issues the direction to recite the anuvākyā from there. Then he crosses to the south of the Ahavaniya, performs ātrā vapa and issues the praişa for the recital of the yājyā after the agnidhra responds with 'astu srau3şat.' The whole procedure is briefly set out in the note below.m 

Puronuvakya and Yājya are required in djyabhāgas, in avapa, in Sviştakst and in Patnisamyājas, but in prayājas and anuyājas there are only yajyas (vide Sat. II. 2. p. 189). The puronuvakya is recited by the priest while sitting, while the yājvā is recited standing and the recitation of these is only a samskāra and not a principal act (vide Jai.x.4.39-41), Four ladlings with sruva are made in the juhū for all sacrificers in ajyabhāgas and other homes, but in the case of sacrificers whose gotra is Jāmadagnya five (pañcāvatta) ladlings are made in the juhü (Ap. II. 18.2, Sat. II.2 pp. 190-191) and one whose gotra is not Jāmadagnya may have five ladlings after taking the permission of a Jāmadagnya. The puronuvākyās for the ajyabhāgas in darsesti are Rg. VIII 44.12 (for Agni) and Rg. I. 91. 11 (for Soma).

The adh varyu having gone across (towards the purodābas that are made ready) sprinkles clarified butter on the sruo (juhū) with 'āpyāyatām dhruvā &o.' ( vide p. 1059 above), touobes the several sacrificial offerings with 'do not be afraid, do not tremble, may I not injure thee; may not thy lustre leave thee; carry across this sacrificer who brings offerings, rain on the earth, in order I shall offer the cut portions; I make an adoration to you, do not injure me' (Tai. Br. III. 7.5), 8373 With his thumb and two fingers (viz. the middle and anamika, but using only the fleshy parts and not the nails) he cuts off & portion from the middle of the purodāsa ( oake) meant for Agni and from its front half. Sat. II. 2. p. 191 and Āp. II. 18. 9 say that the avadāna (portion out or severed) is as much as the front joint of the thumb (as a general rule) but that the sviştakst offering is larger than the ordinary offering for other deities 837* &c. For the Jāma dagayag a third portion is cut off from the hind part of the purodāsa. Portions from ajya and sānnayya are taken out with the sruva and of cooked food (caru) with the mekşaņa. The por tion cut from the middle is placed in the eastern part of the bowl of the srud and the second portion in the western part of the bowl. He sprinkles clarified butter with the sruva (in which ajya is taken from the ājyasthall) on the out portions and on the purodāsa from which they were cut €375 with when cutt ing portions from thee I acted against thee, I anoint that again with ajya, may that grow again in thee' (Tai. Br, III. 7.5). Everytime he offers a fourfold (caturavatta) portion he smears & drop of djya on the blades of the prastara. 

Then follows the principal gaorifice. The adhvaryu issues a direction to the hot; 'recite an anuvākyā for Agoi'. Hotr recites ( as anuvākya) Rg. VIII. 44. 16 followed by 'om' (as

X. 8. 6 ( yes yajāma. hesgnim bhuvo......havyavāho3m vau3şat ). Then the adhva ryu throws the oblation (Ahuti ) of purodada portions on to the fire. The method of this is 1978 that he drops a part of the Ajya from the sruo first (that was sprinkled in it at upastarana and abhigh.rana ), then the two purodaśa portions are thrown and lastly he allows the remaining ajya from the bill-like mouth of the sruo to flow over the purodāsa offerings as if covering them but without disturbing them. The principal āhutis are introduced at the point of the confluence of the two āghāras and each one is offered in the Ahavaniya to the east (or north-east) of the preceding one but in contact with the latter. The yajamāna makes the tyāga 'this is for Agai' with 'may I have food to eat on account of this worship of Agni.' After this offering of purodaśa to Agni, there is an upāmsuyāja (a silent sacrifice ) with clarified butter offered to Prajāpati or to Agnişomau or Vişnu. When offered to Prajapati the anuvākya and yajyā are Rg. X. 121. 10 and Tai, Br. II. 8. 1 *377 (taveme loka &c.) and when offered to Agnişomau they are Rg. I. 93.2 and 6. According to Āp. I. 19.12 and Jai. X. 8. 51-61 it is offered only on Paurņamāsl. In this, the reference to the deity is always inaudible, but even here the asruta, the pratyāśruta, and two directions for reciting anuvakya and yājpā and the vaşatkāra are uttered loudly. The sacri ficer says in this upāmṇuy&ja 'thou art a destroyer; may I be uninjured and may I subdue evil. The offering is made of the ajya in the dhruva (Jai. X. 8. 47-48) and the devata is either Prajapati or Agni or Vişnu (Jai. X. 8. 49-50 ) and the offering is caturavatta (Jai. X. 8. 33-34). The second purodāsa is offered to Agni and Soma on pūrņamāsa in the same way, the anuvākyā and yajya being respectively Rs.

After the principal offerings comes the offering to Agni Sviştakst.1879 He sprinkles a little ājya in the sruo, cuts off one portion from each of the several remnants of the havis from their northern halves in the order in which the several saorifi cial ingredients are offered to the deities (twice in the case of pañoāvāttins), sprinkles over these cut portions olarified butter twice, but does not aprinkle ajya on the remnants of havis and offers them in a spot in the north-east of the fire but not 80 as to come in contact with the other abutis already offered (viz. djyabhāgas and purodāsa). In this also there is the direction to repeat apuvākyā, recital of anuvākya, āśrāpaņa, pratyāśrāvana, direction for yājya, the yājpā itself and vaşatkāra. The anu vakya for Sviştakrt offering is Rg.

VI. 4. 3 lays down that if after portions are out for Sviştakit as directed they are destroyed accidentally, there is no fresh outting for Svistakřt again. 

The adhvaryu comes back to the north of the vedi from the spot where he offered to Sviştakst, fills the juhū with water and pours it round the paridhis (or their places) beginning from the middle one and proceeding from left to right with 'I offer this offering into Vaišvānara, it is a spring with a hundred or a thousand streams. May he support in this that is being filled, my father, grandfather and great-grandfather' (Tai. A, VI. 6 ) and then touobes water. The sacrifioer makes the tyaga with 'this is for (my) father &c.' and then touches water. The adhvaryu lays down the two sruos in their proper places. Then he tears the surface (or top) of the purodāsa meant for Agni from west to east, inserts his thumb and the anāmika (ring finger) and takes out from inside the cake a portion which is as much as a barley grain or the pippala 8381 berry with 'let this be cut off, somewhat bigger than a barley grain or than the wound made by an arrow. May we not injure this boly and well-offered havis of the sacrifice' (Tal. Br. III. 7.5). He takes off a portion from the other purodāsa also in the same way but without piercing the top. These portions are called prasitrs. The brabma priest looks at the prasitra when it is being taken out with 'I look at thee with the eye of Mitra' (Aøv, I. 13. 1). The adhvaryu sprinkles clarified butter on the vessel called prašitrabarana (that in which prasitra is carried ), keeps the prašitra in it and sprinkles ajya over it ( does abhighāraņa ), takes it to the east of the ahavaniya by the space between the brahmā and yajamāna on one hand and the dhavaniya on the other and then lays it down to the west

The adhvaryu then sprinkles ajya in the idāpātra, he cuts off the first portion of ida from the southern half of the purodāsa meant for Agni with 'from the southern half I out off (ida) seen by Manu, from whose foot ghee oozes, that is moved by Mitra and Varuna, that has a face in one direction only (in the south), without mixing it with others' 1382 (Tai. Br. III. 7. 5). From the eastern half of the same purodāsa he outs off a thin but long slice which is the portion of the yajamāna (according to Baud. I. 18 it is three or four angulas long ) and which is anointed (or smeared) with ajya and placed near the dhruvā (or to the east of the dhruva ) in some vessel on the barhis. Then he outs off a part from the portion of the cake that is between its southern and eastern parts. In the same way (i. e. repeating the Verse 'seen by Manu' &c.) he cuts off & portion as idā from the northern purodāśa and other things offered (such as. the boiled milk and ourds ). He then sprinkles ajya over the out portions and removes them towards the east on the vedi. He crosses to the south in front of the botę, site bebind the hots with his face to the east and anoints the front two joints of the fore-finger of the hotr with djya from the sruva, first the front joint and then the one next to it. The hotr wipes with the palm of the hand turned towards his chest the uppermost joint of the finger on the upper lip and the next joint on his lower lip with 'I partake of thee that art sacrificed by the lord of speech for food, for prāna' and 'I partake of thee that are offered by the lord of the mind for strength, for apana' respectively ( Ašv.

I. 6.3.1-2, 'Surūp8-varşa-varpa obiman...devān-apyetu ') and looks at the ida when it is being taken to the hotę. The hotr acoepts the idā (i. e. the vessel of ida ) in his joined hands, places the idā in his left hand, keepa his right hand near the idā to its west with the fingers turned northwards and makes the adhvaryu out off from the idā itself & portion oalled avāntareda into the right hand in the following mander. The adhvaryu spreads drops of ajys on the right hand of the hotę with the sruva in which are poured the remnants of the djya in the idāpātra, then the adhvaryu takes & portion from the idāpātra and drops it on to the right hand and the hot; himself outs & second portion from the middle of the idā with the space between his thumb and the fore-finger; then the adhvaryu sprinkles over the idā in the right hand of the hots ājys as above, 1888 The hotf grasps the two portions with the thumb of his right hand, draws in the fingers of the right hand, but (keep ing the thumb outside ) does not close them into a fist, takes into his right hand the ida placed in his left. He (the hots) raises the idā on a level with his mouth or nose and invokes it. 

The idopahvanam or ifopa-invocation of the ida ) is desoribed at length by Aśv. I. 7.7.1884 By this invocation it is supposed that the deity Ida becomes favourable to the sacrificer. It is a niguda, but a large part of it is said inaudibly (up to

'Idā has been invoked with the Heaven, with the great Aditya; may idā together with Heaven and the great Aditya call us near' In the portion that is loudly uttered, there are three pauses, viz.after'idopahūta,' after 'manuşyāḥ' and after * devi dovaputro'.

When the invocation of idā is finished, he repeats * may Indra put in us vigour &c.'. When the words the divine adhvaryus 'are uttered, the adhvaryu mutters 'May I be endowed with cattle.' 

When the invooation of Idā is finished the adhvaryu passes round the āhavaniya towards its east and takes the prābitra to the brahmā priest and hands it over to him, Asv. I. 13. 2 des. oribes in detail what thereon the brabmā does. He looks at the prāśitra when it is being brought with 'I look at thee with the eye of Mitra.' He receives the prašitra in his joined hande with I accept thee at the impulse of god Bavit......with the hands of Pūşan.' He lays down the vessel containing prāšitra to the west of the dhavaniya inside the vedi on kusa grass, with its rod to the east,' I place thee in the navel of the earth, in the lap of Aditi.' He takes the prābitra with the thumb and the ring-finger and eats without masticating it with the teeth with "I eat thee with the mouth of Agni, with the mouth of Bphaspati.' Then he performs acamana and again drinks water with 'I sprinkle truth over thee; may the deities that dwell inside waters avert ( the evil in ) this. Do not injure iny eye, my ear, my life.' He should touch bis navel with 'I hold thee in the belly of Indra,' Then he washes the vessol in which prasitra was contained, fills it with water, pours. water thrice from it holding the vessel and the palm of the band towards one's chest.

After eating ida they observe silence till they perform mārjana. They perform mārja na tist Inside the vedi near the prastara bunch with 'May mind resort to light. May all gode regale themselves here' (Tal. S. 1. 5. 3. 2). 

The adhvaryu divides the purodass baked for Agni into four parts (and no other purodāsa nor sānnāyya) by piercing its surface and keeps it on the barhis (kušas strewn on the vedi), the last part being made the biggest of all four. Vide Jal. III.1.26-27. The yajamāna recites a mantra 'bradhna pinvasya &c.'( Tai. Br. III.7.5) and directs the four parts of that purodāsa separately as portions of the priests by saying 'this is for brahma, this for hotę, this for adhvaryu, this for Agnidhra' beginning in order from the south-east. The adhvaryu points out the portion of the yajamāna ( vide p. 1065 above). When that is done, the adhvaryu makes the biggest of the four parts which is meant for the agnidbra 'sadavatta '(out sixfold). 3888 The agnidbra eats his portion with thou art the portion of heaven, thou art the āgnidhra of fire, thou art the samitra of fire, I eat thee with the mouth of fire, salutation to thee! Do not injure me.' The adhvaryu brings the portions of brahmā and yajamāna where they are sitting in separate vessels with the veda bunch. The portions of the hots and adhvaryu are brought by the adhvaryu in other vessels. The adhvaryu, hots and brahmā eat their portions respectively with thou art the portion of the aerial region,' 'thou art....., of the earth,' 'thou......of heaven. "*388

The conolusion of Jaimini ( III, 4. 48-50) is that these portions are pot meant as the fee paid to the priests ( parikraya ), but the four parts are meant to be eaten by them, 

Plenty of rice is cooked on the dakşiņa fire. This is called anvāhārya. The adhvaryu sprinkles ajya over 1390 it (i. e. performs abbighārapa ) and takes it from the dakşiņa fire to the north of it. He issues & direction to the yajamāna 'offer (the boiled rice ) to the priests that sit to the south' and when the sacrificer says 'come to the south' the priests do as requested ( i. e. come to the south). The yajamāns issues a direction to the four priests 'this boiled rice is yours, take it according to your shares'. The rice is divided into four parts and the priests accept their respective portions with 'I accept thee at the impulse of God Savitr ......... with the hands of Püşan; may king Varuna take you. Who gave to whom? Desire ( Kama) bas given to Kāmna ...... O Kāma, this is thy fee. May Angsrasa with upturned palm accept it' (the whole formula occurs in Ap. XIV. 11.2).2391 The priests come back to the north (and then brahmā comes to his usual seat). The adhvaryu keeps aside the remnants of the several offerings (such as the agnişomlya oako or sānnayya ) and of the boiled rice outside the vedi to its north. 

He throws into the Abavaniya the two blades that are now kindled at the fire and had been kept aside (vide p. 1040 above). The adhvaryu says to the brahmā priest 'O brahmanl we shall start or commence (Tai. 8. II. 6. 9. 1). The brahmā priest first mutters 'Bșhaspati is Brahmā, he sat in the seat of Brahmā; O Bphaspatil you protected the sacrifice; protect the sacrifice and me' ( Asv. I. 13. 6) and loudly gives permission 'yes, do start ( 03m pratiştha ). The adhvaryu directs the āgnidhra 'O agost, take the samidh (that is left) and wipe the paridhis and fire, eace once'The āgnidhra takes the samidh and offers it into fire with the mantra 'O fire, this is

thy samidh; 13 may you increase and be strengthened by it. May the lord of the sacrifice (the yajamāna ) increase and be strengthened; syaha' (Sat. II. 4. p. 212 ). The yajamāna says as usual 'agnaya idam' and repeats 'O fire, this is thy samidh &c.' (Ap. III. 4. 6) and implores Agni to vanquish and destroy bis enemies (the lengthy formula is in Ap. IV.11.5). He (the agnidhra ) without moving about wipes the paridbis as before with the tying cords of idhma ( but without holding the sphya), the middle one from south to north and the other two from west to east, and wipes the fire also from west to east with 'O fire, that securest food &o.' (Ap. III. 4.7 gives the whole). He sprinkles water over the tying cords ( with which wiping was done ) and throws them into the ābavaniya with * do not injure our cattle, (you ) who are Rudra, the lord of beings &o.' ( Sat. II. 3. p. 213). The yajamāna makes the tyaga 'this is for Rudra, the lord of beings, who moves among rows (of Maruta ). 

The yajamāna touches water and mutters a mantra (which is in Ap. IV. 11. 6. vedirbarhiḥ &c.). The yajamāna also performs japa of the Saptahoir 1893 formulas before the anuyajas are offered. The adhvaryu takes into the juhữ the djya from the upabbột (leaving some in the latter), crosses over to the south with the juhū and sets about offering the three anupājas. First there is the agravana (03srāāvaya ), then pratyagravana (astu srau 3şat) by āgnidbra who always holds the sphyx when saying this. Then the adhvaryu issues a direction to the hot' recite the yājya for the devas.' When the hots recites the ydjyd and utters vau3şat the adhvaryu standing in one place offers the first djya offering on the samidh ( offered for anuyajas as stated on 1069 above ) to its east, the 2nd and 3rd to the west on the samidh itself (but all three are offered to 

2392. It is interesting to see that according to Kat. III. 6. 2-3 the mantra 'this is thy samidb' (Vaj. 8. II. 14) is recited by the hot; and if be be ignorant then by tbo yajan1na. This sbows that even thea priests igaorant of the work expected of them or at least igaorant of tho formulas they had to recito for & yajamina had sometimes to be oogaged. The Sat. Br.

In each case the yajamāna repeats the formula of tyāga. The yājyās and tyaga are given below in the note.*** The adhvaryu then comes back to the north, lays the two ladles ( sruo) in their proper places and he and the yajamāna mutter the two formulas (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. % called vajavati). The adhvaryu takes up in his right hand with palm upwards the juhů and prastara ( prastara being placed over the palm and jubû over the prastara ) with 'vājasya......grabbit (Tai, S. I. 6. 4. 2) and holds down (80 as to bring it in contact with bārbis ) with palm turned downwards in the left hand the upabbrt ladle (which is under the palm ) with 'athāsapatnān......akah' (ibid). He again takes up the juhū with 'udgrābham ca' (ibid) and presses down the upabbst with nigrābham ca.' At this time the juhū held in the right band is far apart from the upabbrt held in the left. Then he moves with the right hand having palm turned upward towards the east on the vedi itself the juhû with 'brahma dovā avivědhan.( the gods increased boly prayer ) and with the left hand having palm dowowards he leaves outside the vedi the upabbţt with ' atbāsapatnin... Vyasyatām' (ibid. 'Indra and Agni burled away my enemies' &o.). Then he touches water, sprinkles water over the upabhrt, takes it up and anoints with the butter remaining in the juhū the three paridhis, the middle one with to thee for Vasus,' the southern one with 'to thee for Rudras' and the northern one with "to thee for Adityas.' The yajamāna recites in each case 'this is for Vasus,' 'this is for Rudras,' 'this is for Adityas' followed in

each case with & prayer noted below.1885 After keeping the Jubũ in some spot on the vedi other than where the prastara is, the adhvaryu, baviog mixed the prastars with the two vidhịtis ( vide above p. 1045 ) with 'may heaven and earth be of the same mind; may Mitra and Varuņa help you with rain' he leaves the vidhrtis on the barbis and smears the prastara ( with the remnants of ajya ) in the three ledles ( sruc), the points in jubû with 'lioking the one that is smeared' (Tai. S. I. 1. 13. 1), middle portions in upabhrt with 'viyantu Tayab' (ibid) and the roots in dbruvā with 'prajām yonim '3894 (ibid). He does the anointing a second time ( with the same mantras ). He anoints a third time in the reverse order viz. the roots first in dhruva, the middle portions in upabbst and the tops last in juhū (the mantras being the same for each ladle ). The yajamāpa repeats, while the prastara is being anointed, a mantra may kusa be anointed with ghee (Ap. IV. 1%. 3). Taking out a blade from the prastara 80 anointed with 'to thee for long life', he places it in a kaown place (for use later on). When the blade is taken away from the prastara the yajamāna reoites a mantra ( apipred yajāo... yajamānam visantu ). 

The adhvaryu takes the prastara ( and also the sākha i. e. twig used at the time of milking cows when sānnayya is to be offered ), introduces the prastara (together with the twig) at the corner in the north where the middle and northern paridhis meet and says ' a3trāvaya.' When the dgnidbra responds with

May both heaven and earth save us from sin (or evil). May the most desirable thing come here. Here is adoration to the gods.' After the būktavāka the adhvaryu throws upon the ahavaniya the prastara (and the sakha, in case of sannayya) with 'alay waters and plants be strengthened; you are the

drops of Maruts ; go to heaven and send thence rain to us' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 1)." Jaimini makes it clear (VI. 4. 43-47 ) tbat sakbā is not a subordinate complement of the prastara but the real meaning of the text'he throws the prastara with the bakba' is to indicate the time when the sakha is to be thrown into fire. Jaimini (IV. 2. 10-13 ) states that the throwing of the gakba into fire is pratipattikarma ( i.e. that is the final disposal of the sākha ). When throwing the prastara he does not bend his hand but holds it rather straight and hanging downwards and the tips of the prastars are not put beyond the fire nor are they turned upwards, nor are the tips allowed to be first acorohed. He raises it up, brings it slowly down and rolls it on the hearth of the ahavaniya (making the upper portion come down and vice versa). The adhvaryu, when the hotf says 'this sacrificer seeks ( hopes for ) blessings' directs the agnidhra to consign the prastara to fire. The āgnidbra tbrice raises with bis joined hands the prastara into the &bavaniya fire. The sacrificer makes the tyāga to the several deities mentioned in the sūktavāka (agnaya idam, somāyedam &o.) and adds (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 1)'may I win victory following the victory of Agni' (then of Soma and so on for the other deities ). 1400 When the bots mentions the name of the sacrificer the latter recites "these blessings have come here' (Tai, 8. 1. 6. 4.% and Ap. IV. 12. 5). The adhvaryu directe the agnidhra to throw into fire on the prastara the blade of kuga taken from the prastara and kept aside ( as described above p. 107) and tbe āgnidbra 3401 does so with 'Good speed to the tanūs, svaha'. The yajamāna mutters 'this for the Tanüs' and proceeds 'This pillar spread down from beaven and was raised over the earth. With it that has a thousand shoots we worry our enemy etc. (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 and Ap. IV. 12. 8). The adhvaryu points out thrice with his forefinger the blade thrown into, fire with this, this' and touches his nose and eyes with * Agnil thou art the protector of life, protect my life, thou art the protector of eyes' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13.2). Then the adhvaryu touobes the earth inside the vedi with thou art stable'( idid).

The āgnidhra then addresses the adhvaryu 'talk with me'. The adhvaryu asks 'has (the prastara ) been consigned to flames'? The Agnidhra replies it has gone to the fire'. Tben after aśrāvana and pratyasrāvaņa the adhvaryu touching the middle enclosing stiok ( paridbi) issues a direction to the hotr 

Good speed to the divine hotrs ( here the paridhis ) and bliss to human hotf8. Recite for sam-yoh, 2408 Then the hot; recites the verge 'we long for that san-yoh, for (the) path to sacrifice and to the lord of sacrifice. May divine bliss be ours! May there be bliss for human beings. May the means (of bliss ) ascend upwards ! All bealth to the two-footed and the four footed that are ours' (i, e. to men and cattle ).03 When the Samyuvāka is repeated the yajamāna mutters may I attain stability by yajña, samyoḥ (health and wealth) by the worsbip of Vişnu' (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 3). The adhvaryu then throws into the fire the middle paridbi with 'O God Agni, that paridhi whloh you laid down ...... svāhā' (Tai. S. I. 1. 13. 2). 

The adhvaryu then pushes on to the burning coals of the ahavenlys the other two paridhis together (the southern and northern ones) with the food of saoriāce has come together.' He thrusts the tip of the northern paridbiunderneath the middle one in the burning coals and keeps the tip of the southern over the middle one. When the paridhis are being thrown on the fire the yajamāna mutters 'I loosen thy girdle &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 6. 4, 3). After the paridhis are thrown the adhvaryu invokes them 'may you spread (1. o. prolong the life of) the sacrificer'. 

The adhvaryu then lays on the bowl of the juhū the upabbft and lets flow from the two ladles the remnants of butter into fire with 'O Viśve Devas! You have for your sbare the remnants ( samsrāva ) of ajya...svāba' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 2). "404

Being about to perform the patnisamy.jus 4408 the adhvaryu passes to the south of the gārhapatya fire (from its east side) and the other two priests ( hotę and āgnidhra ) pass to its north. The adhvaryu places the two ladles on the sphyx with 'I place you in the abode of Agni whose house is indestructible; may you who are happy place me in happiness for the sake of happiness; may you who are the foremost (or leaders ) protect me. when I am in front' (Tai. S. I. 1. 13. 2-3). They sit to the west of the garbapatya and set about the offerings of Patpisamyājas with the two ladles in the dbvāna tone.

The offering to the wives of the gods may be made in an enclosed space (i. e. by placing a screen to the east of the gārbapatya ) so as to shut the gārhapalya from view on the eastern side. 5407 Additional offerings were allowed to be made to Rākā, Sinivāli and Kubü by those who desired song, cattle or prosperity respectively either before or after the offering to the wives of the gods. The procedure is briefly indicated in the note below, 8408 

The yajamāna makes a tyāga ( of the offering ) with this for Soma' (or for Tyaşt; and so on) and adds a separate for mula in each case invoking separate blessings of vigour, cattle, progeny and stability (vide Āp. IV. 13.1 and Tai. 8. 1. 6.4.3-4). The adhvaryu offers in the gārhapatya with the sruva an

oblation of djys with40'may the wife unite with her husband... svāba' (Tai. Br, Il. 7. 5 quoted on p. 556 n. 1291 ). The sacrificer's wife touches the adhvaryu ( with a blade of darbha) when he makes the last offering. The yajamāna makes the tyāga 'this is for the undecaying Great Soul, the light in Heaven.' 

The adhvaryu then smears the two front points of the hotr's finger as before, first the hind joint and then the front joint. He breathes over it and touches water. The adh varyu drops into the palm of the right hand of the hotf four drops of Ajya as ida "10 and six in that of the āgnidhra. The hotę inaudibly invokes both ( viz, his own ida and āgnidhra's, the hand of the latter being held underneath the former's ) in the same words as before (vide Appendix under note 2384). When the words 'this yajamāna has been summoned' are uttered, the wife mutters 'being summoned may I surpass in the possession "11 of cattle,' and the adhvaryu also performs japa as above. When the ida is being invoked the adhvaryu, the āgnidhra and the wife (with & darbha blade ) touch the hots. The yajamāna invokes ajya ida with 'may idā cover us with gbrta &o.' ( Ap. IV. 13. 4). At the end of the invocation of idā the hot; eata the ida ( drops of ajya ) and the āgnidbra eats his with 'father Heaven has been invoked, may the fire summon me from agni dhra for my life, lustre &c.' (Tai. Br. III. 7.6). He silently performs mārjana after partaking of idā. The patnisamyājas end with the invocation of idā or they may be inished after reciting Samyuvāka (Sat. II. 5, p. 225; Ašv. I. 10. 9; Kat. III. 7. 13). 

The adhvaryu sitting to the west of the dakşina fire places on it the chips cut from the idbma (idhma-prāvrasoana, vide above p. 1014) and offers two oblations called phalikarapa and pistalepa. $18 Having thrown into the ajya ladled into

Syaba' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13.3). When this homa is made the yajamāna rubs (wipes) bis mouth with 'svaba to thee, that art Sarasvati Yaśobhagina'(who loves laudation) and makes the tyaga with this is for Agni who has long life and not cool body' and wipes his face with 'svābā to thee, that art Sarasvati Vesabhagina' 2018 (who loves residing together, Ap. III. 10. 2). The adhvaryu takes again four ladlings of ajya with the Bruva into tbe juhů and pours therein the remnants of ground grains which still stick to the several utensils and offers them into the daksina fire with 'whatever stuck to the mortar, pestle and the winnowing basket... I Svābā'(Tai. Br. IIL 7, 6 and Ap. III. 

10.1). The yajamāna says 'this is for the All-Gods'. 

The botr hande over the veda bunch to the sacrificer's wife and makes her repeat aloud 'thou art vede... may I secure pro geny. To thee for Kāma'( Asv. I. 11. 1) and the sacrificer recites, when the veda bunch is being given to the wife'thou art Veda ...... may I secure gifts' (Tai. 8. I. 6. 6. 4) and when the veda is placed on her lap by the wife \#14 she repeats 'may veda give &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 6. 6. 4). The wife thrusts it with drive out the enemy, the hater' (Ap. III. 10.4). The wife touches her navel with the top of the veda bunoh if she desires progeny. 

The hotr unties the yoktra (the girdle) of the wife with 'I release thee from the fetter of Varuņa &o.' (Rg. X. 85. 24). *418 The wife lays aside the yoktra and the adhvaryu makes her recite 'here do I unloosen the fetters of Varuna &c.' (Tai. 8. I. 1. 10.2). The hotr winds round the yoktra twofold, places it to the west of the gārbapatya fire with its loop and end to the east, keeps over it the blades of the veda with their points to the north

The hotr touobes that vessel and makes the wife who touobes it repeat &'mantra 'thou art full &c.' (Tal. S. I. 6. 5.1). The bor sprinkles water from the pürnapātra in all directions and makes the wife, who also sprinkles water from it in all directions, repeat 'Let the gods and the priests purify (or wipe) in the eastern direction &o.' (Tai. S. I. 6. 5. 1-2, quoted in Asv. I. 11. 7). The hots places into the joined hands of the sacrificer's wife with the palm upwards the yoktra, and places his left hand with palm turned upwards on the wife's folded hands (but in modern practice the hots does not hold bis hand over the wife's ) and pours down tbe water from the pūrņapātra on the hands ( his and the wife's) and makes her repeat. May I not throw away progeny &o.' (Ašv. I. 11.8). The hots holds by his right hand the tops of the blades of the veda bunch (tbe binding cord of wbioh has already been unloosened), proceeds from the gārbe patya to the dhavaniya, repeats Rg.

Br. III. 7. 4). 

The adhvaryu come's back by the way he went, repeats 'may the dhruva be strengthened &o." (Tal. 8. I. 6.5. 1) and offers two ahutis of ajya to Sarasvati with the juhd into the ābavaniya with 'to thee, who are Sarasvati, called Yaśobhagina, svdhā' and with to thee Sarasvati called Vesabhaginā, svāna.' The yajamāna makes the tyāga in similar words. The adhvaryu again takes ājya in the juhū and offers an abuti to Indra with * Indropānasya kebamanaso vesān kuru sumanasaḥ sajātan' (Sat. II. 5. p. 230, Ap. III. 10. 2 ) 2420 and the yajamāna gays 

this is for Indra &o.' The adhvaryu offers an oblation of djya with sruva on the pürnamāsa isti with 'we offer worship to pūr pamāsa the foremost &c. svābā' (Tal. Br. III. 7. 5 quoted by Sat. II. 5 p. 230 ) and a similar oblation on darseşti witha "Amèrāsyā is fortunate and full of happiness &o. svaha.' The yajamāna makes tyāga. These are called pārvanahoma and according to some they are optionally performed before the offering to Sviştakrt. Jaimini ( IX. 2.51-56 ) establishes that these two homas are not performed in other iştis that are the modifications ( vikrti) of darśapūrņamāsa and in IX. 2. 57-58 establishes that both are not performed on pürpamāsesti and darbeşti, but the first homa (in which there is an oblation to pürpamāsa ) is alone performed on pürnamāseşti and the other on darsesti. The adhvaryu takes ajya six times with the mantra

The adhvaryu recites apyāyatām dhruva' (Tai. S. I. 6.5.1), takes ajya thirty-eight times and offers with the juhů oblations called sarvaprāgascittas to thirty-eight deities in the abavaniya with a mantra for each, 24&2 and there is an appropriate tyāga in each case. 

The adhvaryu repeats the mantra 'āpydyatam &c.' (Tai. S. I. 6.5. 1), increases the dhruva (with ajya ), stands erect Inside the vedi and offers with the druvā three homes called Samiętayajus 2433 in the āhavaniya with 'yo path-finding gods! after finding the path, return by it. O Lord of the mind 1 place this our sacrifice among the gods, in speech, in the wind (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 3). When the word svābā is repeated the second time he throws the barbis into the fire. The yajamāna says 'this is for the path-finding gods, for Yajña--for Para. mātman' and utters tbe invocation • agne adabdhāyo' (Tai. S. I. 1. 13. 3,) and after the barbis is thrown the verse 'divaḥ kbilo'(Tai. Br. III. 7.6). The yajamāna then eats his own share of the sacrificial food with 'let the lord of sacrifice be united with prayer &o.' (Tai, S. I. 3. 8. 1). 

But if it is the sānnāyya, he takes in the boiled milk with *May this havis, & giver of progeny, be for my welfare &c.' (Tai. Br. II. 6.3) and curds with 'dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39. 6). Āp. IV. 14. 2 notes that a yajamāna who is not a brābmana should not eat sānnayy&. The adhvaryu straws the vedi with 

2422. These 38 mantrus (some of them of single words like ipto bhyah staba, bhuh svtha) are set out in Sat. II. 6 pp. 232-234. Āp. (III. 11-12 ) contains most of thom, but in a differont order, 

2423. "Samiętayajus' would literally mean'a Yajus formula indi. cative of the completion of the sacrifice or of sacrificing together for many deities'. It now moans "an oblation'. The mantra is AT M78 पिदो मा विश्वा गातुमित मनसस्पत इमं नो देव देवेषु यज्ञ स्वाहा पापि स्वाहा पाते था। Tai, 8. 1. 1. 13. 3. There is a differonde of view about the Samiętayajus. According to Āp. III. 18. 2 (and com, ), Band. I. 21, Kat. III. 8. 4 the oblation is only one (made at the end of the whole mantra ), though the word svaba ocoars thrice (twice in the mantre itself and once repeated at the end of the mantra ). According to Sat. II. 6 pp. 234-285 the oblations are throo. Vide Vaj. . II. 11 for the mantra (slightly differont) and-sat. Br. I. 9. 2. 26-28 for its explanation.

the darbhas spread on the seat of the hotr with strew over the vedi &o. (Tai. Br. III. 7. 5). He carries the prapita waters from the eastern side with 'to you for prosperity' and pours them down inside the vedi with 'may he who joined you toge ther separate you'. The adh varyu pours on those pranita waters & continuous stream of water for the yajamāna who holds it in his joined hands and mutters 'thou art true, be true to me ...... do not perish for me' (sadasi ...... kşeşthaḥ' Tai, S. I. 6.5.1), throws up water in different directions with 'may gods and priests cleanse with water in the east &o.' ( Āsv. I. 11. 6-7), pours the rest inside the vedi with 'I dis charge you to the ocean, that is your origin' (Ap. IV, 14. 4) and wipes bis face with his wet right hand with 'O Sarasvati ! that honey which you have in waters &o.' (Tai. Br. II. 5. 8 quoted in Ap. IV. 14. 4). 

The adhvaryu then takes up the upaveşa and conceals it inside the dust of the utkara (vide Ap. III. 13. 6) and if it is desired to practise magic against one's enemy, then he throws the upaveşa on the utkara after taking the enemy's name (Ap. III. 14. 1, Sat. II. 6. p. 237 ). Vide Tai. Br. III. 3. 11 for the upaveşa and the mantras. The adhvaryu takes leave of the Yajñs with 'Let him who yokes you discharge you' (Tai. 8. 1. 5. 10.3 quoted in Sat. II. 6. p. 237) and passes his eye over the whole sacrificial ground.2424 Then he discharges the kapālas with the kapalas that were in the cauldron' (Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 3-4 quoted in Sat. II. 6. p. 237), counts them and keeps them aside. Then the adhyaryu goes out. The brahmā also places a fuel-stick on fire with the fire has been worshipped &o. ( Ap. III. 13. 1 and Sat. IL 8. p. 261 ) and then leaves by the way he came, 

The yajamāna gets up from his seat and takes what are called the strides of Vişnu' (vişnukrama ). 4435 These are four taken from the south corner (śroni) on the south side of the vedi. He starts towards the east putting the right foot always first, nover allows the left foot to come in front, does not go beyond the ābavaniya place and each succeeding step covers 

2424. According to com. on Sat. casting tho oye over the vih\#ra constitutes the discharge (vimoka ) of the yajña.

more ground than each preceding one. He first reoites four mantras 'thou art the stride of Vişņu &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 6. 5. 2 ) when taking the strides. Then he mutters & long prayer to the Sun 'O Light of Mitra rising to-day &c.' (Tai, Br. III. 7.6 and Tal. S. 1. 6. 6.1, quoted in Ap. IV. 15.1 and I. 16. 1). He contemplates the destruction of his enemy with the words. Here do I exclude from a share my enemy the evil.doer &o.' He revolves round himself from left to right with 'I turn the turning of Indra'( Tai, 8. I. 6. 6. 2) and goes round the abavaniya with 'Let me bave suspioious riches and may evil riches remain away from me' (Ap. IV. 15.4). He bends over the dhavaniya with 'thou art light' (Tai. 8. I. 1.10.3), pays homage to it with May I be united with my children and may my children be united with me &c.' (Tai, S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV, 15. 4). He puts the fire into flames 'O fire, being kindled, shine for me &o.' (Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV. 16. 5). He prays to the abavaniya with 'The sacrifice is endowed with riches, may I be endowed with riches &o.' (Tai. 8. 1. 6.6.2, Ap. IV. 15. 5.). He prays to the dakşiņa fire 'O fire, cook food pleasantly eaten for our progeny' (Ap. IV. 16. 5). He prays to the gārbapatya fire with the two verses to Agni Pavamāna (Rg. IX. 66. 19-20, Tai. S. I. 6.6.2), and with 'O Agni Gphapatil I am a good house-holder &o.' (Tai. 8. I. 6.6.3). If he has no son he prays 1436 "I pray for that blessing full of spiritual lustre for my son ( to be )' and if he has & son ho prays 'I pray for my son 8o and so that blessing &c.'( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 3). He sits between the two fires inside the vedi with 'to thee (unborn or born son as the case may be) who art light &c.' (Ap. IV. 16.6). He places on his lap the blades of the veda (that had been unloosened) and sitting inside the vedi mutters the Ati moksa mantras 'May Agni guard me against those gods that strike the sacrifice &o.' (Tai. S. III. 5. 4. 1-% indicated in Ap. IV. 14. 10). 

He then comes to his deat, looks at the whole sacrifice with 'who yokes thee? Let him free thee' ( Tai. S. I, 6. 6. 3). He then discharges himself from vrata with O fire, lord of vratas, I observed vrata &o.' (Tai. 8. 1. 6. 6. 3, Tai. A. IV. 41,

He then gets up and mutters a text after going out with his face to the east 'O fire, the sacri fioe is endowed with cows ...... May this sacrifice be rich in food in balls' ( Tai. S.

Then the sacrificer issues & direction the brāhmanas have to be satiated' (with dinner &c.). 

Lastly the yajamāna offers final prayers by repeating Rg. I. 189. 1, VII. 4. 1, VII. 10.3, I. 189.3, I. 189. 2, III. 6. 1 and winds up with 'salutation to thee once, twice, thrice, four times, five times, ten times, & hundred times. May there be salutation to thee up to a thousand times. Do not injure, may we be free from debts in this world, in the next world, in the third world; may we, free from debts, dwell in all the paths, those that are Devayāna (lead to the gods ) and those that lead to the pitřs.' According to Tai. S. II. 5.3.1 and Ap. III. 15. 1-5 there is an additional purodaśa offered to Indra Vaimțdha. Jai.

is an independent rite and not a mere subordinate part of the darga sacrifioe. On the other hand several writers held that it was & subordinate part (anga ) of darśa e. g. Kāt. IV. 1, 30 appears to be of that opinion and the paddhati on it notes that all bhāşyakāras like Karka stick to that opinion. 8428 The pindapitryajña is briefly described below. For details, vide Sat. Br. II. 4. 2, Tai, Br, I. 3, 10, II. 6. 16, Aśv. II. 6-7, Āp. I. 7-10, Kat. IV. 1. 1-30, Sat. II. 7, Baud, III. 10-11. It is performed on amāvāsyā day when the moon cannot be seen and its distance from the sun is the least, in the last third part of the day or when only the rays of the sun are visible on the tops of trees. 8430 The caru (boiled rice ) is cooked on the dakşiņāgni and the oblation is offered in the same. In this and other ways a contrast is brought out between rites for gods and for Manes. He kindles a blade on the dakşiņa fire and carries it to 

the south-east of that fire with the mantra' ye rûpāņi &c.' (Vaj. 8. II. 30 ).4431 All actions are to be done facing the south-east unless otherwise specified. The darbha grass (to be employed in this rite) is severed at one stroke and is brought with or without its roots ( Ap. I. 7.3-4). Strewing round the dakşiņāgni darbha grass (paristarana) with their ende turned to the south in the case of those that are placed to the north or south he spreads darbhas to the north. He places to the north-east or to the north-west of the dakşiņāgni singly the yajñapātras required in this rite on darbha grass viz. carusthalı, sürpa, sphya, mortar and pestle, sruve, dhruvā, antelope-skin, fuel-sticks cut off at one stroke, mekşana, kamandalu, and whatever else may be Decessary. The adhvaryu going to the south of the sakata (the wooden frame on which the paddy is stored and which is to the West of the fire ) fills the carusthall (vessel for cooking rice ) that is placed on the sūrpa with paddy to the brimn and removes the grains ( that rise above the brim) on to the sūrpa (which overflowing grains are returned to the sakata ). The mortar is then placed on the black antelope-skin and the wife with her face to the south-east beats with the pestle the paddy grains

taken out in the carusthall and removes the husks by means of the winnowing basket. Without trying to separate the husked grains from the unhusked ones the grains are washed once and cooked on the dakşiņa fire ( in such a way that the grains of rice are not entirely soft). He should draw with the sphya a line between the garbapatya and dakşiņa fires or to the south east of the latter with the words 'the asuras and evil-spirits that occupy the vedi are scattered away. (Vaj. S. II. 29 quoted in Sat. II. 7. p. 249 and Ap. I. 7. 13). He should then sprinkle that line ( as the vedi for this rite) with water, spread round it the darbha grass (out off with one stroke), take clarified butter in the dhruvā spoon, place it to the south of the dakşiņāgni, sprinkle on the mess of cooked rice clarified butter from the dhruvā. He places to the south of the dakşiņāgni, collyrium, unguents, & mat and a pillow. Wearing the sacred thread in the prāolnāvita form ( acoord ing to Āp. I. 8. 3 and Sat. II. 7. p. 248 the adhvaryu wears it in the upavita form) he offers on the fire the idhma (i. e. fifteen fuel-stioks), takes a portion of the boiled rice with the mekşaņa, pours clarified butter over it, outs off two portions of the rice on it, again sprinkles clarified butter over 2438 the portions and the rice from which they are taken, offers into the dakşiņa fire one āhuti ( oblation) with the words 'Somāya pitsmate svadhā namah', then again sprinkles clari fied butter on the portion out off and offers it with the words 'Agnaye kavyavābanāy& svadbā namaḥ'. He 2488 then throws the mekşana on to the fire. Then on the line made with the spbya he sprinkles water tbrioe 2434 with the mantras "Sundbantām pitaraḥ, sundhantām pitamabāḥ, sundhantām prapitā mahāḥ (may the fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers wash themselves puro ). He offers three balls of rice on that line one after another with the hand turned sideways ( i. e. the pinda is let off on the line from the part of the palm between the thumb

and the index finger ) with appropriate mantras, the first to the father with the words 'this is for you father, 8435 N. N. and those who come after you', to the grand-father with the words 'this is for you grand-father &o.', to the great-grandfather with similar words. The pinda ( ball of rice) for the great-grand father is the biggest of the three, that for the grand-father being larger than that for the father. There was a difference of view among the teacbers as to the procedure when any of the three ancestors was living, Gāpagāri holding that piņdas were offered only to the deceased ancestors and he who was living was oply honoured, while Taulvali said that pindas were to be offered to three ancestors whether living or dead and Gautama stating that if any ancestor out of the first three above the sacrificer was alive, three pindas were to be offered and an ancestor beyond the great-grand-father may then be included. Aøv.(II. 6. 20-23) refutes all these views by saying that no pinda can be offered to any ancestor beyond the great-grand-father and none to those who are alive nor to any ancestor between whom and & preceding ancestor & living ancestor intervenes, but that the pindas meant for ancestors that are alive may be tbrown into fire (with spābā at the end and not svadha ). According to Ap. I. 9.8 and Sat. p. 252 if the householder's father be living he should not offer pindas but should stop after he performs the homa, If he has 2438 two fathers or grand fathers or great-grand-fathers (owing to adoption or niyoga) he should take two names with reference to the pinda offered to that ancestor. When the pindas are placed on the line referred to above he invokes the piņdas with a formula. Here you may regale yourselves, O pitfs and may you partake according to your shares' (Vāj.S.11.31).8439 Then he turns round and faces the nortb, sits down holding his breath till he feels exhausted, then again turns round and faces the piņdas and utters the invocation

'the pitys have regaled themselves and have partaken according to their shares' ( Vāj. 8. II. 31). He smells the boiled rioe. Then he again offers water ( ninayana) with the words Sun dhantām &o.', ( vide above p. 1087 ) on the line made with the sphya, he puts on the three pindas one after another the unguents and collyrium respectively with the words 'asau abhyankşya' (you by name so and so father &o, apply the unguents ) and 'asau ankşva' (you go and so father, &o. put the collyrium in the eye). He should then place 88 garment on each of the piņdas the hem of a garment ( daśā ) or woolen tuft or a hair from his own body (the part above navel) if he is beyond fifty years of age with the words 'O pitss, this is the garment for you, may you not come in contact with any other ( garment ) than this' ( Ašv. II. 7, 6). Then he should wait upon the pitřs with salutation and mutter the mantra 'saluta tion to you, Pitrs, for ( securing ) food, salutation to you, Pitrs, for strength' &o. 1438 and also the three verses 'manonvā. huvāmabe' (Rs. X. 57, 3-5 ).8488 He should then make the pitřs start forward on a stream of water ( i. e. by pouring water on the pipdas) with the mantra O well-disposed pitys! May you depart away by the ancient and awe-inspiring paths, after bestowing on us wealth and welfare. May you send down to us prosperity including all manly sons' (vide Tai. S. I. 8. 5. 2 for first half). He should walk a little towards the dakşiņāgni with the verse Rg. IV. 10.1 and then towards the gārbapatya with the mantra 'May the garbapatya fire deliver me from whatever sin I may have committed against Heaven and Earth, or parents and may the same fire make me sinless (Tai. S. I. 8.5.3). He should take hold of the middle piņda with the words 'Opitre 1 bestow'on me a valiant (son)' and should make his wife eat that ball of rice with the mantra 2440

O pitsg1 may you deposit an embryo that will be a young boy wearing a lotus wreath, so that he may be unhurt' ( compare Vaj. S. II. 33). The other two pindag may be thrown into water or fire or a person who has recently lost all appetite for food may eat the two or one who is harassed by some incurable disease ( such as leprosy or tuberculosis ) may eat them, the result being that he is either cured or dies. Kat. IV. 1. 20 adds that the adhvaryu collects the pindas in a pot and the house-holder bends down and takes the smell thereof. ** Then the darbha blades taken out with one stroke are thrown into the fire, the utensils are sprinkled with water and then taken up in twos and laid aside. 

A householder who had not consecrated the three vedio fires also had to perform the piņda-pitr-yajña on amāvāsya, but he offered it in the grhya fire. Vide Aśv, Sr. II. 7, 18, Sam. K. P. 838ff, Sam. Pr. 908 ff. Gaut. V. 5 prescribes that a house. holder should at least daily offer water to the pitrs and do more (i. e. offering food &c.) according to his ability and inclination. Manu II. 176 prescribes daily pitr-tarpaņa (satiating the pitre with water ), for which see pp. 668-69.

CĀTURMĀSYAS (seasonal sacrifices ) 2442 

TD 1 

According to Ašv. II. 14. 1 the term Istyayana comprehends the Cāturmāsyas, Turāyana, Dākşayana and other iştis. The cāturmāsyas are three (or four according to some ), viz. Vai ve deva, Varuņapraghāsa, Sākamedha ( and Sundsirlya ). Each of these is called & parvan ( part or joint ) of the cāturmāsyas. They are called cāturmāsyas because each of them takes place after four months. 2448 They are performed respectively on the Full Moon days of Phalguna (or Caitra ), of Aşādba, Kārtika and on the 5th full moon from the day on which the Sākamedha is performed (i.e. on Phālguns) or two or three days before it (com, on Āśv. II. 20.2). They indicate the advent of three seasons viz. vaganta ( spring ), varş& (rains) and hemanta *** (autumn). If the Vaišvadevaparva is performed on Caitra Full Moon, then the Varuņapraghāsas and Sākamedhas will be performed on Srāvapa and Mārgaśfrşa Full Moon days respeo. tively. The Tai. Br. 1. 6.8 states the reward secured by the performance of the cāturmāsyas. 2445 

According to Āsv. on the day previous to the Full Moon of Phalguna when beginning the cāturmāsyas he performs an işti for ( Agni) Vaišvānara and Parjanya. According to Kāt. V, 1.2 there is an option viz, he may perform this işti or the Anvārambhaniyā işti. Then on the Full Moon day he performs the Vaišvadeva işti in the morning and then performs the

pārnamāsa işti. According to the com. on Kat.V.1. the Vaišvadeva işti is performed in the morning of the first day after Full Moon and then follows the purpamāsa işti of Phālguna. The sacrificer has to keep certain observances on all the parvans of the cātur māsyas viz. he has to sbavehis head and face, to sleep on the ground (not on a cot), to avoid honey, meat, salt, sexual intercourse and decorations of the body. There is an option as to shaving the moustaches and beard viz. he should shave only on the first and last parvans or may do so on all four. There are five offerings common to all cāturmāsyas, viz., & purodāsa (cake) on eight potsherds for Agni, boiled rice (caru) for Soma, a purodaša on 1% or 8 potsherds (12 according to Txi. S. I. 8. 2) for Savitf (upāmšu, inaudibly), a caru for Sarasvati, a oaru of finely ground rice for Paşan. The reward secured by the performance of the cāturm.sya847 is beaven. The caturmāsyas may be performed throughout life or for one year only. 

In the introductory işti to Vaišvānara and Parjanya, there is & cake prepared on twelve potsherds for Vaišvānara and caru for Parjanya. The anuvākyā verses (according to Āśv.) for the two are vai vānaro ajijanad-agpir &c.' ( Asy. II. 15, % sets out the whole ) and 'parjanyāya pragāyata' (Rg. VII. 102. 1 ) respec tively and the yājyā verses respectively are 'prsto divi' (Rg. 1. 98. 2) and 'pra vāta vānti' (Rg. V. 83. 4). In the Vaišva deva-parvan itself there are ( besides the five offerings oommon to all caturmāsyas) three more offeringe viz, & cake ( purodāsa ) on seven potsherds for Marut Svatavas (self-strong) or for the Maruts, a payasyk (or āmikṣā, according to Baud.

Kat. (V. 1. 21-24) requires that this Vaidvadeva-parvan should be performed in a spot which inolines towards the east,4449 that the sacrificer and his wife each put on two fresh and unworn garments ( one lower and the other upper) which they have to wear again at the Varupapraghācaparvan, Kāt. (V. 1. 25-26 ) following Šat. Br. (II. 5. 1) says that barbis ( sacred grass to be strewn on sacrifioial ground ) is tied up in three bunches separately with a rope of grass and then all three bunches are tied together with a bigger rope and therein ( i. e. inside this last rope ) is thrust a bunch of flowering kuša grads, which is to be used as prastara. After putting the yajāapātras:450 on the sacrificial ground, fire is produced by churning from the aranis. Being directed by the adhvaryu the hotę priest repeats at the time of churning fire the verses Rg. I. 24. 3, I. 22. 13, VI. 16. 13-15 ( except the last pāda of VI. 16. 15 ) and stops till he receives another direction (sampraiga ) from the adhvaryu. If fire is not produced at once the hotr should go on repeating the hymn, Rg. X, 118, till fire is struck from the aranis. "451 On hearing from the adhvaryu that fire is produced and that he should repeat a formula for that event, the botr repeats the last pada of Rg. VI. 16. 15 at which he had stopped (after the syllable om added at the end of that Verse of Rg. X. 118 at which he hears about the production of fire). Then be should repeat Rg.

five prayājas and three anuyajas. The number nine of the prayājas 48% is made up by adding before the 5th prayāja of the Darsapūrņamāsa four as stated in the note below. Rg. V. 82.7 and VI. 71. 6 are the anuvākya and yājyā for the offering to Savitr, Rg. VI. 54. 9 and VI. 58.1 for that to Pūşan and VII. 59. 11 and VI. 66. 9 for that to Maruts.84** The nine anuyājas are made up by adding after the first anuyaja of the dar apūrpa māss six more. After the anuyajas, or after the sūktavāka or samyuvāka, an offering of vājina is made to the deities called Vajins. The remainder of the vājina is brought in a vessel and is dealt with in the same way as ida (i. e. it is placed in the folded hands of the hotr by the adhvaryu, the hotr then holds it in his left hand and then on the right hand some ghee is sprinkled by the adhvaryu and then two portions of the vājina are put thereon and then again some ājya is sprinkled over it), the vessel is then raised as bigh as the mouth or nose, the hotr should request the other priests in order ( as done in the note) to repeat an invocation ( upahava ) with a mantra and then the hots, adhvaryu, brahma and agaidhra partake of the vajina by merely smelling \#455 it. The sacrificer partakes of the vājina actually. Kāt. (V. 2.9 and 12 ) adds that the adhvaryu offers three offerings called samişta-yajus respectively to Vāta, Yajñ& and Yajñapati with three mantras (viz. Vāj. VIII. 21, 22 first half and 22 latter half) or only one samişta-yajus may be offered ( with Vaj. S. VIII. 21 ) in Vaišvadeva and Sunāsiriya parvans. According to the Sat. Br. (II. 5. 1, 21 ) the dakşiņa in this rite is the first born calf of the season. Kāt.

Varuņapraghāsa.3456 The word Varupapragbaba is masculine and is always employed in the plural. The Sat. Br. (II. 5. 2. 1) gives a fanciful etymology viz. that yavas (barley grains ) belong to Varupa and as these are eaten (from ghas to eat) in this rite it is so called. This rite is performed in the rainy season four months after Vai vedeva on the Full Moon day of Aşadha or of Srāvana. The sacrificer should go out of bis house to a spot where plenty of shrubs grow. Two altars ( vedi) have to be prepared to the east of the abavapiya inclined towards the east, one south of the other. The northern vedi is in charge of the adhvaryu and the southern one in charge of his assistant, the pratiprasthātr ( Ap. VIII. 5.5.). The latter follows the adh varyu in doing the same actions on the southern vedi that are done by the adhvaryu on the northern vedi except carrying the water forward, girding the wife, producing fires and a few others specified in Kāt. V. 4. 33; all the orders (sampraişas, like agnaye samidhyamānāya anubrühi') are to be uttered once and everything that concerns the uttering of words is to be done by the adhvaryu only (Ap. VIII. 5. 17 )8459. But Jai. XII. 1. 18 says that the mantras for taking ajya, for prokşaña and the like are to be reoited by the two separately. The procedure is like that of Vaišvadovaparvan except where special directions are given. The two vedis are separated from each other by a space ( at the corners ) two, three or four angulas or a span or even wider (Ap. VIII, 5. 10). There is a single utkara. The pratiprasthātmoves between the two vedis. On the previous day he makes ready pots full of karambha i. e. husked grains of barley slightly fried on the dakşiņa fire, ground and mixed

2467. Jaimini XI. 2. 36-43 deals with the question that pratipra athats door on the southern vedi whatever adhyaryo doos on the nothorn. Jai. further (XI. 2. 44-48 ) states that though there are two vedis and the prati prasthats follows tho adhvaryu in doing all that he door, thero is not a double set of priests.1096 

History of Dharmasastra (Oh. XXXI with curds ( Kāt. V. 3. 2). According to Ap. (VIII, 6. 3) it is the wife that makes these karambhapātras. These pātras exoved by one the number of the children (sons, unmarried daughters, grandsons and unmarried grand-daughters) of the house-holder ( Kāt. V. 3. 3-5, Āp. VIII. 5. 41, who inoludes daughters-in-law) or they are at least three ( if the house-holder is childless or bas only a son or two). The figures of a ram and ewe are also made of the remaining part of the ground and fried barley used for the karambhapātras, the male being made by the adhvaryu and the female by the pratiprasthāts and each figure having the characteristic signs of sex. The figures of the ram and owe are covered by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr respectively with a bunch of the wool of some animal other than the odakā (wild goat ) or with the ground tips of kuša (in the absence of wool). Besides the five offerings common to all oaturmāsyas ( these being offered in the Varuņa praghāsas with all attributes and subsidiaries as in Vaisva deva, according to Jai. VII. 1. 17-21 ), in this rite offerings are made to four more, viz. Indra and Agai, the Maruts, Varuņa and Ka 1. o. Prajapati (Ašv. II. 17. 14) and the offerings are a cake on twelve potaherds (for Indrāgni), payasyā or amikşa (for Maruts and Varuña) and a cake on one potsherd for Ka silently. All offerings are made from yava or only the karambhapātras are so made and the figures of the ram and the ewe also are made from yava and the rest from rice grains ( Āp. VIII. 5. 36-37). The anuvākya and yājyā verses of each of these four special offerings to Indrāgni, Maruts, Varuņa and Ka are respectively&\#88 Rg. VII. 94. 18, VI. 60.1; I. 86. 1, V. 58. 5; I. 25. 19, I. 24.11; IV.31.1, X. 121.1 (Asv. II. 17. 15). Straight to the east of the āhavaniya about three prakramas from it the northern vedi is prepared and several rules are laid down in Kāt. (V. 3. 13 f) and its com. about its extent. The northern vedi is six or seven aratnis in length from west to east, its western side is four aratnis and its eastern side is three aratnis or the vedi may be even much larger than this. On this vedi a fireplace is constructed with the earth dug up from the sacrificial pit called cātvala which is measured with & yoke-pin 32 angulas in length and made to the east of the utkara and after leaving a space between it and the utkara for

the priests to move about. The pit is knee-deep, is outside the uttaravedi to its east and is measured from the northern corner of the uttaravedi at a distance equal to the yoke-pin and is square, the east side being 32 angulas in extent or of the vadi or of the extent of a yoke or of ten steps of the yajamāna (on all sides ). In the midst of the northern vedi a hole (nābhi) is made, a span in length on four sides and having four corners or it may be ne large as the boof of a bull or a horse. On the uttaravedi water is sprinkled with a mantra and gravel is also spread with 'a lioness art thou' (Vāj. S. V.10). That night the uttaravedi is covered with darbhas. In the morning the adbvaryu and pratiprasthāty carry forward fire on to the two vedis from the gārbapatya (according to Ap. VIII. 5. 22) or from the āhavaniya (according to Kāt. V. 4. 2-3) by means of kindled fuel-sticks (idbma ) held in earthen pots or by dividing the āhavaniya in two parts. Jai, ( VIL 3, 23-25 ) declares that the carrying forward of the fire is done only in the Varuņapraghases and Sakamedhas. The pratiprastbātr draws with the sphya a line from the āhavaniya to the northern bind corner of the southern vedi or of the uttara vedi ( according to Kat. V, 4. 9-10) or be connects the two vedis ( Ap. VIII. 5. 20) by drawing a line from the north hind corner of the southern vedi to the south front corner of the uttaravedi. He surrounds the hole (nābbi ) with three sticks (paridhis), one span long, of dovadāru tree on the west, aouth and north ( with Vāj. S. V. 13 ) and puts down thereon guggulu ( bdellium ) and perfumed substances and the hair on the head or between the horns of a ram and places the fires on these materials ( sambhāras ). The pratiprasthātr places dakşiņa fire on & square mound of one aratni in length after drawing lines and sprinkling water. The figure of tbe ram is put in the payasyā meant for Maruts and that of the ewe in the payanya meant for Varuņa. The liquid called vājina ( of both payasyās ) is collected in separate pots and in the payasy& are put the fruit of karfra and leaves of bami. All the offerings except the payasya for Maruts and the pots of karambha are placed by the adhvaryu on the uttaravedi; while the pratipresthati places the payasya for Maruts together with the pot for ajya and also the karambha pot ( if the yaya grains for them had not been taken out by the adhvaryu ) on the southern Vedi and the vajina is placed near the utkara by both. When the adhvaryu Ingues a direction to the dgnidhra 'please sweep olean the paridhi of the two fres' (the two dhavanlyns on the two vedia) with the ropes binding the idhma, the pratiprasthātr goes to the

She either declares the names of her lovers or lifts up ( if she feels shame in the declaration) as many blades from the bunoh of darbhas lying on the ground as the number of lovers she has had. If she names any, he (the pratiprasthātr ) declares that Varuña will seize him or them. If she con ceals the truth, the result would be that ber dear rela tives would suffer. Il abe bas none she says Bo. In that Case or when she has declared or intimated her lover or lovers, the pratiprasthāts makes her repeat the verse pragbāsino havamaho' ( Vāj. III. 44). The pots are placed in a sūrpa made of işika (reed) in which a little ajya is sprinkled, then there is further sprinkling of ajya thereon twice ( abbigbārana), the bürpa is placed on the head of the wife who is led by the pratiprasthats between the fires and the seats of the brabmā priest and the sacrificer to the east of both a havaniyas and then to the northern vedi; and she standing to the east of the dakşipa fire with her face to the west takes down from her head the sūrpa into her right hand and offers the contents ( using the sürpa *as a juhu ladle ) into the daksina fire with mo gu pa indrātra ' ( Rg. I. 173. 12, Vāj. S. III. 46 or Tai. 8. I. 8.3.1) muttered by the sacrificer and with the verge 'yad grāme' (Vāj. S. III. 45, Tai. 8. I. 8. 3. 1) uttered by the wife as offering prayer ( yajya ). Ap. (VIII. 6. 26 ) says that the adhvaryu or pratiprasthātę may offer the oblation of karambha pots and the sacrificer and his wife may only touch bis band from behind. When the pratiprasthats leads back the wife to her seat near the gārhapatya fire ( by the same way that she came) he makes her repeat the verse 'akran karma' (Vaj. S. III, 47, Tai. S. l. 8.3.1).

on twelve potsherds and then sits silent. Then the prati. prasthats outs off a portion of the amiksā for Maruts together with the whole of the figure of the ewe (this is the first avadana) and offers it into fire. He mixes the second portion of the payasya for Maruts with the leaves of śami and fruits of karlra and offers it. Then the adhvaryu offers two portions from the ani. kşā meant for Varuņa mixing the figure of the ram in the first or second avadana for Varuņa. According to Ap. (VIII. 6. 31) the adhvaryu offers the first portion of the payasya along with the figure of the ram and the second portion of payasya having in it the fruit of karira and the leaves of sami. Then the adh varyu offers the oake to Ka silently. Then both adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr make an offering to Agni Sviştakýt. The fee ( dakşiņa) is either & cow with its call or a horse or six or twelve bulls. 3461 

The rite is conoluded by the priests and the saorificer and his wife going for a bath (avabhrtha) in a river9463 or the like taking with them the remainder of payasyā for Varuna and the scrap ings from the pan that are treated like the refuse (rjiga of Soma). The remainder of payasyā serves as havis ( sacrificial offering ) at the avabbftha, a portion of which is offered to Varuna and the whole of what remains is offered to Agni and Varuņa instead of to Agni Sviştskpt. The saorificer and his wife silently oome to the water, tbrow into the water the sorapings (nişkāsa ) that are placed in a vessel (sthall) with a mantra (Vaj. 8. III, 48, according to Kat. V. 5. 30 and 'gamudre te 'Tai, . I. 4. 45.2, according to Ap. VIII. 8. 12 ). They do not plunge their heads into water but only splash water over their heads and rub each other's backs with water. They then put on new clothes and make a gift of the clothes so far worn (that they had already worn at the Vaišvadeva-parvan) to one of the (five ) priests or to another (worthy ) person at their pleasure. After returning to the house the sacrificer puts a fuel-stick on the ahavaniya (with Vāj. 8. VIII. 27). Jai. (VII. 3. 12-15 ) states that this avabhỉtha has the same characteristios as the avabhrtha in

Somayaga and that the material offered therein is the sorapings from the pan and not the purodasa ( VII. 3. 16). 

Sākamedha ***3 

This third parvan of the cāturmāsy as is described at great length in Baud., Ap. and Kat. Only a few salient features are brought out below. 'Sakamedha' is used in the plural, since there are many rites therein and many and various offerings (com, on Kat. V, 6. 1). It literally means 'kindling along with or at the same time as' (sākam edha ). The name is probably given because the first offering in it is a cake on eight potsherds offered to Agni Anikavat with the rise ing sun.**** It is performed four months after the Varups praghasas on the Full Moon day of Kārtika or Mārgatirşa ( according as the Vaišvadeva-parvan was performed on the full moon of Phalguna or Caitra ). The whole of this parvan requires two days. On the day previous to the full moon there are three iştis offered at the three savanas ( morning, midday and evening) to the three deities respectively, viz. to Agni Anikavat a cake on eight potsherds in the morning, to Santa pana Maruta caru (oblation of cooked rice) at midday, to Grhamedhin Maruts in the evening a caru boiled in the milk of all the cows belonging to the sacrificer (Ap. VIII. 9. 8). As regards tbis last caru it is stated (Ap. VIII. 10.8 and VIII. 11. 8-10, Kat. V. 6. 29-30) that if plenty of rice is cooked the priests and the sons and grandsons of the sacrificer (who have had the upanayana performed ) eat the food to satiety and go to sleep that night in the same hall without indulging in any talk about poverty or bunger. Jaimini ( V. 1. 19-22 ) refers to the text'agnaye anikavate pratar-aştakapālaḥ &o.' and states 88 the conclusion that all the tbree rites are performed on one day and no part of the three is to be performed the next day. On that night the milch cows are let loose to mix up among their calves ( whloh oan then drink the milk of their mothers with out let or hindrance ).. He, however, binds down that calf which is required for milking the cow that has lost its own oalf (and whioh is to be milked the next morning for the offerings

to the Manes ). That night and in the next morning agaihotra is performed with rios gruel (and not with milk). On the next day (the principal day of Sakamedba) the sacrificer either before or after the daily agnibotra performs a homa with a darui taking & portion of the boiled rice sticking to the bottom of the sthall (pot) that had been cooked for the offering to Grbamedhin Maruts the previous evening. He fills the darvi3486 (ladle ) with a mantra (Vaj. S. III. 49, Tai. S. I. 8. 4. 1). Then the adhvaryu directs the yajamāna to fetch a bull and make it bellow. When the bull bellows, he offers the rice in the darvi into fire with a mantra (Vaj. S. III. 50, Tai. S. I. 8. 4. 1). If the bull does not bellow, then the oblation is offered after the brahmā priest directs offer'Ašv. ( II. 18. 11-12) states that the home may be offered ( if the bull does not bellow) at the thunder of a cloud or some make the āgnidhra roar calling him * brabmaputra' ('the son of the brahmā priest', whose assistant he is). The bull is given ag fee to the adhvaryu. Then an isti is offered to Kridin Maruts with & cake cooked on seven potsherds and a caru to Aditi. This is followed by a mahāhavis ( a great offering), which consists of eight offerings to eight deities. They are five offerings common to all cāturmdeyas, the 6th offering is a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni, the 7th is caru to Mahendra (or according to Ašv. II. 18. 18 to Indra, or Výtrahan Indra or Mahendra ), the 8th is & cake on one potsherd to Vibvakarman 2466 ( inaudibly ). According to Ap. he offers the 8th offering of a cake after taking the naines of the four months Sabas, Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya ( 1 e. Mārga sirşa to Phalguna). A bull is the fee of this Mahāhavis (or a COW acoording to Ap.). 

After the mahahavis comes the pitļyajāa which is called mahapitryajña. To the south of the dakşiņa ire a now vedi having four corners in the four principal directions 2407 is prepared and has the same length and breadth as the height 

2466, According to the com. on Kāt. V. 6. 40 this darvi-boma in oftorod in the ahayanlya, whilo according to Āp. VIII. 11, 19 it is offered in Garbapatys. The oblation is meant for Indra.

of the sacrificer (Ap. VIII. 13, %). He brings are from the dakşiņa fire and lays it on the new vedi in the centre and all offerings that are to be offered in the ahavaniya are offered in this fire. In this mahapitryajia the wife does nothing. In this yajña a cake on six kapalas is offered to Somavat Pitss or to Pitsmat Soma, dhānās (fried barley ) to Barhişad Pitrs, mantha 246% to Agnişvātta Pitrs. Ašv. II. 19. 21 adds another deity viz. Yama and according to some (vide Ap. VIII. 13. 16 ) the devatās and offerings are ājya to Pitpmat Soma, a cake on six potsherds to Barhişad Pitrs, fried barley to Agnisvātta Pitrs and mantha to Yama or Agni Kavyavāhana or Yama Angi. rasvat Piirmat. The beating of grains ( with a pestle) and grinding is done by the adhvaryu or Agnidhra to the east of the gārhapatya fire with his face to the south. The cake is cooked on burning coale taken with a shovel from the gārba patya to its south and the dhānā is fried on the dakşināgai. There are only four prayājas ( omitting barhis out of the five at the darsapūrpamāsa) and so also snuyājas. Instead of the usual direotion (called āśruta ) of the adhvaryu to the āgnl dhra 'O grāyaya', in this rite be utters 'Om svadhā'; simi larly the āgnidhra responds (pratyāśruta ) with 'astu svadh.' instead of the usual 'astu grauşat' and instead of the syllable 'vausat' uttered at the end the words 'svadbā namaḥ' are employed. Instead of the concluding offering usually made to Agni Sviştakřt, in this rite it is made to Agni Kavyayabana. In this rite two anuvākyās and one yājyā are repeated at each offering i. e. Rg. X, 15. 1, IX. 96. 11 are the two anuvāky.s and Rg. X. 15. 5 the yajyā for Somavat Pitrs, Rg. I. 91. I and I. 91. 20 are the anuvākyās and VIII. 48. 13 tbe yājga for Pitsmat Soma, Rg.

round the vedi from right to left. He offers water for washing the feet to the three ancestors (of the saorificer) in the north west, south-west and south-east corners of the vedi respectively. He mixes portions of the cake, the fried barley and the mantha and prepares three balls therefrom and offers them facing the south on the three corners referred to above for the three ances tors with the appropriate mantras ( etat te tata 2469 ye ca tvām anu, etat te pitamaba &c.). Aocording to Ap. (VIII. 16. 7) he prepares three more piņdas for the three ancestors beyond the paterpal great-grand-father and invokes them on the piņdas in the reverse order i. e. the sixth anoestor on the first (out of these other three piņdas ), the fifth on the 2nd pinda and the fourth on the 3rd. He then wipes off the remnants of the pindas (pindalepa ) stioking to the hand on the north-eastern corner of the yedi with 'atra pitaro' ( Vāj. S. II. 31 first half ). The priests and the sacrificer with faces to the north leave that place, wear the sacred thread in the upavita form and wait upon the āhavaniya with Vāj. S. III. 51-52 ( = Tai. S. I. 8. 5. 1-2 ), and on the gārhapatya with Vāj. S. III. 53-55 ( =Tai, S. I. 8. 5. 2-3). Then entering the vedi the sacrificer, wearing the sacred thread in the prācināvita form, mutters the mantra amimadanta' (Vaj. 8. II. 31 latter half). They sprinkle the vedi from left to right and do all the rest as in pindapitryajña, The sacrificer then folds his hands with namo vah' ( Vaj. S. II. 32 ) or makes six namaskāras (salutations ) and invokes the blessing 

give us house' (Vaj. S. II. 32). This rite ends with Samyu ( Ašv. II. 19. 2, Kāt. V. 9, 32) i. e. 'taochamyorā ...... sam catuspade' (Tai. Br. III. 5. 11 ) and there is no patnisamyāja homa in dakşiņa fire and so on. The remaining portion of the material for offerings is thrown into the fire or into water or may be eaten by the priests.

Some of its peculiarities may be noted. In this the adhvaryu takes out material to prepare cakes cooked on one potsherd exceeding by one the children (the sons and grandsons together with their wives and unmarried daughters ) of the sacrificer or at least four ( if he is childless or has no more than a few children).

He places the single firebrand in & spot where four roads meet and whloh has the usual five purifying rites performed on it and ofers thereon with the middle leaflet of a palasa loaf (used as the juhu ladle ) portions out off once each from all the cakes prepared for Rudra with the mantra 'O Rudra! this is your portion, may you partake of it together with Ambika, your sister, svāha' (Tai.

Besides the five offerings common to all cāturmāsyas, the special offerings in this işti are a cake on twelve potsberds to Sundsfrau (V&yu and Aditya, according to com. on Kāt. V. 11.5 and to Indra Sunasira, according to Ap. VIII. 20.5 and com.), an oblation of fresh warm milk ( not heated) direct from the cow to Vāyu, a cake on one potsherd to Sürya. There is no uttaravedi in this rite, and no fire is produced by attrition. There are five prayājas, three anuyājas and one sam istayajus, but according to Ap. VIII. 20. 6 there are nine prayājas and anuyajas. The dakşiņā for the rite is a plough with six bulls or two big bulls and for the cake to Sürya a white horse or a white bull (Kat. V. 11. 12-14), while aocording to Tai, S. I. 8.7 it is a plough to whioh twelve oxen are yoked and scoording to Ap. (VIII. 20. 9-10) a plough with twelve or six oxen. 

Sundsirau' occurs in the Rgveda IV, 57.5 and 8. In Rg. IV. 57.4 and 8 the word 'gunam' ocours several times. The meaning is doubtful. According to Yaska's Nirukta IX. 40 Śuna and Sira mean Vāyu and Aditya respectively; while the Śat. Br. II. 6. 3. 2 appears to hold that suna means prosperity and sira means ' essence or gap' (sāra ) and this işti is so oalled because the sacrificer thereby secures both prosperity and sap.

Āgrayana (offering of first fruits ) 1475 This is an işti, without performing which an āhitāgni was not to make use of freshly harvested rice, barley and millet. It was either performed on a New Moon day or Full Moon day, but the procedure was the same as that of the işti on New Moon. The time of the āgrayana isti with rice is sarad (autumn) when one had ample rains. *476 As barley crops became ready in vasanta (spring), the āgrayana for yavas was to be per formed in spring. Ašv, allowed an option that when the işti was once performed in the autumn one may not perform it in spring for the barley crop. The işti for millet crop ( syāmāka) was performed in the rainy season and therein a caru was offered to Soma. The işti was so called because therein the first fruits ( agra ) were first employed or eaten ( ayana ). 3477 According to Ap. (VI. 29. 6) there are 17 kindling versos ( sāmidbeni ), whioh number is obtained by inserting two additional verses called dhāyyā after the 8th or 9th sāmidheni of the darka-pürņa-masa işti. The deities and offerings are a cako on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni (or according to Āp. VI. 29. 10 and Asv. II. 9. 13, it is either Aindrāgna or Agnendra ), *& oaru cooked in milk or water for All Gods (Vißve Devah ) silently, a cake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth and caru to Soma ( if the first fruits are millets ).

The anuvaky& and Yajya verses of these are respectively Rg.

II. 9. 4 prescribe that he may make his agnihotra cow eat the first fruits, viz., rice or barley bundles or food and with the milk of that cow perform on the &grayana day the home. But this alternative was not open to the king who bad to perform this işti (Ašv. II. 9. 6). According to Kāt. (IV. 6. 16-17) the caru of millets for Soma is performed only for the forest-dweller and a caru of bamboo seed is prescribed for Soma in summer. About the dakşiņā there are various opinions. According to Kāt. ( IV. 6. 18 ) it is either a repaired waggon or silken oloth, madhuparks ( I. e. honey, ourds and ghee ) or the cloth worn by the gaorificer in the rains. Acoording to Ap. (VI. 30. 7) the first among the calves born before the Full Moon of Māgha is the fee, and cloth for işti with millets. Jai. bas several sūtras about silk cloth and a calf being the dakşiņā in this rite and that rice cooked on daksins fire is not the fee ( vide X. 3. 34-38 ). Vide also Jai, XII. 2. 34-37 (about the characteristics of the barhis). 

The &grayana sacrifice in the gļhya fire has been already described (pp. 827-829 ) and it will have been noticed that it Was a replica of the frauta sacrifice meant for those who had consecrated the three Vedio fires. 

Kāmyeşti In the Srauta sūtras there are rules for the performance of several iştis on the occurrence of certain events or for the pur pose of securing some desired object. Ašv. II. 10-14, Ap.

II. 10. 8-9), Lokeşti, Mahāvairāji ( Ašv. II. 11. 1-4 ) or Mitravindā (Kat. V. 1%, for one who is desirous of prosperity, territory, friends and long life, addressed to ten deities ), Samjñāni ( for the reconciliation of those who have fallen out), Kāririşti 2478 ( for one who desires rain, Ašv. IL 13, 1-13, Ap. XIX. 25. 16 ff), Turāyana (Asv. II. 14. 4-6), 

2478. The Kalikapurāpa quoted in the Vyavahāramayukba (p. 114 toxt) prescribes that on adopting a son who is about fivo yoars old (or more ) the adopter should perform the putrepti.

PASUBANDHA OR NIRŪDHAPASUBANDH A 2481 

(immolation of an animal in sacrifice ). 

The animal sacrifice is an independent sacrifice and it is also performed in soma sacrifices as a constituent part (anga ). The independent animal sacrifice is oalled nirūdhapasubandha ( offering of an eviscerated animal) and the subordinate ones are called saumika ( Ašv. III. 8. 3-4). The nirudhapašu is really & modification of an animal sacrifice in somayage (called agnişomiya pašu ) 28 Jai. VIII. 1. 13 declares, but in many gūtras the full procedure of both is set out in the nirudha. pašu section ( vide Kāt. VI. 10.32 and com. on Kat. VI. 1. 31 ). The nirudhapasubandha itself becomes the prakști (arche type or model) of all other animal sacrifices, except savaniya pašu and anubandhyapasu. The independent animal sacrifice is to be performed every six months or every year by the āhitāgni throughout his life.348% If done once a year it was to be performed in the rainy season (i. e. in Srāvana or Bhadrapada) on New moon or Full moon day or if done six monthly then at the beginning of the southward and northward passages of the Sun ( dakşiņāyana and uttarayana ). Then it may have to be performed on any day and not necessarily on amā vāsyā or paurpam.si. According to Asv. (IIL. 1. 2-6) optionally an isti before and after the independent pagubandha rite may be per formed and if performed it is offered either to Agni or to Agai. Vişnu or to Agni and Agni-Vişnu. In this sacrifice there is a sixth priest called Maitrāvaruna ( or Praśāsts) in addition to the five required in the cāturmāsyas. An udumbara staff is given to the sacrifioer when he is initiated for a sporifice like Agniştoma, In the pašubandha when the Maitrāvaruņa enters the sacrifioial ground after the priests are chosen the adhvaryu

(or yajamāna in some gakhas ) 2488 hands over that staff ( which in length would reach the mouth of the sacrificer) to the maitrāvarupa with a mantra and the maitrāvaruņa accepts it with a corresponding mantra. The maitrāvarupa standa slightly bent to the south of the seat of the hote resting his staff on the vedi and utters directions to the bots to repent yājyās. Till he utters the first praişa he is not to touch himself or any one else with the staff. The maitrāvarups is to utter in & standing posture while holding the staff tbe praigas and the apuvākyas wherever a praişa is employed and do & few otber acts standing; but the rest of his duties in some sacrifices he does sitting. Jaimini (IV. 2. 16-18) has a discussion ( arising out of Tai. S. VI. 1. 4. 2 "krite some maitrāvaruņ&ya dandam prayaochati') on the question whether the handing over of the staff to maitrāvaruņa is & pratipattikarma or an arthakarma (the oonclusion is that it is the latter). The adhvaryu makes an offering of clarified butter in the ahavaniya, which is called yüpāhuti, with the sruva or with a sruc in which four lodlings of ajya have been poured, with the mantra'uru viņpo' (Vaj. 8. V. 41, Tai. 8. I. 3.4.1). The adhvaryu, taking the rest of the djya and the sruva, goes to a place where trees grow, accompanied by a carpenter (takşan) holding an axe (Ap. VII. 1.13 and Kāt. VI. 1.5). The sacrificial post (yüpa) 484 is to be made of the palada, khadira, bilva or rauhitaka tree according as one desires Various rewards (Ap. VII.1.16), but in Soma sacrifices the yüpa must be of khadira, if possible. Jai. (VI. 3.28-30) states that, if by accident the sacrificial post made of one kind of tree is destroyed during the continuanoe of the rite, another yüpa of the same treo or of a tree very similar to it is to be substituted The tree to be out must be full of leaves, must not have its top dried up, must be straight and growing on a level spot, and its branches must be turned upwards and it should be bent in some direction other than the south. Adhvaryu, brahma, the saorificer and carpenter touch the tree after selecting it with the mantra' atyanyān' (Vaj. S. V. 4%, Tai. 8, I. 3, 5). The adhvaryu touches the trunk of the tree all round ( where it is to be out ) with the sruva anointed with ajya with the mantra

*May god Savitr anoint thee with madhu' (Tai. 8. I. 3. 5 ) or with Vişpave tva' (Vaj. 8. V, 42). He keeps obliquely & darbha blade on the trunk with the words 'ogadhe trāyagvalnam' (Tai. S. I. 3. 5 or Vāj. 8. V. 42) and strikes the tree with the are with the mantra 'O axe! do not injure it' ( svadhite mainam himsih,' Vāj. S. V. 42 and Tai. 8. I. 3.5). The first chip of the tree that is cut off, he keeps in a well-known place and the tree is out at such a low height from the ground that the stump left in the ground would not strike against the axle of a cart going that way. The tree should be so cut that it should not fall to the south ; it should fall to the east or north or north-east ( Ap. VII. 2. 7); when it is falling he repeats the mantra 'do not scratch the heaven with your top &o.' (Vaj. S. V. 43 or Tai. 8. I. 3.5). He offers ajya with the juhū on the stump of the tree with the mantra 'O tree, grow again with a hundred shoots' (Vaj. S. V. 43, Tai, S, I. 3. 5 ) and having touched one's body with 'may wo grow into a thousand branches' (ibid.) he outs off from tbe bottom upwards the twigs and knots of the felled. tree. There were several views about the length of the yüpe (Ap. VII. 2. 11-17, Kāt. VI. 1. 24-26). According to some the yāpa may be of any length from one aratni to 33 gratnis, but Kat. gives the usual length at 3 or 4 aratnia and Ap. (VII. 2. 17) also quotes the Sat. Br.(XI. 7. 4. 1) that the yüpa in nirudha pagubandha is three or four aratnis in length, while in Soma sacrifices the other measures may apply. Kāt. (VI. 1.31) states that in somayāga the yüpa may be from five to fifteen aratnis in length except 7, 10 or 14 aratnis and in the Vājapeya sacrifice the yüpa is 17 aratnis in length and in the Ašvamedha it is 21 aratnis. According to Ap. it must be in length at least as much as the height of the yajamāna or as much as the yajamāna with hands upraised. The girth of the yüpa is not fired. That part of the yüpa which is to be planted in the pit is called upara, which is not to be chiselled and which is about a 5th of the whole log but the rest of it is to be chigelled from the bottom towards the top 80 as to make the yüpa have eight angles and it should be somewhat tapering towards the top. One oorner or angle ( out of the eight ) should be more prominent than the rest and should face the fire. Out of the top portion of the 486 tree that remains after making the yūpa the carpenter prepares & wooden head-piece, eight-cornered and of the length of the hand from the wrist to the tips of the fingers and contracted in

the middle like a mortar. This piece is oalled caşala and is made hollow so as to fit in exactly on to the top of the yüpa like a turban and the peg-like top of the yüpa on which the caşala is fixed should protrude two or three angulas beyond the caşāla ( Kat. VI, 1. 30 ). 

The nirudhapasubandha oocupies two days, though it may be performed in one day. On the first of the two days called upavasatha '86 preliminary matters such as preparing the vedi, bringing the ydpa are performed. 

The vedi (a single one ) in the nirūdhapasubandha is prepared like the one in Varuna-pragbāsas to the east of the usual ābavaniya fire-place (and not to the west as in darka pūrņamāsa). The dimensions of the vedi are variously given, According to Ap. VII. 3. 7-9 the vedi is three or four aratnis on its western side, six aratnis in length from west to east and three aratnig on the eastern side and it is less in breadth 'towards the east or it is as wide as the axle on the west, of the length of the shafts of & cart and to the east as wide as that portion of a yoke which is between the outer holes thereof. On this vedi an uttaravedi ( a high altar ) is measured with the samyā 3487 (yoke-pin) on the eastern one-third of the vedi. From the northern corner of the eastern side ( the shoulder ) of the vedi, a pit called cātvāla is measured one samyā square about one prakrama to its north; it is dug with & spade taken with the mantra 'devasya ivā ...... adade' (Vaj. S. VI. I) and it is silently dug as deep as the knee or three vitastis ( 36 angu las ). The Tal. Br. I. 5. 10 gives the latter measure. The oātvāla is in front of the utkar& and a passage is left between the utkara and the catvala which is contiguous to the north side of the mabāvodi (vide Sat. Br. III. 5. 1. 24-30). The earth dug up is heaped on the uttaravedi thrice 2488 with the mantra

I. 16. 13 it is ono arm in longtb or 82 angulas, whilo com. on Kat. I. 3. 36 says it is ono span in loogth. Its thicker part is onllod kumbe.

I. 2. 12. 2); he breaks up the olods with the samyā, invokes the earth dug up, sprinkles it, spreads gravel on the earth so dug up and spread, pours down the remainder of the water contained in the prokşanl vessel to the north of the uttaravedi by means of a channel made with one stroke of the sphya and cements together the borders of the utta ravedi ( with water and earth). On the uttaravedi he makes & square hole ( called uttaranābhi) a span in measure or measuring as much as a bull's or horse's hoof, invokes it and sprinkles it with water and the rest of the water is drained off to the south (as water was drained off to the north above). Then he covers the uttaravedi with twigs of udumbara or plaksa tree and waits, if the pašubandha is so performed as to extend over two days. In the morning next day he pours clarified butter in a stream on the uttaravedi from the south-east corner to the north-west corner and from the south-west to the north-east carrying a golden piece in such a way that the butter will fall on the gold. Then he places three (pine ) paridhis ( enclosing stioks ) which are of kārsmarya wood ( according to Āp. VII. 7.7) round the nābhi in the west, south and north and puts down on the uttaravedi certain materials viz. bdellium, fragrant and appetising grass, bunch of white wool from between the horns of a ram ( petua ). Having kindled idhma ( a bunch of samidbs ) at the dhavaniya fire, he carries forward the kind led sticks (in & veggel) *489 which is supported on a vessel containing gravel ( to prevent the soorching of the hands ) to the uttaravedi and places them down on the nābhi over the bdellium and other things. This becomes the abavaniya for all actions in the pasubandha and the original Abavaniya becomes the gārhapatya.9490 

He takes a spade with a mantra (e. g. Vaj. S. VI. 1), draws to the east of the new ahavaniya an outline of the hole to be dug for inserting the yūpa. He digs a pit so deep that when the yüpa is erected therein its upara (the lower unchisel led portion) will not be exposed to view and he throws out to the east of the pit the earth dug out.

dug that it is partly within the vedi (prepared for pašubandha) and partly outside**(i. e. it is on the border). The yüpa la laid down in front of the pit, with its top to the east, is washed with water and sprinkled over with water in which barley grains have been mixed, a separate mantra ( ppthivyai tyd &o. as in Vaj. 8. V, 26 ) being recited when sprinkling the bottom, middle and top of the yüpa. He places a handful of kušas and the first chip ( that was cut off with the axe from the tree) on the yüpa which are both subsequently thrown into the hole, the ends of the kusas being towards the north and east; and then places to the north of the top of the yüpa the cagala. The rest of the water taken for sprinkling is poured into the hole for the yüpa with Sundhantam lokaḥ pitrşadanaḥ' (Vaj. S. VI. 1, Tai. 8. I. 3. 1.1) in which there is a reference to the world of the pitrs. He silently makes an offering of olarified butter in the hole with the sruva ladle. Then the adhvaryu or yaja māna sits to the south of the yüpa and anoints it with ordinary Ajys (over which no samskāra has been performed ) by mouns of a chip from its top to its bottom including all its angles ( but excluding the upara). Wbile the adhvaryu is doing this he issues a direction to the botę priest to repeat a verse for the yüpa that is being anointed249% and the hotę repeats' añijanti tvām'(Rg. III. 8.1) and stops when he has repeated half of it (AŚV. III. 1.8). Then the caşāla is anointed both inside and outside and placed on top of the yūpa with a mantra ( Vaj. S. VI. 2, Tai. 8. I. 2. 2. 3). Then that angular part of the yüpa which is to face the fire together with the corresponding part of the upara is anoint ed in a continuous stream and the adhvaryu touches all round and holds with his hand that part of the yūpe over which a girdle would be placed later on. At the direction of the adhvaryu the hotr priest repeats the verses Rg. IIL 8. 2-3, I. 36. 13-14 and III. 8. 5 (half), while the yüpa is being raised up. It is laid in the hole with a mantra (Vaj. 8.

He fills from left to right the hole for the yüpa with earth with 'brahmavanim tvā' (Vaj. VI. 3, Tai. 8. I. 3.6.2). The adhvaryu then strokes the earth tbrice with the staff of the maitrāvaruņa so as to make the ground round about the yüpa level with the rest of the ground with 'brahma dçmba kşatram dȚmba' (ibid) and sprinkles it with (ordinary) water all round. Two girdles of darbha are prepared one with two strands and two vyāmas'' in length (for the viotim) and the other with three strands and threa vyamas in length (for the yūpa). The yajamāng touches the yūpa and the adhvaryu makes him recite 'observe the exploits of Vişnu'(Rg. I. 22.19, Vāj. S. VI. 4, Tai. S.I.3.6.2) and look at the head-piece with

(VII. 11. 3 ) says that he takes in his hand the girdle for the yüpa with ' devasya tvā savituh' and rubs up the yüpa with the hand having the girdle therein with Rg. I. 22. 19. Then he begins to encircle the yūpe with the middle of the girdle at a spot which is of the same height as the navel of the sacrificer or in the middle of the yüpa. He calls upon the hot; to repeat Rg. III. 8. 4 ( yuvā guvāsā) when the yūpa is being encircled with the girdle. The girdle is passed round the yūpa in three coils from left to right. When he has finished doing it he repeatsparivir- asi'( Vāj. S. VI. 6, Tai. 8. I. 3. 6. 2). The two ends of the girdle are intertwined into one another and he inserts the tip of the girdle inside the loop at the other end. Ap. (VII. 11. 6-10) says that the girdle may be pushed down or higher up from the place indicated above or the ends may be dealt with differently according as the yajamāna desires rain or not or according as female or male progeny is desired for the yajamāna. To the north of the corner of the yüpa facing the ahavaniya he inserts in the middle or last coil of the girdle or in all coils of the girdle tho svaru.444 Jal.

and surrounding with a girdle ( parivyāņa or parivyayana ) are performed on the yüpa only once and are not repeated at each time an animal is sacrificed. The girdle is an anga of the yüpa and not of the pašu, as otherwise as many girdles will be required for the yūpa as the number of victims to be sacrificed in a gāga (vide Jal. IV. 4. 22-24). The svaru is connected As an anga with the victim (for anointing the victim with it) and not with the yüpa (Jai. IV. 4. 25-28 ). Vide Jai. IV. 2. 1-6 also. 

The animal to be sacrificed is bathed with goented water, is led between the cātvala and utkara and brought in front of the yūpe to the east with the animal's face to the west. The animal is a he-goat ( cbāga ) which must not have a broken horn and must not be devoid of an ear or eye or tooth or tail, must not be lame nor have only seven hoofs (instead of eight, as each of the feet has two hoofs). If the animal is defective in any one of these ways an expiatory offering of djya has to be made to Vişņu or Agni-Vişpu or Sarasvati or Bệhaspati (Ap. VII. 12.3). Then follows Pašūpākarana495 which may be done in two days. He takes a darbha blade other than from those spread on the vedi with 'upāvir-asi' (Vaj. S. VI. 7) and touches the animal ( that stands faoing the west) therewith with the verse 'near the gods' (upa devān, Vāj. 8. VI.7). Anotber way (according to Ap. VII. 1%. 5-8) is: he takes two blades of kusa reciting ' işe trā' (Tai. $. I. 1. 1.1) and takes a branch of plaksa tree that has many leaves and twigs, that is not dry at the end and is not hollow and touches the victim with the blades and the branch and repeate the two mantras 'upo devān-daivir-videb and prajapater-jayamāna' (Tai. S. I. 3. 7. 1 and III. 1.1.4) and the words 'I assign thee, who are dear to Indra and Agni."3486 Then he produces fire by churning from the aranis and offers homa in accordanoe with the procedure of the Vaisvadeva-parva (vide above pp. 1093.-94). Ap. (VII. 12. 11) says that upakarapa may be done after the production of fire. He makes a loop of the

S. VI. 8, Tai. S. I. 3. 8); and ties the rašana (girdle) round the yüpa towards its north with devasya tva' (Vaj. S. VI. 9 or Tai. S. 1. 3. 8.1). He sprinkles water over it with 'adbbyas-trauşadbibbyo' (Vaj. S. VI. 9). Then he makes the victim drink water (by holding below its mouth the agnihotra-havani filled with water) for the last time with 'apām perurasi' (Vāj S. VI. 10, Tai. 8. 1. 3.8.1). Then he sprinkles water over the upper limbs and lower limbs (such as its heart and belly) and over the whole of its body. Then he performs all the procedure of the dar$a-pürnamāsa beginning from the direction to the hot; to repeat a verse when the fire is being kindled up to the prayājas (i, e. the samidhe nis, pravara-varaps by the hot;, devatābvāna, āghāres and pravaravarana by the adhvaryu ). 

The pagu is meant either for Indra-Agni or Sürya or Prajapati and one has to dedicate the victim throughout one's life in every pasubandha to that deity which one ohooses at the first animal sacrifice ( Kāt. VI. 3. 29-30). He anoints the victim with ajya from the juhū ladle on its forehead, its shoulders and its bind parts after the last aghara is offered (as in darśa-pürņamāsa ) and before dhruva-samañjana (lad ling ājy& in the dhruvā ladle with the jubū thrice, once with & mantra and twice silently ). While the animal stands2497 he offers the pray&jas, that are eleven in the pasu. bandha ( while in darśapūrņamuisa they are only five and in cāturmāsyas they are nine ). The method of offering these in pasubandha is as follows: the adhvaryu directs the maitrāvaruņa to request the hot to repeat the yajya verses from the Apri hymns of the prayāja offerings in succession. The praişas (directions to the hotr) that the maitrā varuņa utters are rather lengthy and hence the text of only one is given below.2498 There are ten Apri hymns in the

Out of these in Rg. I. 13 and L 142 there are versos for both Tanūnapāt ( 2nd prayāja deity) and Narābamsa ; while Rg.

Yaska (in tho Nirukta VIII.4-22) holds a lengthy discussion on the Aprís, where ho appears to regard the Āprio as deities ; que S E I WT18: fra भाप्नोते. भीणार्धा । आप्रीभिरामीणातीतिमाक्षणम् । तासानिध्मः प्रथमागामी भवति । (Nir.

The word Āpri la here derived from the root pri' to please, while Yaska also suggests an altorpative derivation from Sp' to obtain but oites no Brühmada text in support of that derivation. The Sat.

Hence it is probable that he held the view that the Apri VOT805 for all persons should be taken from Rg. X. 110, while the Ait. Br. prefers the view that one should repost that Apri hymn that is escribed to the founder of one's gotra. Yaska (Nir. VIII. 22) divides the Apel bymes into three olasgos, those containing Vorsos addrossed to both Toninspāt and Narkdamon, those addrossed to Narfsathda only and

escribed to the founder of his gotra if he is from among these ten sages. The words of Asv. I. 5. 21-22 oreate some difficulty. Aøv. there presoribes that when uttering the yajya at the time of offering the 2nd praydja, the formula should contain an address to Tanūnapāt for all except for persons of Vasiştba, Sunaka, Atri, Vadbryašva and Rajanya gotras. These latter should utter a formula addressed to Narāšamsa. Here if * rajanya' refers to Visvāmitra, then the difficulty is that in the Aprl hymn (III. 4) ascribed to him, the 2nd deity is Tanūnapat and not Narābamsa ; but it is possible tbat the word 'rdjanya' stands for a kşatriya sacrificer in general and does not refer to Visvāmitra gotra at all. After ten prayājas are offered, the adhvaryu says to the slaughterer of the victim' bring your two-edged knife.' The adhvaryu takes the svaru (chip of wood) and anoints the svaru and one edge of the knife with the clari fied butter from the bill-like (or spout-like ) part of the juhü ladle ( according to Āp. VII. 14. 10 the svaru is anointed thrice) and holding the svaru below the knife touches with both the head of the victim (forehead, according to Kat. VI.5.12 ) with a mantra (Vāj. S. VI. 11, Tai. S. I. 3.8.1). After placing back the svaru whence it was taken the adhvaryu gives the knife back to the slaughterer (Samitr) with the words 'let this edge be marked by you'(Sat. Br. III. 8.1.5). The animal when killed is out up by the slaughterer with the un-anointed edge and the flesh when roasted is cut up with the edge that is anointed. The adhvaryu directs the maitrāvaruņa to recite a mantra for indicating that fire ( a fire-brand) is being carried round the victim and the maitrāvaruņa recites 'agnirhota no' (Rg. IV. 15. 1) or the verses Rg. IV. 15.1-3 (according to Āśv. III. 2.9). To the north of the cātvala pit, he digs up a spot for establishing the

Samitra fire.900 The Agnidhra, lighting & fire-brand at the Ahavaniya, carries it thrice round the victim, the yüpa, the Ahavaniya fire, the place where the dāmitra fire is to be kindled, the otvāla pit and the clarified 2001 butter, from left to right with the mantra pari vājapatih kavih' (Rg. IV. 15. 3, Tai. 8. IV. 1, 2.5). In modern times the priest perambulates all these together and not separately. The āgnidbra throws the firebrand on to the Ahavaniya fire and again goes round the above objects thrice from right to left. According to Ap. VII. 15. 4-6, the adhvaryu makes one, two, three or four offer ings of ajya, with mantras called apāvya, when fire is carried round the victim, when it is set free from the yüpe and led on (Tai. S. III. 1. 4. 1-2). The agnidhra, again taking up the same fire-brand, starts to go with his face to the north and the victim is led after the agnidhra by the samitr ( who takes away the cord of girdle from the victim's head and ties it round its neck). The pratiprastbātr ( an assistant of adhvaryu ) touches the animal (that is being led northward ) from behind with two utensils ( spits) made of kārsmarya wood ( used for roasting vapa, omentum ), the adhvaryu touches the pratipra sthāte and the sacrificer touches the adhvaryu.250X A pit ia got dug (by a servant) for covering in it the undigested food and the fooes of the victim when killed. They (the priests and yajamins ) should not pass beyond the place for the samitra fire. The adhvaryu takes two kusa blades from those with which the vedi is strewn and says to āgnidhra '03śrā3 vaya' 

2500. The fire on which the flesh of the victim is roasted is called Simitra.

and the latter replies 'astu srau3şat' and then the adhvaryu issues an upapraiņa (a supplementary direction) to the mai trāvaruņa to prompt (the hots) to recite for the offerings to Gods.403 The hotr then recites the famous (but long) adhrigur praiga, "of which is an invocation to divine and human slaugh

(III. 3. 2 and 4) provides that the worde शामितार:, अपाप and अस्मा रक्षः संसजतात् are recited inaudibly and the Passage 'अधिगो ....... अपाप' is repeated thrice. This whole formula is called adhrigu sod adbrigu was also supposed to be a deity presiding ovor the slaughtering of a victim in Bacrifice. Vide com. on Abv. III. 2. 11. There were as remarked by Sai. Sr. aine pauses to take breath at the end of eacb of the first nige sontences. Tho Nirukto (V.11)oxplains 'adhrigu' as meaning a mantra and also states that the word is applied to Agni in Rs. III. 21.4 and to Indra in Rs. I. 61. 1. The Nirukta quotes the words 'अधिगो शमा ...... अभिगो.' Jaimini considers questions arising from some of the words used in this formula ; in IX. 3. 27-28 (when there are many viotims in a saorifico, the singular: 'caksur' is still to be used), Ix. 3. 29-31 (the word

terers calling upon them to bring the animal to the holy doors of the sacrificial place, wishing that the parents, relatives and friends of the victim will consent to its death and expres sing the hope that its several organs and limbs, such as the eyes and ears, will be merged in divinities like the sun and giving directions as to how its parts are to be cut and disposed of. On reciting this solemn formula the hot;, while still occupying his seat, turns to the right (i. e. he comes to face the west) and has the sacrificial place behind his back and the maitrāvarupa does the same. The adhvaryu throws one of the two blades taken up by him to the west of the samitra fire, the victim is held over that blade with its head to the west (or to the east, according to Kāt. VI. 5. 17) and feet to the north. Then its mouth is firmly held so as to stop its breathing and choke it to death or it is strangled to death without allowing it to give out a ory, by using & halter round its throat. The adhvaryu says 'kill it without 980s allowing it to utter a ory' and then he along with the pratiprasthātr, āgnidhra and the sacrificer come back to the ahavaniya which they face, turn from left to right and remain with their backs to the animal that is being killed (i. e. they, do not see the actual slaying of the animal). According to Ap. VII. 16. 7 tbe sacrificer repeats at this time several verses such as Tai. S. III. 3. 1. 2, Tai. Br. III, 7.7, the purport of which is that the viotim may go to heaven, the sacrificer himself also may go to heaven after securing welfare in this world. When the samitr declares that the viotim is killed the adhvaryu says 'let, it lie down for a moment.' If the pašu bleats while being strangled the adhvaryu then offers

ajya in fire (as an expiation). The sacrificer and adhvaryu with vapaśrapanis (spits ) approach the dead victim with the words 'O slaughterers, may you approach'(Tai. 8. III. 1, 4.3). He then removes the cord (by which the victim was tied) with *may Aditi remove this cord' (Tai. S. III. 1, 4.%). He winds round the rašanā (girdle of the victim ) into a loop, keeps it on the arteries of the victim leading to the ears, attaches it to a peg and throws it into the catvala pit (Ap. VII. 17. 4-6). Accord ing to Kāt. VI. 5. 26 he throws the tying oord into the cātvala by means of the two vapāśrapanis. Then the adhvaryu directs the pratiprasthātr to lead forward the sacrificer's wife from her seat to the vedi. When leading her who has & jar of water in her hands for washing the feet and other limbs of the pašu, the priest*s06 makes her recite a verse in honour of the sun.namas te atana' (Vaj. S. VI. 12, Tai. S. I. 3. 8. 2). Ap. adds that the wife, priests and the sacrificer touch water on the cātvala pit (VII. 18. 4) with a mantra (Tai, S. I. 3, 8, % 'apo devib ). The wife sitting down near the dead pasu washes with water the several parts of the victim's body viz its mouth, nose, eyes, navel, ponis, anus, feet ( all together ) with appropriate formulae in each case (viz. 'vācam te sundhāmi' &o. Vaj. S. VI. 14). With the water remaining in the jar the adhvaryu and sacrificer sprinkle the other parts, such as the head, with Vāj. VI, 15 (Tai. 8. I. 3.9.1). The adhvaryu turns the animal on its back and places on the victim's body a blade of kuģa with its end to the east about four fingers%50% below the navel of the animal with 

oşadhe trdyasya' (Vaj. S. VI. 15 ), places the marked edge of the knife on that blade, makes & slit on the kuśa blade and the belly obliquely, takes in his left hand the portion of the blade cut off and anoints the ends of the other portion of the blade with blood ( that spirts out from the slit) with thou art the portion of evil spirits' (Vaj.

The adh varyu then pulls out from the belly of the viotim the omentum, envelopes the two spits 2510 ( vapašrapanis ) with it, pierces the thin end of the vapa with one spit, severs it from the belly on all sides and sprinkles it with water holding the spits over the patvāla pit. Then the pratiprasthātr heats the omentum on the samitra fire. The adhvaryu, pratipras. thats and Agnidhra come from the otvāla to the aha vaniya. The Agnidhra throws the samitra fire (viz. the firebrand and not the fire produced by attrition) into the Dhavaniya and the adhvaryu also throws into it the portion of the blade hold in his left hand ( as stated at p. 1123 above). Ap. ( VII. 19. 3) adds that the samitr holds tigbtly by the closed fingers of his hands the two portions of the skin of the victim's belly till the omentum is offered into fire. The pratiprasthātę, standing to the north of the āhavaniya fire, heats the omentum on that fire, then carries it by the space between the yüpa and @havaniya, goes round to the south side, and roasts the omentum on the dhavaniya. The adhvaryu takes clarified butter in the sruva ladle and pours ajya on the omentum that is being held for roasting on the ābavaniya by the pratiprasthātr with a mantra. When drops ( stokas) of fat begin to drip from the omentum, the adhvaryu directs the maitrā varuņa to recite for the drops. The maitrāvaruņa recites Rg. I. 75. 1. and Rg. III. 21. 1-5.8511 When the omentum is well roasted, the pratiprasthātę says to the adhvaryu 'it is roasted, proceed. The omentum is placed on the south corner of the western side ( śropi ) of the vedi on a branch of plakņa tree stretched on the barhis ( kusa grass on the vedi).

X. 8. 5 and some others the ajyabhāgas are not offered in independent animal sacrifices nor in the animal sacrifice ih" soma-yaga, Āp. VII. 20. 8) he puts ajya in the jubü ladle, places a piece of gold thereon, then the whole omentum on that plece (taking it from the spits ), places another golden piece on the omentum, on which he pours ājya. 5518 The adhvaryu then offers into the abavaniya the omentum so treated to Indra and Agni (or Sürya or Prajāpati as stated above on p. 1117). The anuvāky& and yājyk' of the vapā are respectively Rg. I. 93. 1 and 5. According to Aøv. III. 4. 4. the pradūnas ( yāgas ) in all pagu bandhas are three, viz. vapā, purodada and havis. After offering Vapā, the adhvaryu throws, while standing to the north, into the ahavadiya the vapaérapapi spits, the one with two forks having the forks in the east and the other having its point turned to the west ( according to Ap. VII. 21. 3 it is the prati prasthātr who does this ). The adhvaryu 'offers on the spite the samsrāva ( the drippings ). Āp.( VII, 21. 5) and some other sutras presoribe that the fee of one bull and three miloh oows or three other cows is given to the priests at this stage. The priests ( six ), the sacrificer and his wife go out to the cityāla and there purify themselves by mārjana ( purifying with drops of water) with idamāpaḥ pravahata,' *$14 Vāj. S. VI. 17 and Rg.

Now preparations are to be made for the pasu-purodāsa2815 and the necessary utensils are placed to the east of the ahavs niya (the former āhavaniya i.e. the gārhapatya in this sacrifice) on kusa grass by the agnidhra. The devatā of the purodāsa is the same as the devata of the victim i. e. Indra and Agni (vide

p. 1117 above ). Jal. (XII. 1. 1-8) prescribes that the proce dure (viz. prayðjas ) performed at the time of offering vapa is not to be repeated when the pasupurodaśa is offered. The adhvaryu separates the various organs ( such as the heart, the tongue) from the corpse without cutting into parts each organ (according to the com. on Ap. VII. 22.5 and 7 it is the samitr who outs up the several limbs). There is some divergence as to the limbs of the victim that are out off and are used as avadānas and since animal sacrifices became rare or were altogether stopped in medieval times, the commentators do not explain all the words used in the ancient texts in the same way (vide Āp. VII. 22. 6, Kāt. VI. 7. 6-12 and Baud. IV. 8). Accord ing to Āp. VII. 22. 6,8510 the limbs out off are: the heart, the tongue, ohost, the liver, the kidneys ( vškyau, vřkkau in Kāt. ), left forefoot, the two flanks ( pārøve), the right haunch, a third part ( i. e. the middle one) of the entrails these are meant for the dovatās and are to be offered with the juhű ladle ; the right fore-foot, the left baunch, the thinnest third of the entrails--these are for sviştakệt; the kloman (the right lung ? )8517, plihan ( the spleen), puritat ( pericardium ? ), adhyüdhni (& tubular vessel above the udder ), vanişthu (large entrails ?), medas (fat), jāghanı$18 (the tail). Kat. VI. 

2616. According to Kat. VI. 7. 6 it is the foremost (or upper) joint (purvagadaka ) of the left forefoot ( that is taken ) among the first aine. Kat. VI. 7.6. describes the first nino 88 jauhavam (to be offered with the juba ) and the next three as 00nnected with upabbit ladle. The threo cut into upabhrt are called tryanga and are meant for Svitakit. Vide Sat. Br. III. 8. 3. 18 (8. B. E. Vol. 26 p. 205 ). The whole of the entrails are taken off at once and divided only at the time of cutting and putting into the juba ladle.

7.11 adds that kloman and the next three may be out off or not. The medas ( fat on the abdomen) is, according to Kat., thrown on the guda (entrails) if the victim be thin. The tail is to be employed as an offering in the Patnisamyāja, according to Kat. and the largest part of the intestines ( 3rd of the whole ) was to be employed as offering in upayaj homa. The undigested grass (inside the belly of the victim ) is put in & pit dug up to the west of the gāmitra fire and to the north of the utkara and on it the blood of the victim is poured with the words 'thou art the portion of evil spirits' (Vaj. S. VI. 16 ). The victim's heart is held pierced on a pike (dūla) made of varana wood one aratni long and is roasted on the samitra fire and all other parts of the victim except the heart are cooked in an ukhā (pot for boiling or cooking). According to com. on Ap. VII. 22. 9 this cooking is done by the samits. Jai. XII. 1. 12 prescribes that the cooking is done on the salāmukblys fire and not on simitra fire. The adhvaryu performs the operation of sprinkling butter on the juhū and upabhrt, outs two portions from the middle and front parts of the cooked material into the juhů, pours butter over it and offers it into fire for Indra and Agni, then cuts one portion ( for Sviştakst) into the upabbft, makes two pourings of butter over it and makes an offering to Agni Sviştakst.2519 Jai. (XII. 1. 10-11 ) concludes that the offering of the pahupurodāsa is made with the ladles. used in darśapūrņamāsa and not with the soma vessels ( viz, the oups and camasas). Then a portion is cut off out of the remainder of the material from which purodāsa was offered and placed in & vessel called prasitrabarana ( which portion of the sacrificial food is eaten by the brahmā priest ) and some portion is cut off as the idā, which is invoked with mantras and eaten by all the priests. He then thrice asks the samity whether tho havis (the heart roasted on a pike) is ready cooked and the latter simply replies "it is cooked', Kat, VI. 8. 1 presoribes that the samitr should in his reply utter only the word 'sptam' and should not add any word like 'revered sir' (bhagavah) or 'hi'.

takes off the heart from the pike ( sola) on which it was ross ted, and keeps it in a pot (kumbhi) and pours over it prşadājya (olarified butter in which sour milk is mixed) with 'sap te' (Vaj. S. VI. 18, Tai. 8. I. 3. 10. 1) and ajya over the other portions of the pašu. The samitr gives the hțdaya-sula (the pike on which the heart was roasted ) to the adhvaryu who does not keep it on the bare ground nor throw it in water, nor does he touch with it himself or others (but holds it tied by & cord). He takes these ( viz. the roasted heart and the cooked organs ) between the yüpa and the ahavaniya fire and places them on the southern part of the altar (viz. its southern corner of the Western side ) over which kuģa grabs is already spread. Then ajya is sprinkled over four utensils viz. juhű, upabhịt, vasca homahavaņi (& suc ladle with which the offering of vasā i. 6. of the gravy is to be made ) and the vessel in which ida is to be cut. Then a golden piece is placed in the juhū and the upabhst, which are then kept on twigs of plakşa tree and then in the juhū and upabhrt are out by the pratiprasthātr ( with the anointed edge of the knife ) portions of the heart, then of the tongue and then of the chest ( this order is stated in the Tai. S. VI. 3. 10) and then of the other limbs in any order (the whole of the entrails being at this stage cut in three parts ). Two portions of the size of the fore-part of the thumb are out both in the juhū ( of the daivata limbs ) and upabhrt ( of the limbs meant for Sviştakit ). While this is being done the. adhvaryu directs the maitrāvaruņa to repeat texts for the havis that is to be offered to Manota and the maitrāvaruņa repeats the whole bymn Rg. VI. 1 (in the first of whioh only the word Manotā ocours as an epithet of Agni, probably meaning "thinker). He takes the gravy in the vasāhomahavanza520 with red-asi' (Vāj. S. VI. 18), pours ajys over it twice and mizes the two together with the knife. The rest of the vasi he pours in the idāpātra to which are

added the chest and other boneless parts.881 When the yajy. for Indra-Agni is half repeated, a part of the Vasa is offered by the pratiprasthātsitting to the north into fire with 'ghștam ghftapāvānah' (Vaj. 8. VI. 19, Tai. 8. 1. 3. 10.2) and with the remainder of the vasā he makes offerings in each direction with 'digaḥ pradisah' (Vaj. S. VI. 19, Tai. S. I. 3. 10,2). No vasa is kept for being partaken of by the priests ( com. on Kāt. VI. 8. 22). Then the adhvaryu takes in the juhū a part of prşadajya (mottled butter) from the pot of prşadajya and offers to Vanaspati and after taking the contents of the upa bhrt into the juhū makes the offering to Sviştakrt (Ap. VII. 25. 14 and Kāt. VI. 8. 18-22 state that the order of these last offerings may be different). Then he touches the remaining organs and limbs of the pabu and keeps the juhů and upabhșt in their places. Then the idd (to be eaten by the priests ) is brought between the yüpa and the ahavaniya fire. After the idą is invoked the six priests and the sacrificer partake of it, but there are special portions assigned to each viz. the vanişthu is given to the agoidhra, the adhyüdhni to the hotr and the chest to brahmā. Then they all purify themselves by mārjana. The adhvaryu then directs the dgnidhra 'bring burning coals for upayaj offerings', directs the pratiprasthat ( called upayastr 8523 here ) to attend to the coals; to the brahma 

2521. The wholo animal is the sacrificial material (just as rice grains are the material from which caru is prepared for offering ) and havis is constituted by the heart and other organs of the animal. Vide com, on Kat. VI. 8. 6 and Jai. X. 7. 1-2. The several organs and parts are taken out of the ukha and spread over a large bamboo vessel (varda-patrr ), the last part being placed in the north. Tho adhvarya porforms on each of the oloven limbs (called jaubava ) pranadana (vivifioation) while no pripadana is done for the portions to be offered to Sviptakft. According to Āp. VII. 24. 5 only ono portion is out from the limbs meant for Sviaţakpt. Several rules are laid down in Āp. VII. 24. 6–19 about the cutting of some parts. Out of the three parts of the ontrails, one of medium thickness is out in two and placed among the daivata portions, the thinnest part being for sviptakşt; the medas is out in thros parts, two being put in the two srucs and the third in tbeido patra. The modas is mixed in tbe broth of the victim's limbs. The ida is made from tho first six out of the limbs (heart &c.) and the vanisthu is the 7th. The ida is incroased by the addition of the limbs that bave no bones viz. kloman, spleen and puritat. 

2522. According to com. on Āp. VII. 26. 8 the hot is the upayapti. According to Jai XII, 4, 8 this offering of the entrails is samskara (pratipattikarma ) and when many victims aro sacrificed in one rite, tho entrails of all animals aro offered as upaydja offerings.

priest he says 'shall I start' and also directs the Agnidhra to place a samidh on the fire. The Agnidhra brings red-hot goals from the samitra fire, and puts them down on the northern corner of the west side of the altar after removing the kušas strewn thoreon ( in soma the coals may be optionally brought from the agnidhriya fire-place and placed on hotdhişnya ). The third and thickest part of the entrails ( that has been kept aside ) is cut obliquely into eleven parts, which are offered into the red-hot coals placed as above by the pratiprasthātz with his right hand, each with a mantra (for eleven mantras vide Vāj. 8. VI. 21, Tai. S. I. 3. 11. 1), when the ory Vaugat is uttered for each of the eleven anuyājas 2538 that are offered with prşadājya here ( Ap. VII. 26. 12). These eleven offerings of the entrails are called upayājas (additional offerings), vide Jai. XII. 4. 8. At the end of the 11th offering, the pratipras thatę touches his mouth and the portion stioking to his hand is wiped on the barhis with the words 'adbhyastvauşadhibhyah' (Tai. S. I. 3. 11). At the end of the anuyājas, the svaru is placed in the juhū ladle and offered into fire with 'may thy smoke reach the sky, may thy flame reach heaven, fill the earth with thy ashes, svāhāl'(Vaj. S. VI. 21, Ap. VII. 27.4). Ap. (VII. 27.6-7) and others say the direction ( praişa ) for repeating the sūktavaka is uttered by the maitrāvaruņa25(and not by the adhvaryu). The hotę repeats it and the maitrāverupa throws his staff into the übavaniya fire ( Āøy. III. 6. 21 ) and Ap. (VII. 27. 8 ) says that the three paridhis also are thrown into fire by means of the sruos except the dhruva. The patnisamydja is performed with the tail of the animal, which is taken to the south of the sacri ficial ground. There was a difference of opinion whether portions of the tail were offered to all the four deities of patni gamyāja 3585 or to some only ( vide Kāt. VI. 9. 14-20 ). Accor ding to Ap. (VII. 27. 10 ) and Kat. (VI. 9. 15-19 ) only ajya offerings are made to Soma and Trastr, the inside part of the tail ( on which no hair grow) is cut up for the wives of the gods and the hairy part is cut up for Agni Gșhapati.

the sacrifioer is caturavattin or pancūvattin, all four or five por tions are cut off from the tail and there is no under layer (upastarana) and upper layer (abhighérapa) of ajya in this case. Acoording to Kāt. VI. 9. 20 portions of the tail are offered to all devatās of patnisamyāja. Vide Jai. XII. 4. 10-16 and III. 3. 20-23 on this. Ida is cut from the hairless portion of the tail for hot; and from the hairy portion for the agnidhra and the rest of the tail is handed over to the sacrificer's wife who passes it on to the adhvaryu or some brahmana, The samitr had so far partaken of nothing, but he is now given the shoulder of the victim, but if he be not a brāhmaṇa he gives it to a brahmana. They offer three samiştayajus, e538 throw the barhis into fire, approach & pond ( or reservoir of water ) taking with them the spit (süla ) on which the heart was roasted. Ap. VII. 27. 15 says that they carry&827 the süla in such a way as not to touch it. The adhvaryu enters in the midst of the water and conceals the spit into the bottom underneath with its tip downwards with the mantra 'thou art sorrow; give him gorrow who hateth us and whom we hate' (Tai. S. I. 3.11. 1-2 and also with Vāj, S. VI. 22 according to Kāt. VI. 10. 3), at the same time thinking of his enemy (without taking his name ). If he does not enter water, then he may pour some water to the east of the yüpa and should conceal the spit at the place where the dry space and wet space meet. Ašv. (III. 6. 25-26 ) prescribes that all the priests, the sacrificer and the wife do not touch the süla after it is thrust into the earth, do not look at it, and return, each taking one after another three fuel-sticks with a mantra for each and put them on fire with & mantra for each stick one after another, after doing homage to the ahavaniya with Rg. I. 23. 23. Then they all perform mārjana near the concealed sāla or the cātvala with 'sumi. triyā na āpa osadhayah' (Tai, S. I. 4. 45. 2 ) or according to Kat. VI. 10.5 they touch water with 'dhāmno ... ... sumitriya na Apah' (Vaj. 8. VI. 22). Then they pray Varuņa to free them from sin in the words 'dhāmno dhāmno rājan' (Tai, S. I. 3. 11, %), and 'ud-uttamam' (Tai. 8. I. 5. 11,3 ). They lay samidhs on the ahavaniya as in Varupapraghāsa. The animal sacrifice ends with the garnsthājapa as in darsapūrpamāsa,

sacrifices are found in the texto prescribed for the attainment of such objects as prosperity, villages, eloquence &o. Tai. 8. (II. 1.1-10) refers to several such sacrifices. For example, Tai. S. II. 1. 1. 1 says 'one who is desirous of prosperity should offer a white pasu to Vāyu; one who is desirous of a village should sacrifice an animal to Vayu Nigutvat; one who having command over speech or words is not able to speak eloquently should offer an ewe to Sarasvati' (II. 1. 2.6). The Tai. Br. ( II. 8. 1-9 ) contains the anuvākyās and yājyās of the vapa, purodasa and havis offerings of many animal sacrifices. Ap. (XIX. 16-17) deals with kamya animal sacrifices. Ašv. III. 7 gives the anuvakyās and yājyās of a group sacrifice (Aika dašina) of eleven animals 2538 to Agni, Sarasvati, Soma, Pūşan, Bphaspati, Vi ve Devas, Indra, Maruta, Indra-Agni, Savit, and Varuņa ; while Āāv. III, 8. 1 sets out the anuvākys and yājyās of eighteen animal sacrifices in addition, 

Those follow the procedure of the nirudhapaśubandha Bacrifice and are all passed over here. 

2628. The Aikadagina animal sacrifice is a special form of the animal sacrifice, for wbich Ap. XIV. 5-7 may be consulted. It follows the procedure of savaziya pabu (Jai. VIII. 1. 14). In this thero may be thirteen yūpas for cloven pagus or only one yüpa for all pašus. Bleven yüpas are the ordinary onos, the 12th is called upasaya, the whole of which is chiselled, but is not implanted in a pit like the othors; it lies near the yupa to the south; the 13th is oalled patnīvate and it is not highor then the gavel when imbedded in the ground. The yüpas are so arranged as to rise on the south sido i. e. the southern-most is the tallast of all. The padu tied to the pātnirate is meant for Traptr, bat it is lot off and ajya is offered. Jai, (II. 3. 19 ) concludes that when the Vedio toxt says "after carrying fire round the patnlvata victim, it is let off', only a special matter is laid down concerning the pātnfvata victim. Ho further says (in IX. 4. 56-60 ) that the djya offered is not * substitute for tho viotim, but is a separate rite in which the deity is the demo, Vide Kat. VIII. 8. 27 ff. If there bo moro yupas than one, thon the situoktras from anjana to parivyapA (surrounding with a girdlo) are all to be done on one, then on anothor and so on. Vido Jai. V. 2. 7-9.

Sacrifices are often divided for convenience into ieti, pasu and soma. Acoording to Gaut. VIII, 21 and Lat. Sr. V. 4. 24 there are seven forms of some sacrifices, viz. Agniştoma, Atyagnistoma, Ukthya, Sodasin, Vājapeya, Atiratra and Aptor yāma. The Agniştoma is the model (prakrti) of all soma sacrifices. The Agnistoma is a one day (alkābika or ekāba ) sacrifice and it is an integral part of the Jyotiştoma so much so that the two are often identified. Soma sacrifices are classi fied into those that are finished in one day (and so called okāba ), those that are celebrated for more than one day up to twelve (and so called ahina ), those that extend over more than twelve days ( and are called Sattra ). The dvādaśaha is both & sattra and an absna.8530 The Jyotistoma ocoupies generally five days and the chief rites performed on these days are: (1) choosing of priests, madhuparka, dikşaniyești, consecration of the sacrificer (dikşā ); (2nd day) Prāyapiya işti ( i. e, opening işti ), purchase of soma, atitheyesti ( işçi offering hospitality to Boma ), Pravargya 2581 Upasad ( homage twice a day in the morning and evening); (3rd day) Pravargya and Upabad twice again ; (4th day) Pravargya and Upasad, Agniprapayana, Agnisomapranayana, havirdhāna-pranayana, animal sacrifice; (5th day called sutya or savaniya) pressing of soma, offering it and drinking it in the morning, mid-day and evening, the udayaniga (concluding işti), avabhștha (final purificatory bath).

Agniştoma is presented, derived from the principal Śreuta sātras, Jai. in VI. 2. 31 declares that the performance of Jyotiştoma is obligatory on all members of the three higher varpas, just as upanayana is, since the word brahmana in Tai. 8. VI. 3. 10.5 (a brahmana when born comes charged with three debts ) is only illustrative. Agniştoms is so called because in it Agni is praised or because the last chant ( stotra ) is addressed to Agni.8878 It is to be performed in vasanta ( spring ) every year and on the New Moon or Full Moon day (Ap. X. 2. %, 5 and 8, Kat. VII. 1. 4 and Sat. VII. 1 p. 562 ). The general view ex pressed in Jai. IV. 3. 37 was that one should perform & soma sacrifice after baving performed darsapūrņamāsa, cāturmāgyas and pašu sacrifice, but some held that it could be performed even before darka-pürnamāsa, but after agnyadhana (Aøv. IV. 1. 1-% and Sat. VII. 1. p. 556 ). Jai. (V, 4.5-9) also states this As the view of some. Jaimini, however, declares that all modi fioations of the Agnigtoma must be performed after one has begun to perform darsapūrpamāsa ( V. 4. 26 ). The intending sacrificer sends a person called somapravāka ( inviter to officiate at a soma sacrifice) to invite brāhmaṇas who are thorough masters of the Veda, neither too young nor too old, with clear and loud voices and not deficient in any limb (Tapdya Br. 1 1.1, Drāhyāyapa Śr. I. 1. 10, Ap. X. 1. 1). He invites the principal four or all the 16 (or 17, including sadasya') priests ( stvrij ), who make inquiries whether some other person has refused the office and whether the fee will be excellent. Those portions of the choosing mantras are uttered inaudibly wherein the priests are invoked as if they were divinities and the portion asau mānuşaḥ or tvam mānu şah is uttered loudly, 4518 When the priests come madhuparku is offered to them. The sacrificer goes to the king ( of the country ) to ask for a sacrifi. cial ground ( devayajana ), even if he has one already, with the formula'god Varuņa, give me devayajana , 25%* This is a mere

form, but even the king has to make a similar request (in his case ) to the hots and other priests. The requirements of a proper devayajana have already been given above (p. 988n). In the western portion of the devayajana from which all roots are uprooted, & pavilion 1535 (vimita, & four-cornered mandapa ) is erected, the central ridge and the covering bamboos of whicb run from west to east, which has doors ( two oubits wide ) in all directions and which slightly inclines towards the east, or a rectangular house (šala ) may be built, twenty aratnis long and ten aratnis wide ( Kat. VII. 1. 19-25, Āp. X. 5. 1-5, Baud. VI. 1). A shed for cooking the vrata food is erected to the south of the pavilion and another to the west for the patni ( wife of the sacrificer). The sacrificer while in his house implants his gārbapatya and abavaniya fires on the araṇis with a mantra "ayam te yonih'( Vāj. 8. III. 14., Tai. S. I. 5.2), comes to the devayajapa, enters ( along with the priests and bis wife ) the mandapa by the eastern door with the granis in his hand, and touches the central post of the pavilion. The things that are required ( sambhāraḥ ) 8586 are also brought to the pavilion. In the pavilion a vedi is prepared and fires are establisbed after being produced by attrition. Offerings of ajya with the sam bharayajus formulas (Tai. A. III. 8), with the sapta-hot, formulas (Tai. A. III. 5) are made and also & yüpabuti is offered. Outside the pavilion to its north the sacrificer gets the hair on the head, arm-pits and on the face out by a barber in a tont covered with mata, pares the nails of his hands first of the right band first from the small finger) and then of the feet. Jal. ( III. 8. 3-11 ) establishes that it is the sacrificer (and not the adhvaryu ) who pares his nails, cuts his hair, brushes his teeth, subsists on milk. Sat. VII. 1. p. 587 states that the nails of the left hand are pared first and then of the right hand. He brushes his teeth with an udumbara twig, then he bathes in & reservoir of water or in 8 kunda after putting a golden piece in it with mantras, performs doamana and drinks water as a consecration, 

2686. Tho pavilion is called programda or pr&cinavanda and according to some it is 16 prakramas long (from west to oust ) and 12 prakramas wide (from south to north). It may have four or five (ono in the north-east) doors and a portures in the four quarters. Vide Āp. X. 5.5.

All these from paring nails (oalled apsu-dikşi ) 18 except the cutting of hair are also undergone by the wife at the instance of the pratiprasthātę priest (but without mantras ). The adhvaryu hands over a fine silken fresh garment to the gaori fioer which the latter wears. In the afternoon in the prāgvamsa he partakes of food (rice ) \#588 mixed with ghee and sprinkled over with ourds and honey or whatever iso liked by him. The wife also does the game. He takes up butter (navanita ) with two bunches of darbha grass and smears himself thrice with them beginning from the face. He applies collyrium with a darbha blade twice to the right eye and once to the left or thrice to both. The adhvaryu performs the purification (pavana) of the sacrificer outside the prāgvarsa to its north by three bunches of geven darbhas esch rubbed twice over his body above the navel and once below the navel with mantras and the sacrificer algo mutters mantras. The wife also does all this (smearing the body with butter, applying añjana and purifica tion) without mantras at the instance of the pratiprasthātr. The sacrificer enters the pavilion by the eastern door and the wife by the western and ocoupy their respective seats. Then follows diksapiya işti 8539 whioh is so called because it effects & samskāra in the man intending to sacrifice and because after it is performed he is entitled to be called 'dikşita'. The conolu alon in Jai. V. 3. 29-31 is that a man becomes a dikşita at the end of the dikşapiya işti and has thenoeforward to observe the rules laid down for ā dikşita and that one does not become a dikşita by being given the staff or the girdle &o. At first six abutis called dikşāhutis are offered, four with djya taken from the dhruva into the sruva, 5th with the bruo and the sixth is oalled pārpabuti and is offered with sruo (in which twelve ladl ings with aruva have been made ). Thege six abutis are called * audgrahaņa '( Ap. X. 8.7 and com. on Sat. VII. 1. p. 591 ) or 'audgrabhana'( Kat. VII. 3. 16 ). In the dikşapiya işti a cake

2538. According to some the meal takes place before the cutting of hair (vide Āp. X. 6. 10).

Several matters that occur in the model işti (such as observing & vrata, the girding up of the wife, outting off & portion for yojamāna, phalikaranahoma, cooking anvāhārya rice as fee for the priesta, samiştayajus) are omitted in this işti (Baud. VI. 3 mentions ten matters that are omitted, Ap. X. 4. 12, Sat. VII. 1. p. 575). According to Jai. VIII. 1. 3-10 the several actions done in the model işti are not to be extended to somayāga unless the vedio texts expressly say 80, and Jai. X. 1.4 establishes that there is no ārambhaniya işti in dikşanlyd and other iştis of somayāga, The dikşanly, onds with the patnisamyājas and the eating of the 2nd idā (Sat. VII. 1. p. 578). Certain rules are laid down about the pitch of the voice in the several rites. According to Ap. X. 4. 9 everything is said inaudibly till the agnisomlya rite. According to Kāt. (VII. 2. 31-32) the voice reaches the highest pitch in the dikşaniya işti, the mantras in the prāyaniya and atithyā iştis are in a lower tone than in the dikşanlyi and the upasad mantras are repeated inaudibly. The dikşā (consecration) of the sacrificer and his wife proceeds as follows.a540 To the south of the dhavaniya two black antelope hides (or one if two are not available) with the neck portion to the east are spread on the altar with the hairy part outside. He (the priest ) site to the west of the antelope skin bending his right knee; the saori ficer touches the white and black spots (or the line that joins them, Kat. VII. 3. 23), then creeps upon the hide with bis right knee bent and sits down on the western side of the hide. The sacrificer ties round his waist above the garment worn by him a girdle of three strands made of hemp and muñja grass, covers his right shoulder with a fresh garment and folds round his head a piece of cloth, he is given the horn of a black ante lope about & span in length with three or five folds (from left to right), which he ties to the hem of his garment (or in the corner of his upper garment).

his body he does so with that horn. Jai. (XI. 4. 48-49 ) declares that the mantra is to be repeated only once even if the yajamāna feels the desire to scratch several parts of his body at the same time. The adhvaryu gives & staff of udum bara ( or of some other sacrificial tree) which is as high as the sacrificer's mouth (or ohin), which he raises up and keeps on his right shoulder. While the adhvaryu is doing these things for the yajamāna, the pratiprasthātr does the same things for the wife (without mantras ) except that she has the yoktra girt round her upper garment, that her head is covered by a jala (& net or fillet) of wool and she has a piece of some sacri fioial tree one span long for scratching her body. The sacri ficer and adhvaryu repeat long passages wherein the word dikşā occurs frequently (Ap. X. 10, 6 and X. 11, 1), and the adhvaryu makos him repeat the sambhāra-yajus mantras (Tai. Ā, III.8). The sacrificer then contracts the fingers of both hands one after another with mantras (first the small fingers of both hands, then the ring-fingers of both hands and so on) and ultimately he olinches his fists. He observes silence. Some priest ( like the pratiprasthāts) other than the adhvaryu inaudi. bly declares ( to the gods ) thrice and loudly proolaims to the world thrice 'this brāhmaṇa has undergone the consecration, son of so and so, grandson of so and so, great-grandson of so and go, the son of such and such a woman, grandson of such and such a woman and great-grandson of such and such a woman'. Even when the sacrificer was a kşatriya or vaisya, the announcement was still to be 'this brābmaņa 3541 &c.,' since after dikşā & person was supposed to be reborn and to be a child of holy prayer and to have become pure enough for receiving spiritual influences. The Sat. Br. III. 3. 3. 12 states "he who is consecrated becomes an embryo'. Dikşā takes place in the afternoon (Ap. X. 12. 1) and the sacrificer observes silence till the appearance of stars in the evening. The adhvaryu directs the milking of two cows to supply milk for

the sacrificer and his wife who are to subsist on the milk of the two cows during the period of the sacrifice. This vrata (obser Vance) of subsisting on milk is deolared by Jai. ( IV. 3. 8-9) to be kratvartha (an obligatory rule) and not puruşārtha (recommendatory ). Vide also Jai. VI. 8. 28. Some allowed rice or barley to be cooked in that milk. The two cows were milked in two separate vessels, one of which (meant for the sacrificer) was heated on the gārhepatya and the other (for the wife ) was heated on the dakşiņa fire. A kşatriya or vaibya sacrificer could take gruel or amikşā respectively or all persons could subsist on milk or on rice cooked in milk or on fruits ( if enough milk was not available) or if he had a desire for ourds, he could use ourds or use fried barley grains or he could take ghee. He was to take his food at midday or midnight long after ordinary men have taken their meals and he took his food from a pot which was not earthenware and the wife from a copper pot. Persons who were not dikşitas were not to see him when taking his milk or other vrata diet. The wife was also to take her milk or other diet in her own place. Vide Ap. X. 16 and Kāt. VII. 4. 19-34 for details. The dikşita and his wife ( to some extent) have to observe certain rules ( till the final bath ) and people also had to observe some rules with reference to him. He has to keep awake on the night of the dikşā (Jai. XII. 1. 17), on the night when soma is purchased and on the night before the pressing day. He is not *543 to speak with women or sūdras nor should a gūdra follow him. If he is obliged to speak to a sūdra he should do so by employing a messenger belonging to the three higher varnas. He may speak to or bless another, but he was not to bow to another, even if the latter was his ācārya or father-in law or a king. No one was to touch him or to address the dikşita by his name ( but use only such terms of address as 'bhoh', dikşita' &c.). The sacrificer was not to keep aside the antelope horn till the fees were distributed. He could laugh covering his face with his hand and should not show his teeth. He was not ordinarily to answer calls of nature by day, but if he has to do so, he must do so in & shaded spot. He has to observe complete colibacy. While he is consecrated for the sacrifice, he does not go out by the

western door, nor does he perform the daily agnihotra, nor Vaišvadeva nor offering of bali nor perform the darśapūrpamāsa işti (Jai. XII. 1. 19-23 ), but he may employ another to do all these. He must speak the truth and address people in a pure and conciliatory style adding the word 'canasita' when address ing a brāhmaṇa and the word 'vicakşaņa 'wben addressing & ksatriya or vaisya (vide Ait. Br. I. 6). He must always be in the pavilion at sunrise and sunget; he sleeps on the ground to the south of the āhavaniya with his head to the east and sleeps on his right side and does not turn his back to the fire. He always sits on antelope hide and never leaves it and his staff (except when answering calls of nature). No one is to eat the food given by a dikşita till the agnişomlya victim or its omentum is offered. It is recommended by all the sūtras that dikşā (consecration) should not be finished in one day, but it should extend over 12 days or a month or a year or till from being fat he becomes lean ( vide Āp. X. 14. 8, X. 15. 4, Ašv, IV. 2. 13–15 ). Every day (while the diskā lasts ) the sacrificer observes silence from the afternoon till the appearance of stars and in the morning from before sunrise till the sun goes up. The dikşita is allowed to go himself or to send agents called ( sanihāra ) 2543 to colleat money and materials necessary for the sacrifice. He has to observe many rules on his journey ( vide Ap. X. 19, 6-16 ). 

After the day (or da ys of dikşa), the next day the first rite is the prāyapiyā 2544 (opening) isti. In this işti caru (rice ) cooked in milk is offered to Aditi (Jai. IX. 4. 32-40) and four offerings of ājya to four more deities viz. Pathyā Svasti, Agni, Soma and Savity in the four directions ( viz, east, south, west and north ) respectively. Caru is offered to Aditi in the centre. Agni Sviśtakst is the sixth deity. According to Asv. IV. 3.3 po ajyabhāgas are offered in this işti, but according to Kāt. VII. 5. 15 they are offered. The priests that officiate in this işti should as far as possible officiate in the Udayaniga (concluding ) işti. The rites of this işti end with the first Samyu, 6545 but there is no patni.samyāja and no gamiştayajus.

The puronuvākyā vorges in this işti become the yājyd verses in the udayaniya işti and vice versa ( vide Aśv. IV.3.2 for them). He keeps aside in a well-known place in the prāguarnsa the cooking pot (from which the leavings of rios sticking to the bottom are not removed according to some ), the mekşane and the barhis (except the prastara ) for use in the udayaniya. Jai. (XI. 2. 66-68 ) refers to this use of nişkisa in the udaya niya işti. 

Then comes the purchase of soma (referred to in the Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras as rājan '). Soma is purchased from a brāhmana of the Kutsa gotra or from a sūdra (Ap. X. 20. 12 allows it to be purchased from any brābmana ). 3546 Jai. III. 7. 31 states that the vendor of soma is someone other than the priests. The seller of soma is asked to free it from the weeds that may be mixed up with it; the adhvaryu turns his back towards soma when this ( weeding ) is being done and neither the adhvaryu nor his assistants nor the sacrificer nor the latter's sons should do the weeding out nor does anyone of these see it being done (Sat. VII. 1, p. 609). The some plant is placed on the southern part of the red hide of a bull by the pratiprasthātr spread on the place where uparavas (four sound ing holes) will be made later on and the seller of some sits on the northern part of the hide. A water jar is placed in front of soma. The doors of the sacrificial hall are shut, the adhvaryu pours into the jubū four times ājya from the dhruvā ladle used in the prayapiya (or five times for those who are pañca vattins), ties & piece of gold by a blade out of the darbhas spread on the altar, puts down into the juhū the blade with the gold and makes an offering into the alavaniya of that ajya ( this offering is called hiranyavati abuti ); he takes out the piece of gold, casts the blade ( with wbich it was tied) on the vedi and ties the gold piece with a thread. The doors of the hall are opened and the adhvaryu and yajamāna coine out. To the south of the eastern door of the sacrificial hall stands a heifer (called somakrayani), that is one, two or three

VII. 2, p. 623 for further details). The cow is not held by her ear or her foot is not tied by a rope ( she may be held by the neck, if necessary). She is invoked by the adhvaryu ( who is sitting ) with a mantra *oidasi'(Vaj. S. IV.19, Tai. 8. 1.2.4.1). The cow is led towards the north, the adhvaryu and yajamana follow her. After she goes six steps, at her 7th step, the brahma and yajamāna sit down to the cow's right, behind her sits the adhvaryu and the nest priest to her north. They keep the golden piece on the spot where the 7th step is put by her (which is first covered with his folded hands by the adhvaryu ) and make an offering of it to Aditi ( adityai idam na mama ). Taking the sphya the adhvaryu draws lines round the 7th foot-print (once with a mantra, twice silently ) from right to left (Ap. X. 23. 3 adds that lines are drawn also with the antelope horn of the sacri ficer); the dust on the lines is gathered with the hand and put into a pot ( sthall ) and handed over to the yajamāna who passes it on to his wife who invokes the cow with a mantra. He washes his hand ( that has the piece of gold in it) on the 7th foot-print ( of the cow ), pours some water on the dust colleoted in a pot, divides the dust into three parts, one of which is placed on the cold ashes of the gārbapatya, the 2nd on the cold ashes of the ahavaplya and the third is given to the wife who places it in the house. The adhvaryu ties the piece of gold to his small finger (on which it must be at the time of āpyāyana and pres sing of soma and at the time of taking the amsu and adabhya oups ). The adhvaryu directs the sacrificer's servant to bring & piece of cloth for tying soma, another for covering it all round and a turban; the first is carried by the adhvaryu or yajamāna and the rest by the pratiprasthāts. They go with their faces to the east towards the soma which is in a four-wheeled cart

covered all round and above with mats &c. Detailed rules follow how som& stalks ( amšu ) are selected and taken with the hand, tied in the cloth and covered with the turban ( Āp. X. 24. 7-14, Kāt. VII. 7. 12-21). The yajamāna pays homage to some and waits upon Aditi ( Āp. X. 25. 1). The adhvaryu hands over the soma (so tied and turbaned) to the vendor of goma 548 and there ensues a dialogue ( which is a mook drama ) between the vendor and the adhvaryu wherein they higgle for the price of the soma ( five times, beginning with a kalā or 'ath or the thigh of the cow and ending with the whole cow). Gold piece is also offered to the vendor of some, who says 'goma is sold to you but offer me some other animals' and the adhvaryu roplies * yours are the gold piece, clothes, goats, another cow, & cow and bull and three other cows.' Adhvaryu comes with the soma in his right hand and pushes aside the garment from the sacrificer's right thigh and places the soma tied in a piece of cloth on the thigh of the sacrificer, who mutters the text * svāna bhrājān. ghāra 854' &o.' (Vāj. VI. 27, Tai, 8. I. 2. 7.1). Ultimately the gold piece and somakrayaņi cow are brought back, another is offered in exchange and the former is sent to the cowpen belong ing to the sacrificer, Ap. ( X. 27. 8) and Sat. (VII, 2. p. 644) say that according to some the vendor is always struck with sticks and clods of earth (i. e. there is a show of seizing the soma from him and driving him away with sticks, vide Kāt. VII. 8. 27 also). The sacrificer's staff is handed over to the maitrā. varuņa priest ( vide Jai. IV. 2. 16-18) and the sacrificer holds in both his hands the bundle of soma placed on his thigh, gets up, places his hand on his head and thereon the bundle of soma, approaches & cart ( sakata ) kept to the south ( of the place

(VII. 2. pp. 636-643) sets out what things are offored in exchange of Soma and the dialogue between the adhvaryu and the vendor of soma. There were several options as to the things offered in exchange for soma, They were ten viz. seven cows, a gold piece, clothos, a sbo-goat; some said they wera 13 (ten cows plus the other three ) or only four (ono cow and the other threo). 

2549. Śtina, Bhraja and others are supposed to be Gandharvad, guardians of the cow and other things offered, as the price of soina. Vide Bat. Br. III. 3. 3. 11 (8. B. E. vol. 26 p. 72 ). Jaimini (XII. 4. 5-7) states that top things aro offered as the price of soma and that some is not purchased by offering these Boparately, but by offering thom in ono lot (samuccaya). Baud.

where soma was bought ) that is washed, is covered with a mat or the like and has all its parts complete. The adhvaryu spreads on the box of the cart a blaok antelope-skin with the neck portion to the east and hairy side upwards, places the soma thereon, covers it with another piece of cloth, ties a skin to & staff as a flag. Two oxen are yoked to the cart, the Subra bmanya priest (an assistant to the udgatr ) standing on the ground between the two shafts of the cart drives the oxen hold ing two palāsa branches in his hand ( as whips ). The adhvaryu touches the cart and directs the hotę to repeat a verse for soma that is bought (or being taken round) and directs the subra hmanya priest to pronounce the Subrahmanyā invocation. The hotr stands three steps behind the cart between the two wheel tracks, and while keeping his heels firm and unmoved throws up to the south with a verse ( tvam vipraḥ, Ašv. IV. 4. 2 ) clods (or dust ) thrice with the forepart of his foot, then utters standing 'him bbūrbhuvaḥ svarom 'and a verge 'bhadrād abhi śreyah prehi' (Asv. IV. 4. 2). While following the moving cart between wheel-tracks he recites Rg. I. 91. 9-11, X. 71. 10, IV. 53.7 (half) and stops. When the cart stops the bots approaches the soma from the south side of the cart, and stands facing it. He touches the soma or the cloth covering it with two verses (called paridhāniyā viz. Rg. I. 91. 19 and VIII. 42. 3). Then the sacrificer touches the soma and comes to the sacrificial hall (sala ) along with all the priests. The subrahmapya priest recites the famous subrahmanya litany 2550 (which is an

At the time of each upasad the subrahmanyā litany is recited (Sat. VII. 4. p. 676 ). According to Lāt, the subrahmanya stands inside the spot where the altar would be prepared and recites the litany and the yajamāng touches him and the wife touches the yajamāna. The formula is'O Subrahmanya (Indra who protects excellent prayers ), come, O Indra !

On the Agoypomiya day (day before pressing ) before the reference to sutyd, the words asau yajate' (this, so and so, offers saorifico ) ocour and the naines :( nākpatra, gotra and vyāvabarika namos ) of the sacrificer are mentioned with the names of his ances tors (son of bo and so, grandson of 80 and 80, great-grandson of so and 80 ) and then the names of bis living descendants according to seniority by birth, both males and females, in the words * fatber of such and such a son &.'Manu IX. 126 refers to this last. Ia Rg. I. 61. 1 and I. 52. 1 'Indra has the appellation mefa' and there is a legend that Iadra became a ram and drank tbe some of Medhatithi Kapva. In Rg. VIII. 2, 40 it is said that Indra in the form of a ram carried off Medbyatithi Kanva. In Rg. I. 51. 13 Indra is spoken of us born of the Ment of Vrpanasva (men&bhao vrgapasvasya ) and Sayana quotes the Tāndya that Mend was the daughter of Vīganasve. Indra is addressed as Kausika in Rg. I. 10. 11. The legend of Indra's love for A halya, the wifo of Gautama, is well-known. Vide Rāmāyana I. 48 and Vippupurdna 1. 9. 21. Jaimini (in IX. 1. 42-44 ) states that when the Subrahmany& litany is uttered in Agniętut and other rites and whon for Indra the word Agni is substituted, there is no substitution of othor adjootivos in place of Harivat and others. Sabara, bowever, notes that yajõika, do substituto othor words viz. they says '8 M T * - जामो धूमकेतो जातवेदो विचर्षण इति।'.

many days, to the soma feast.' Then he adds. Ye Gods and brābmaņas I come bither.' While the Subrahmanya is being recited the sacrificer mutters certain prayers (Ap. X. 28.5). Near the eastern door of the prāgvamsa the pratiprasthātr stands holding by the ear a goat ( as a present to king Soma ) that has white and dark spots of hair or red and dark ones, that is hornless, fat and bearded. The cart is stopped to the east of the prāgvarea with its shafts to the east or north, the yoke-pins are taken out, the oxen are released from the yoke (or only one ox, the northern one, is released). While this is being done prepa rations are made for atithyesti to receive hospitably as a guest king Soma. The adhvaryu and three other priests make ready a stool or couch (āgandi) of udumbara wood, having feet as high as the navel, with a board one aratni square plaited with cords of muñja grass, on which a black antelope skin is spread. On this the goma is placed after being taken out of the cart. Soma thus geated on the couch is brought inside the sala by the eastern door, is taken to the west of the ābavaniya and established to the south of the ahavaniya to the east of the seat of the brabmā priest. Then follows the work of atithyesti. The wife quickly takes out the materials for a cake on nine potsherds for Vişnu ( who is the principal deity in this işti). In all iştis (in Agnistoma ) after the dikşaplyā up to udayaniyā ( the concluding işti ) there is no agnyanyādbana, no taking up of vrata, no subsisting on fast food, no gifts and no choosing of brahma. There are only five praydja offerings and no anuyājas. 3851 Fire is produced by attrition, and the işti comes to an end after the first idā. For details see Ap. X. 30 and Kat. VIII. 1. After the ida is eaten there is tānūnaptra, a solemn convenant made by the sacrificer and the priests pledging themselves in the name of Tanûnapat (the mighty blowing wind, that is the witness of all living beings) not to injure each other. They make this*552 covenant by touching simultaneously clarified butter taken in & vessel of kamsya or in & camasa from the ajya in the dhruva ladle used in the atithy. and placed on the southern hip (south corner of west side ) of the altar. That clarified butter used for this covenant is shaken by the adhvaryu and is kept by him in a vessel (which is not earthen-ware) in a well-known spot

and is given mixed with the fast milk (vrate-dugdha ) to the saorificer in the afternoon (for eating ). Then follows the ayantara-dikşā (intermediate consecration) of the sacrificer, in which he offers a fuel-stick in the ahavaniya fire ( with 'agne vratapās. Vaj. 8. V. 6), the wife also silently offers a fuel-stick in gārhapatya; he touches water heated in a vegsel called madanti, clenches his fists more closely, tightens his girdle and drinks only hot milk. All priests also touch the madanti water and together with the sacrificer strengthen*552 the soma stalks with their hands holding golden pieces with the mantra 'amāur-amsu' ( Vāj. S.V.7, Tai. S. 1.2. 11. 1). Then they place their right hands one after another on the prestara which is on the southern end of the vedi with the palms turned upwards and cover the palms with their left palms turned downwards (this action being called nihnaya, aocording to Ap. XI. 1. 12 and Kāt. VIII, 2. 9). Nihnava 8554 is a kind of salutation to Heaven and Earth. 

Then follows Pravargya and after that Upasad or the Upasad may precede Pravargya (Ap. XI. 2. 5, Sat. VII, 4. p. 662). Both are done twice, in the morning and then in the afternoon, for at least three days ( 2nd, 3rd and 4th) if soma is to be pressed on the 5th, but if soma is to be pressed on the 7th or any later day (from the beginning ) then there will be more Pravargyas and Upuseds.2555 The same barhis, prastara and paridhis employed in the ātithyā are used in the upasads and in the rite of Agnişomlya pašu. 

Pravargya is separately dealt with in most sūtras, as in Ap. XV. 5-12, Kat. XXVI, Baud. IX. 6 ff. It was supposed to provide the sacrificer with a new celestial body 8588, It was an

Independent rite by itself (apūrva ) and was not the modi fication of any other rite ( vide com, on Kāt. XXVI. %.5). It appears from Ap. XIII, 4, 3-5 that the Pravargya rite was not necessarily performed in every Agnigtoma. The gbarma is styled Samrat in Vaj. S. 39.5, is identified with the sun, is said to be the head of Yajña and the hot milk was divine life and light. Vide Ait. Br. IV. 1, Sat. Br. XIV. 1-4, Tai. Ar. IV. 1-4%. V. 1-12; and Haug's translation of Ait. Br. pp. 41-43 ( note ), S. B. E vol. 44, Intro. XLVI-L. An earthernware veseel, one span in height, is made, the middle of which is contracted ( like a mortar ), whiob has a rim or belt (mekhala ) about three fingers lower down from the top which is & large and deep bowl and has at the end a hole or spout for pouring in liquid, This is called mabāvira and it resembles three pots placed on one another. There are two other earthenware vessels ( which are called mahavira). There are also two milking bowls ( pin vana ) and two round plates called raubiņa for baking two cakes. All the three are heated with the fire of horse dung kindled at the gārhapatya ( or dakşiņa according to some ) fire, baked in a square pit like ordinary, pans and tben taken out. The two purodāsas baked on the round rauhiņ88 are offered into fire in the morning and evening to Day and Night respectively. The vessel called mabāvira is placed on a raised clay platform and fire is kindled round it, and when it is hot ghee is poured into it. The principal mabāyira is the first vessel and the other two are not to have the different processes performed on them (they are apracaraniya, Ap. XV. 6. 11). These other two are kept covered with cloth on the big āgandi to the north of the stool on which soma is placed and to the south of the āhavaniya (Kat. XXVI. 2. 17). To the boiling ghee in the principal vessel are added the milk of a cow and of a she-goat having a male young one. The hot milk thus mixed and contained in the mahāvira is called 'gharma', of whioh offerings are made to Asvins, Vāyu, Indra (with Vasus and Rudras and Aditya. ), to Savits, Bțbaspati, Yama. The sacrificer drinks ( the priests only smell ) the remainder by the upayamapl. The hot; repeats Beveral mantras at various stages from the time the mahāyira is placed on the raised platform up to the time when the hot milk is offered and the priest called prastotę chants sāmans. The whole of this ceremony is called Pravargya. A few interesting matters out of the numerous details of this rite are indicated here. All the doors of the sacrificial hall are screened with cloth, the wife's shed also is so screened and she is to sit in her

shed (and not to see the mahavira,8887 but at a later stage sbe looks at it and repeats & mantra, Kat. XXVI. 4,13). Whatever wooden pātras are required in this rite they are 588 made of udumbara and the cords are made of muñja grass. The paridhis were thirteen and of vikankata and the fuel-sticks for boiling the gharma were to be of the same wood or of khadira, palāša, udumbara and a few other trees. There were three black antelope skins to be used as fans and two rukmas (plates or bars) of gold and silver, two vedas ( bunches of kuga), one of which has its ends cut off. Special rules are laid down about the clay out of which the mahavira vessel is to be made ( vide Ap. XV.1. 9 ff.) viz. 558 it was to be dug from a pit to the east of the ābavaniya fire; with that earth was to be mixed the dust dug by & wild boar and the clay from an ant-hill, pūtika ( a plant), the bair of a goat and of a black antelope skin; on it an aja ( she-goat) was to be milked. The clay so mixed is to be carried only by men of the higher castes and hot water is to be poured on the clay only from madanti vessels 8560 in order to mix the various ingredients. No sūdra nor woman is to look at all this. Two Vessels for milking the cow and the she-goat are made of this very clay. The Mahavira is to be lifted up only with two wooden pieces like tongs (called parisāsa or sapha ) and never otherwise. The asandi ( stool or chair ) on which the mahāvira is to be placed is bigger than the one for king Soma ( thereby bringing out its super-eminence as samrāt) and it is placed north of the seat for Soma.

A silver blade or plate of one hundred raktıkās (berries for weighing ) in weight is inserted in the loose sand of the western mound, sheaths of reed grase kindled at the garbapatya are thrown on the mound and the maha vira vessel is placed thereon. Then pieces of vikankata wood (paridhis) are laid round the Mahā vira by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthāte, in all 13, the last being placed by the adhvaryu. Then a gold bar or plate (representing the Sun) is placed on the Mahāvira pot. The adhvaryu fans the fire thrice by means of the three fans made of black antelope skin from right to left and then thrice from left to right. When a blaze is produced the gold plate is taken away. According to the Ait. Br. IV.2 and Asv. IV. 6. 3. the hotf recites several verges ( 21 in number ) when the empty Mabāvira is being hented (they constitute the pūrva patala) and several operations such as anointing it are being performed. The Ait, Br. IV. 5 further prescribes 21 verses for recitation by the hots when the cow is being milked (they are called uttara patala). Vide Asv. IV.7. 4 also. 

According to Sat. Br. XIV. 2. 2. 44-46 and Jai. III. 3. 32-33 the Pravargya was not to be performed at a sacrificer's first soma sacrifice and it was not to be performed for anyone and everyone, but only for him who was well-known or was & com plete master of the veda. On the day previous to the soma pressing day, the two performances of pravargya and upasad are combined and gone through in the morning and on that day takes place the ' udvāgana ' ( setting out or orderly discharge ) of the pravargys either by laying out the pravargya apparatus in the form of a human body or by throwing them in the midst of water or in a river island &o. They ( the priests and yaja māna ) set out as a general rule ( Ap. XV. 16. 6 ) all the imple ments on the uttaravedi, the prinoipal mahā vira vegbel as the head is placed close to the front side of the navel of the uttara. vedi, the two other mahāyiras are placed to its east, the bunch of kusa grass ( called veda ) is placed on top of the maha vira to represent sikhā (top-knot of hair), the two lifting stioks (saphas) are placed on two sides as arms and so on. Vide Sat. Br. XIV. 3. 1. 16, Ap. XV. 15, Kat. 26.7.14 ff. According to Ap. XV. 11. 10-13 the yajamāns and some of the priests viz. hotf, adbvaryu, brahmā, pratprastbātr and agnidbra drink the remainder of the milk (gharma) from the upayamani (a large wooden spoon).

When & person performs pravargys he should not for a year partake of meat, should not approach a šūdra woman for sexual intercourse, should not drink water from an earthen pot and should not allow a südra to eat the leavings of his food ( Āp. XV. 12. 13). According to Sat. Br. XIV, 3. 1. 32 ff the gold plate goes to the brahmā, the gharma to adbvaryu, while acoord. ing to Ap.

Offerings of clarified butter are made in this işti to Agni and Soma with the juhů ladle and to Vişnu with the juhů after pouring therein the ajya taken in the upabhrt ladle; that is, the principal deities are Agni, Soma and Vişnu and that besides the abutis of ājys to these there are the upasad ābutis with the mantra 'ya te' &o. Vide the com. on Kat. VIII. 2. 35 for all details. All actions done after the atithya işti such as the strengthening of some, the ninbava, the recital of the subrahmanya litany take place in each upasad (per formed in the morning and afternoon for three or more days). There are no ajyabhāgas, no prayājas nor anuyājas and no offering to Agni Sviştakst (Ašv. IV. 8. 8.). The three yerses, Rg. VIL.15.1-3, are repeated thrice each, 80 as to make nine kind. ling verses (s&midhenis) in the morning and Rg.

The upagad mantras show that they have reference to the sieges of iron, silver and gold castles. How these mantras came to be inserted here it is difficult to say. Vide Sat. Br. III. 4. 4. 3-4 (for the cities and their siege). Ap. XI. 4. 8 adds that if a hostile king gives battle or attacks the capital of & kşatriya performing a soma sacrifice, on the first upasad a piece of iron should be placed in the aruva ladle and offered along with the clarified butter, on the 2nd upasad a piece of silver and on the 3rd a piece of gold should be so placed. The yājyās of the morning upasad become the anuvākyās in the afternoon and vice versa. Jaimini (X. 17. 43-46) establishes that Upasads are special iştis (apūrva ) and only those parts that are expressly stated in the texts are to be performed in them and not others that occur in the model işti. The procedure of upasad is like upām uyāja (Sat. VII. 4. p. 666). 

On the 2nd day of the upagads after the morning pravargya and upasad rites are performed the great vedi for the soma sacrifice is measured and made (Kāt. VIII. 3. 6, Sat. VII. 4. pp. 679-685 and Āp. XI. 4. 11). In front of the āhavaniya to the east & peg (sanku) is driven in the ground at a distance of 6 prakramas (Baud. VI. 2%) or according to Kāt. VIII. 3.7 at the distance of 3 prakramas to the east from the eastern post ( i. e. the middle of the door) of the ordinary agni-sala a peg is driven which is called antaħpūtya (intermediate ) or talāmukhiya (according to Baud.); 36 prakramas to the east from this peg another peg is driven, which is called yupāvatiya (1. o. connected with the hole for yüpa). A cord is stretched between these two pegs and is called prsthya (spine). On both the south and north sides of the first peg (i. e. of antahpatya) pegs are driven at the distance of 15 prakramas and on the south and north sides of the 2nd peg two pegs are driven at & diatance of 12 prakramas each. In this way the west side called froņi ( hips ) of the mahāvedi is 30 prakramas 3563 and the

VIII. 8. 14 a pada is oqual to two prakremas. Kāt. VIII. 3. 10 optionally allows 161 prakramas on the north and south of tho first pog i. e. the froņi (west side of the mabavedi) will then be 33 prakramus (instead of 80 ).

east side called arsa ( shoulders ) is 24 prakramas and the length of the mabā vedi is 36 prakramas. A rope is passed all round the mabāvedi. Almost all the samskāras that are performed for the vedi in darśapūrņamāsa are performed for the great vedi in somayaga (Sat. VII. 4. p. 685 ). An uttaravedi (a quadrangular platform raised high ) is measured on the mahāvedi in its eastern part. This uttarayedi is on its west side ( śroņi) ten padas ( i. e. five on the south and five on the north of the prsthyā) and on its east side (ansa) eight padas ( some hold that the uttaravedi is 10 padas on all sides i. e. a perfect square ). The cātvāla pit ( i. e. its southern shoulder or the middle point of the southern side ) is 15 padas ( or one prakrama, according to Sat. P. 687) to the north from the northern shoulder of the mahāvedi towards the west, while the utkara near which the āgnidhra sits is 12 prakramas to the west of the cātvāla *584 ( i. e. its western side or its middle ) and one prakrama to the north of the line of the vedi. The utkara is about two padas in extent (com. on Sat. VII. 4. p. 687). The way to and from the vedi la between the utkara and the cātvāla pit. The vedi is prepared ( i. e. its earth is loosened, clods are broken, roots taken out) with the sphya, a rib (of some holy animal) or an axe. For the nābbi vide at p. 1113 above. That day the vedi remains covered with the branches of uduinbara or plaksa tree. 

On the next day both the pravargyas and upasads of the morning and afternoon are gone through in the morning. After the udvāsana of the pravargya, the bringing forward of the fire ( agnipranayana ) from the āhavaniya to the uttaravedi takes place. The fire placed on the nābhi becomes the āhavaniya for all actions in the soma sacrifice and the original dhavaniya becomes the gārbapatya (Ap. XI. 5. 9-10). Kusa grass, the fuel and vedi are thrice sprinkled with water and the vedi is covered with that grass with the points of the blades to the east. Two carts, washed with water, with their yokes tightly bound but with no yoke-pins, are brought round from the agnisala and placed in the mahāvodi, one about one cubit (aratni ) to the south of the prsthya line and the other to the north about one cubit. The cart to the south ( called dakšiņa-havirdhāna ) is larger than the one to the north and the shafts of both are towards the east. These carta are called havirdhana because

the some plant (which is the havis in somayāga) is to be placed thereon. 2565 The south and north carts are respectively in charge of the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr. They are then covered with grass mats or thatch made of split bamboos. A mandapa (called bavirdbāna-mapdapa ) is erected by having six posts in front of the two carts and six behind them and having two bamboos on the posts from south to north. He suspends from the front part of the mandape & garland-like sheaf of twisted grass (rarāti). Various samskāras are performed on the axles of the carts by the wife and pratiprasthātr respec tively. Detailed rules about covering the carts and similar matters are passed over (Ap. XI. 7-8, Kāt. VIII. 4). The havirdhana maņdapa is higher in the east than in the west and has two doors one to the east and the other to the west (Sat. VII. 4. p. 701 ). No one is to take his meals or even to eat idā inside the havirdhāna mapdapa. The adhvaryu digs four round holes ( in two rows, two in each row ) below the fore part of the shafts of the southern cart (but not far from the axlo), each hole being about one span in diameter, being at a distance of one span from each and all being connected by cross-way subterranean pagsages. They are one arm deep. They are dug in such an order that the hole to the north-east is the last (i. e. first south-east one is dug, then north-west one is dug, then south-west and then north-east or first north-west orie, then south-east, then south-west and lastly north east). On these holes are spread kuģa blades over which two wooden boards ( adhişa vana-phalaka) are placed over which is spread the red skin of a bull (adhişavana carma), on which soma juice is extracted by means of four stones. These holes add to the noise of the stones by the sound reverberating through them and they are therefore called uparava.45*Jai. (XI. 4.52-53 ) states that the mantra 'rakso haņo' is to be repeated at each time when & hole is dug and not only once for all holes. The adhvaryu and the sacrificer

insert their right hands in the holes (the adhvaryu inserting his hand in the south-east hole and the sacrificer in the north west and then a second time the adhvaryu inserts bis hand in the south-west hole and the sacrificer in the north-east) and touch each other's hands and adhvaryu asks sacrificer, what is there?;' the sacrificer replies welfare (or happiness )' and the adhvaryu in a low voice says 'may that belong to us both.' This is done twice ( Kāt. VIII. 5. 14-21). At the second time the yajamāna asks 'adhvaryu! what is there ?', the adhvaryu replies' welfare' and the yajamāna gays 'let it be mine.' The uparavas are sprinkled with water beginning from the south east one and ending with the north-east one with a mantra (*raksohano &o.' Vāj. S. V. 25, Tai. S. I. 3,2). Then the rest of the prokşani water is poured into them, kušas are spread over their bottoms as in the hole of the yüpa ( described above ), a golden piece is placed thereon and offering of ajya is made. To the east of the uparavas or of the adbişavana-carma or of the upastambhango567 a four-cornered mound (khara) is made for keeping the soma vessels on with the earth ( dug up from the uparavas) that is sprinkled with water and mixed with sand. In front of this mound sufficient space is left to move about in the havirdhāna maņdapa. To the west of the utkara at a distance of six prakramas ( which comes to about the middle of the north side of the great altar ) is prepared the shed for āgnidhra, which is half inside and half outside the great vedi, which has four posts and the beams of which run from west to east, which has & door to the south and is covered on all sides with mats. This shed is so made that its west side would be a continuation of the end of the western side of the havirdhāna mapdapa and this shed is a square having sides of five aratnis each (com, on Kāt. VIII. 6. 13). The sadas is measured at a distance of three prakramas from the western side of the great vedi to its east and bas its length from south to north. The width of the sadas is nine aratnis (or half of its length) and its length (from south to north ) 27 aratnis or as much as would be necessary for allowing room to all the priests, their dhişnyas ( seats) and the pragarpakas ( assistants and spectators). In the midst of the sadas & post of udum bara is fixed which is of the height of the sacrificer above its pit and which is placed at a distance of one prakrama to the south of the prsthy., All samskāras that

are made on the yüpa and its pit are made in the case of this post except those referring to takala ( vide p. 1115 above ). The udumbara post has an ear-like protuberance towards the east when it is fixed in the pit. On that protuberance a gold piece is offered with the juhů and ajya is poured on in such & way that some of it will triokle to the ground. This audumbarl is thioker than any post of the sadas. The posts on the borders of the gadas are as high as the navel of the yajamāna towards its sides, but in the middle they are as high as the audumbari post. On the posts of the sadas beams are placed running from south to north and west to east. The middle of one third of this is covered with three mats that have their ends to the north, and then to the south and north of the middle portion three mats (on each side) are placed in such a way that their ends are turned towards the audumbari post. The sadas is covered with nine mats in all that are well sewn together. The sadas is surrounded by screens and it has two doors to the east and west (just as the havirdbāns pavilion has). Some prepare the sadas first and then the uparavas or vice versa (Ap. XI. 10. 19). The doors of the prāgvamga, the sadas and havirdhāna are so arranged ( opposite each other) that a person sitting in one of these can see into all. Then eight dhirnyas (seata ) are to be prepared. The first is made in the āgnidbra shed in its middle in such a manner that between it and the north side of the great vedi some space will be left for moving about. Six more dhirnyas are to be made in the sadas. The earth for all these dhispyas is taken from the cātvala pit. The six seats are made in the eastern portion of the sadas leaving between them and the eastern side of the sadas suffi cient space to move about. The earth is spread on the seats by the adbvaryu who faces the north when preparing all the seats (except two) and who is touched by the sacrificer with the sphy&. Over the earth sand or gravel is spread on all the seats. Out of the six seats the adhvaryu facing the west makes the seat for the hotę to the north of the prothy, line but touching it about one prakrama from the eastern door of the Badas (or on the prothyā line itself, according to Ap. XI. 14. 4). Then four more seats are made to the north of the seat of the hots in order for brāhmaṇdocharnsin, potr, nestr and acobāyaka respectively, each of which is at the same distance from the next and the seat of the acchāvaka is (four angulas ) larger than those of the rest. The seats are either square or round ( according to Sat VIL 7. p. 723) and of 18 angulas in diameter 

Oh. XXXIII ) 

Agniętoma-dhiệnyas

or on each side, and at the distance of one cubit or 18 angulas from each other (oom. on Kāt. VIII. 6. 22). To the south of the hott's dhişnya, the adhvaryu with his face to the north prepares at a distance of 4 aratnis from the hotę seat the seat for maitrāvaruña (or praśāstr), which seat is also to the south east of the audumbari post. The seat of maitrāvaruņa is pre pared immediately after hott's seat. These seven priests viz. āgnidhra to maitrāvaruņa are called the 'seven hot;s' in soms yāga according to Tai. Br. II. 3. 6 and Sāyaṇa thereon, but Ašv. I. 2. 26 seems to be opposed to this. Outside the sadas just opposite the āgnidhra shed to the south is prepared the mārjāJiya 2368 shed which is half inside the great vedi and half outside to the south and in the midst there is the mārjāllys Beat made by the adhvaryu facing the south. The mārjaliya shed has a door facing the north. When all these several sheds and seats are got ready the adhvaryu and spectators have to enter and leave the great vedi by & route between the cat vāla pit and the utkara or between the oātvāla and the agni. dhra shed and according to some on the day on whioh soma is pressed spectators may move about anywhere (Ap. XI. 13. 10-11). 

On the uparavas slender kušas with tips to the east or north are spread and over them are kept two boards (of udumbara or palāśa or kārsmarya wood) called adhişevaņa-phalaka 35082 between which there is a space of two angulas ( towards the west) which are one aratni long, are washed with water, their

eastern face being curved like the board of a wheel and the western face being straight. In modern practice the boards are not curved on the east, but are straight. The wood is dry and well planed. In sacrifices in which soma is pressed on more days than one the boards are grooved and made to fit in each other and pierced with a nail. The boards are made firm by driving two pegs through them in front, two behind and one each to the north and south ( 80 that they will not recede ). Vide Baud. VI. 28. The space of two fingers between the two is filled with the dust dug out from the uparavas. One board is placed on the two southern uparavas and the other on the two northern ones. On the two boards is placed a hide ( called adhişavana-carma), wbich is red and cut up all round to fit in with the boards, with the neck portion to the east and the hairy portion up. On the bide are placed four stones ( grāvan) for pressiog soma juice. The adhvaryu then issues directions to spread barhis over the great vodi (except the uttaravedi, the khara, uparavas and dhişpyas, Sat. VII.7. p.727) and for making the sacrificer take only one-fourth of the fast milk on which he is to subsist (according to Kāt. VIII. 6. 30, half of the milk ). Then begins the procedure of the sacrifice of an animal to Agni and Soma ( jointly). This is on the same lines as the nirūdba. pasubandha which has already been described. The various actions such as paristarana, placing the sacrificial pātras, pro kşapa are gone through, One more ladle called pracarant made of vikantaka wood and resembling a juhű is used in addition (Ap. XI. 16.6). The protiprasthātr (or noştr according to Sat. VII.8, p.736) brings the wife from her ubual place (the patniśālā). The sacri. ficer's near relatives who always share the same roof are called. The yajamāna touches the adhvaryu, the wife touches the sacri ficer, the song and brothers of the sacrificer touch the wife. They are all covered with a fresh piece of cloth and the adhvaryu offers with the pracarani offerings of ajya called Vaisarjina 1589 to Soma ( Kāt. VIII. 7. 1, Ap. XI. 16, 15). Then comes the carry. ing forward (pranayana ) of Agni and Some Fire is kindled on the dhavaniya and is carried to the uttaravedi. Numerous utensils and vessels are taken to the great vedi beyond the sadas for use in the animal sacrifice and in the pressing of soma next

day and kept in proper places.2570 Fire is established in the āgnidbra dhişnya. The soma stalks are taken to the bavirdhana mandapa and placed in the southern cart (hayirdhāna ) on & black antelope skin. The sacrificer consigns the soma to the care of gods with a mantra 'God Savitri here is thy soma' (Vāj. S. V, 39, Tai, S. I. 3. 4. 2). Then the yajamāna gives up the intermediate diksa, after offering into the āhavaniya & samidh with the mantra 'Agne vratapate' (Tai. S. I. 2. 11. 1, Vāj. S. V, 40) i. e, he loosens his girdle and his fists that so far had been clenched), gives up the vow of silence ( to be observed at both sandhyās) and his fast food and he hands over his staff to maitrāvaruņa ( Ap. XI. 18. 6). He may on the next day (soma pressing day ) partake of soma and the leavings of sacrificial food. Hereafter he may be addressed by name and food prepared in his house may be taken by others (Kāt. VIII.7. 22). Then the sacrifice of the animal to Agni and Soma takes place (of the omentum, the pasupurodāsa and havis ). Jai. after a lengthy discussion (VI. 8.30-43) holds that this pašu must be a chāga (a goat). Jai. (VIII. 1.12 ) states that the procedure of dars&-pürnamāsa is followed in this animal saorifice and not of soma sacrifice. Vide also Jai. VIII. 2.10-14, Animal sacrifice has already been described above ( pp. 1109-1131 ); but there are a few points of difference between the nirudha-paśubandha and the agnişomiya pašu offered the day previous to the soma pressing day ; viz. the svaru is not offered into fire in the latter nor is the heart-apit discharged. According to Jai. III. 7. 43-45 the maitrāvaruņa is the priest where praisa and anuvākyā are to be uttered ( ordinarily the praişa is given by adhvaryu and the anuvākyā is uttered by hotr.). When the omentum is offered & direction is issued to the subrahmanya priest to chant the subrahmanyasi litany for inviting Indra in which the sacrificer is described as the son, grandson and great-grandson of so and so and as the father and grandfather of so and so

When the subrahmanya call has been made, standing with his face to the west he brings in & jar the water from a flowing river that starts from a mountain,say but he should not pass over & river that is near his place, even if it does not start from a mountain. He takes this water before the sun sets and from & spot in the river where the shadow of a cloud and sunshine meet or ( if that is not possible ) in the shadow of one's own body or of & tree or of the river bank. He should fill the jar with water against the stream with 'havişmatir' (Vaj. S. VI. 23. Tai, 8. I. 3. 1%. 1). Sat. Br. III. 9.%. 8-9, Kat. VIII. 9. 8-10 and Āp. XI. 20. 10-12 suggest other alternative sources for the water. He enters with the jar of Vasativari waterSs78 by the path between the utkara and cātvala, takes it by the north of the āgnidhra shed, enters the sala by the eastern door and places the jar to the west of the salāmukhiya**** fire. In the second watch of the night the adhvaryu carries the jar of vabativarl waters on his shoulder and takes it round the altar and fires in several ways (minutely described in Ap. XI. 21. 3-5, Sat. VII. 8. p. 759 and Kāt. VIIL 9. 18-23). At that time only the saorificer and his wife are allowed to stay inside and all others have to go out. Ultimately the yasativari jar is placed in the dgnidhra shed (Ap. XI. 21. 5, Kat. VIII. 9. 23) and the soma plant also is placed in the same hut but on the dgandi (a large stool or couch).

That night the pratiprasthātr draws milk in the evening for the payasy: ( amikşa ) to be offered to Mitra and Varuņa the next day and the adhvaryu issues orders to milk the cows that yielded the fast milk for the sacrificer and his wife for making respectively from their milk āšir (1. e. soma mixed with milk) and for the graha (cup) of ourds ( dadhi) and to milk the cow that yielded the milk in the pravargya rite for dadhigharma ** (a warm beverage made with inspissated milk ) and for the milk that will be heated but not mixed with butter milk ( to be offered) to Mitra and Varuņa and boiled milk mixed with butter milk and brought to the state of ourds for the Aditya graha (cup).

Ap. (XII. 1. 6-XIL. 2. 13), Sat. (VIIL 1, pp. 770-777 ), and Kat. IX. % describe at great length how and where the numerous pātras required on this day are placed. According to Kat. IX. 2. 1 the unnetę priest arranges the patrag. Then pre parations are made for the savaniya pasu (the animal to be killed and offered on the day of the pressing of soma) on the lines of the agnişomlya pašu offered the previous day.

In each part he has to repeat at least one hymn in each of the seven metres viz. Gayatri, Anuştubh, Triştubh, Bphati, Uşpih, Jagati and Pankti. Ašv. ( IV. 13. 6-IV. 15, 3) states the hymns to be recited, the minimum being at least one hundred šks. If all the hymng and verses specified by Ašv. are recited the total of the Āgneya seotion will be over 1324 (out of which verses in Gayatri are 320, in Triştubh 591 and only one hymn, Rg. V. 6 of 10 verses, is in Pankti metre).

Agniştoma-Prātaranuvāka

About 250 verses 2578 are set out by Asv, for being recited ' in the Uşas kratu and about 407 in the Asvina kratu of the prātaranuvāka (in all about 2000 verses i. e. nearly one-fifth of the whole of the Rgveda ). The prātaranuvaka is to be recited in the low or base (mandra ) scale (Aøv. IV. 13.6). Asy, further directs that even when the minimum of 100 verses or any number short of the one prescribed by him are recited, the order of the hymns set out by him is to be followed and that the three hymns Rg. VII. 12 (to Agni in Triştubh ). VII. 73 (to Asvins in Triştubh ) and I. 112 (to Asvins in Jagati) are called mangala (auspicious) and that if the darkness of night is still there when he is about to finish the prataranuvāka he should go on repeating Rg. I, 112 till gun. light appears ( Asv. IV. 15. 7 and 9 ). 

While the Prātaranuvāka is being recited by the hots, the āgnidhra ( according to Kāt. IX. 1.15, the pratiprasthāts accorda ing to Ap. XII. 4. 4 ) priest takes out materials ( nirvāpa ) for five offerings which are & cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, dhānā (fried barley ) for two Haris ( bay horses of Indra ), Karambha (barley flour with ourds ) for Pūşan, curds for Sarasvati, payasya for Mitra and Varuņa. There is an option that all five are meant for Indra, but the last four are in that case to Indra associated with the other deities in order as shown below.999 The adhvaryu asks the hotr to think of water and is gues directions to the attendant of maitrāvarupa holding & mai. trāvarupa camasa (a flat wooden dish or cup with a handle) that he should come with the adhvaryu, to the nestr to fetch the wife or wives of the sacrificer, asks the other ftviks to hold the ekadhana pitchers and the āgnidhre to wait near the cātvāla pit with vasativarl waters.

While the ekadbana pitohers are being filled the hotr recites Rg, X. 30. 1-9 and 11 which are called 'aponaptriyā verses 'as the deity of those verses isapāmnapāt'( vide Ait. Br. VIII. %, AŠv. V, 1. 8 and 8. B. E. vol. 26. p. 23% n. 2).*581 Then the water in the maitrāvaruna camasa and the Vasativarl waters are mixed up together. And placing the vadativarl water in the hotộcamasa the adhvaryu hands the camasa to the sacrificer, which water is thence-forward called nigrabhya (Ap. XII. 9. 1). Then the adhyaryu makes an offering of ourds from a cup (called dadhi graha, Ap. XII. 7. 5-7). He also takes a few soma stalks from the heap of soma, places them on the upara (vide note 2582 ) and pours some vasativarl water over them, beats the stalks with the stone, extraots soma juice, fills a oup with it and offers it (this is called somagraha, Ap. XII. 7, 10-12). Ap. XII. 9 and Kat. IX. 4 describe how soma is extracted to fill the Upāṁsugraha by using the Nigrabhya water, a portion of it is offered in the southern part of fire (the tyāga is 'idam kūryāya') and a portion is kept in the Agrayanasthall and a large coil of soma stalks is placed in the Upamaūgraha for use in the evening pressing. Vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 489 and S.B. E. vol. 26 pp. 244-245 n. 2 for the method of the pressing of soma for upāṁsu-graba ( they slightly differ). Then comes the mahābhişava ( the great or prinoipal pressing of soma). The adhvaryu goes near the adhavaniya trough and pours into it all the water that is in the maitrāvaruna camasa and a third part of the vasativarl water also is poured in that trough and also of the ekadhand water. The rest of both kinds of waters is kept in the place of the ekadband water ( viz. to the west of the axle of the northern havirdhana and below it). The adhvaryu sits to the north of the adbişavana-carma towards the east and behind him sits the sacrifioer, to the south of the adhişavaņa-oarma sits the pratiprasthat, to the west nestr and to the north the unneti (Ap. XII. 12. 2

and Sat. VIII. 3. p. 825 ). A very large portion of the soma stalks is to be taken for the morning pressing and a small one for the midday one (Ap. XII. 9.7). The adhvaryu takes hold of the stone called upara, "588 places it on the adhişavana hide, brings soma stalks thereon, nigrabhya water is poured on them, the stalks are beaten by the priests with the other stones held in their right hands, which have a golden ring or the like. This is called the first turn or round ( paryāga). Then there is a second turn, when the stalks of some scattered about in the first beating are oollected and are again pounded. Then there is a third turn. The texts even prescribe how many times the stalks are to be beaten in each turn ( vide Ap. XII. 10. 4-8, 9 and XII. 12. 8-9). The wet and pounded stalks are collected by the adhvaryu into & vessel called sarnbharani, "588 are put in the adhavaniya trough which already contains water, the adhavaniya contents are thoroughly stirred, the stalks are washed, pressed, then taken out and placed on the adhişavana. carma.

As the cups are filled from the stream ( dhāra ) they are called dhāragrahas (com. on Kāt. IX, 6.26). The cups are wiped with the hems of the strainer or another strainer is employed for the purpose (Ap. XII. 14. 10–11). In the case of the maitrāvaruņa cup the contents are mixed with boiled but cooled milk, those of the manthin with barley flour. The three grahas viz. Agrayapa, Ukthya and Dhruva are filled to the brim. He then fills three oups called atigrāhyas for Agbi, Indra and Surya (Ap. XII. 15. 9, only in Agniętoma and not in other soma sacrifices ). After the cups are filled, the dropakalasa trough is half filled with soma juice, then the stream of soma stops ( Ap. XII. 16. 9, Kāt. IX. 6.26 ), all fluid from the woollen strainer is wrung out into the dronakalasa and the strainer is kept aside. Then he pours from the maitrāvaruņa camasa which is filled with ekadhana waters into the adhavaniya trough as much as would be necessary (for filling all soma vessels in the morning pressing); he spreads the strainer with its hem to the north on the mouth of the pūtabbrt trough, pours thereon & portion of the soma juice that is in the adhavaniya trough and then touches all the three troughs with distinct mantras ( Āp. XII. 16. 11). Then the adhvaryu, prastotr, pratihartf, udgāts, the brahmā (being the last) come out of the havirdhāna shed touching each other with the right hand in the order stated (Tandya Br. VI. 7. 12, Ap. XII. 17.1), adhvaryu being the first (some give a slightly different order ). They perform (or according to Kat, the adhvaryu alone performs) what are called 'viprud-dhomas 2885 When the soma is being pressed drops of it are scattered about. In order to make these drops go to the gods and also as a sort of expiation this offering of djya is made to Soma ( in all the three savanas).

All pavamāna chants are introduced in this manner (i, e. by giving a handful of kušas to the prastotr &o.). In the case of stotras other than pavamana, the adhvaryu makes the chanters start after giving them two kusa blades with 'asarji ...... upā vartadhvam'. At the time of chanting the bahiệpa vamāna 2589 stotra, the priests and sacri ficer sit inside the vedi not far from the oātvala pit in a certain order and look at the cātvāla or they sit round the northern shoulder of the vedi.

This is the position of the chanters in all stotras (Lat. I. 11. 18-23). Then the prastots, udgāts and pratiharts chant the bahişpavamana chant.

The Bahispavamana of sacrifices lasting for more than one day is chanted in the sadas except on the first day (vide Drāhyāyane Sr. IV. 1. 13). The sacrifiber and at least four of the other priests (but not adhvaryu ) aot as choristers (upagāts, Ap. XII. 17. 11-12). According to Lat. I. 11. 26 and Drabyāyana III. 4. 6 the priests sing the chorus 'bo' and the sacrificer says'om' continuously in the mandra ( low ) tone in the intervals between the prestāva and the other elements of the chant and also during the chanting of these elements except the nidhana, according to com. on Drāhyāyana III. 4. 6 and stop from doing so at the finale ( nidhana) which is to be sung by the three sāma priests together. Jai. (III. 7.30) states that the choristers are some of the priests (ftviks) themselves (except adhvaryu) and not others. At the time of the first prastāva of the bahispavamāng chant, the $588 sacrificer mutters the famous prayer (set out on p. 5 above) 'asato inā sad gamaya ...... māmptam gamaya' (Br. Up. I. 3. 28 and com. on Kat. IX. 7.4), while according to Āp. XII. 17. 14 the sacrificer mutters the dagahotr texts (vide p. 993 above for them). The first stotra at each pressing is called Pavamāna (Ap. XII. 17. 8-9), that at the morning savana being called Bahispavamāna, those at the 2nd and 3rd pressings being respectively called Mādhyandina pavamana and Arbhava or Tștiya Pavamāna. The other stotras are called Dhurya (com. on Kāt. IX. 14. 5). 

According to Lat. I. 12. 1 and Drābyāyaṇa Śr. III. 4. 16-17 the prastoty takes the prastara bunch from the adhvaryu, asks the permission of the brahmi and the praśāstr and then hands over the prastara to the udgātr who touches his thigh with it, and keeps it down with a yajus mantra.

The note below will, it is hoped, convey some idea (however vague) of the manner in which the saman verses are manipulated for the purpoge of chanting. It is very difficult (nay, almost impossible) to convey in print how the sāmans are sung. The dificulty is aggravated by the fact that the notations adopted in the mss. and the editions are different and hardly any two Mss. agree in all respects. . Besides the present writer does not profess to have studied the intricacies of ancient Indian or modern European musio and is not in a position to write a dissertation on this topic.

It may, however, be stated here that even on reading these books no thorough knowledge of sāmagānas can be acquired.

A generation or two hence, it is feared, hardly any learned sāma singers will be left. 

Most of the saman ohants are taken from the Rgveda. In reciting & verse from the Rgveda attention has to be paid to the accents called udātta, anudātta and svarita. When the same Verge is chanted as a saman, one has to attend besides to the notes of the melody to which the verse is being sung. The way of marking the accents of the Rgveda verse is not followed when it is taken in the Samaveda. The svarita of the Rgveda is represented in the Samaveda M88. in several ways, but generally by the figure % written above the letter and anudatta preceding an udatta is represented in the Samaveda sarbita by the figure 3 and udatta following an anudatta has the figure one placed on the letter. There are further detailed rules about these accents and also other marks which are not set out here. Only one further remark is made. The letter "ra"

preceded by 2 is placed over a gvarita coming after the udatta whicb follows another udatta. Modern sama singers have generally no knowledge of these ancient rules and signs but only chant as they learned from their teachers, nor do their obants always agree with the notations in the several M8s. Further there is a certain monotony and sameness in their melodies. If one hears a modern singer sing songs in several rāgas like the Jogi or Jhinjoți or Khamūch a person totally ignorant of the rāgas can feel, however vaguely, the difference between the two. But this is not so when a Rathantara melody or a Bșhat melody is sung. According to the Sāmavidhāpa-brāhmaṇa ( I. 1. 8 and 14 ) these notes (also called staras) are seven, viz. krusta, prathama (1st), dvitiya (2nd), třtiya, caturtha, pañcama (or mandra) and antya (last) or atisvārya, 2591 Sayana explains that the seven svaras named above are arranged in a descending scale, though from the words first, second and so on one is apt to suppose that they are in an ascending scale. Sāyaṇa further states that these seven svaras are also called yamas. 2583 In the Nāradiya-sikşā ( Benares Sanskrit series) the seven svaras are stated to be prathama, dvitiya, třtiya, caturtha, mandra, kruşta and atisvāra ( 1. 12). The kruşta is the highest note and comes before prathama in many texts. The same work (III. 5) mentions the seven classical notes, şadja, psabha, gāndhāra, madhyama, pañcama, dhaivata and nişāda ( which are indi cated in modern India as sa ri or re ga ma pa dha ni). The Nāradiya-sikşā then (V. 1-2) tries to establish a correspondence between the seven ancient names of the notes of sāma chanters and the seven notes of olaseioal times by stating that the seven sāman notes mentioned ( from prathama onwards ) are respec tively the same as the notes produced on the Indian viņā (lute) called madhyama, gāndhāra, fşabha, şadje, dhaivata, nişada and pañcama. Pandit Sātavalekar (Introduction to the edition of the Sāmaveda p. 2) holds that the printed Nāradiya-śikṣā bas

wrongly transposed the places of nişāda and dhaivata. *** 

The notations employed in the North Indian and South Indian M88. of the Sāmaveda vary considerably and the confusion is made worse by the fact that the several sakhās (such as the Kauthumas, the Rāņāyanlyas and Jaiminlyas ) have various readings and varying notations of their own. The Nāradiya-sikşā further points out (VI. 2-6) that the sāınans can be sung to the notes of the ordinary viņa and also to the accompaniment of the movements of the thumb and fingers of the hand (and so it calls the latter gātrayiņā, 'body-lute '). The reciter sitting cross-legged is to place his hands on the two knees, to touch by the tip of the thumb the iniddle parva (joint) of the fingers for indicating the several notes of the song (and not the root of the fingers ) and to hold the band in front of his nose like & cow's ear. The seven svaras are indicated as follows : 2594 the krusta is on the head ( top ) of the thumb, the prathama (i. e. madhyama of classical notes ) is on the central part of the thumb; gāndhāra, şşabba, sadja and dhaivata (i. e. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and mandra ) are respectively indicated by (touching with the tip of the thumb the oentral joints of ) the fore-finger, the middle finger, the ring finger and the small finger; and nişāda is indicated at that part of the palm below the small finger which resembles a channel when the fingers are closed in a fist. 

While the Bahişpavamana is being chanted the innets priest pours the soma juice contained in the adhavaniya vessel on to the pūtabhịt trough over which tbe woollen strainer is stretched with its bem to the north. When the chant is finished the adhvaryu issues directions (praisa ) to tbe āgnidhra priest to kindle fires (on the dhişpyas), to strew kusa grass (on the vedi) and to deck the purodābas and to the pratiprasthātr to come with the savaniya (to be sacrificed on the pressing day) pašu (animal). The agnidhra brings burning coals from the āgnidbriga fire and kindles fires on the dust (or sand) of the several dhişnyas beginning with that of the hotf(in the order in which the seats were arranged and with the same mantras ).

Agnidhra spreads kusas beginning from the gārhapatya up to the abavaniya, along the prsthy: line and decks the purodagas. He offers Boma into the ahavaniya, agnidhriya and mārjāllya fires and djya in others. The adhvargu, whom the sacrificer touobes, fills the Asvina cup (graha) from the dropakalada with the pariplavā (& small spoon resembling a sruo without its rod, Ap. XII. 2.7 ) and the other oups that are not dhārāgrahas are also filled in the same way. 

Then begin the rites for the offering of the savaniya pasu, commencing from the tying of a triple girdle round the post ( yüpa ). According to Kāt. IX, 8.1 the girdle (rabang ) that was used the previous day at the time of sacrificing the Agni. somlya animal is again used for the savaniya pasu, while according to Āp. XII. 18. 1% a new girdle is used. In the Agnistoma the animal sacrificed on soma-pressing day is a goat for Agni. In the Ukthya sacrifice another goat (in addition) is sacrificed for Indra and Agni, in the şodasin sacrifice a third pašu (a ram according to Kat. IX. 8. 4, a goat according to Ap. XII. 18. 13 ) is offered in addition and in the Atirātra a fourth one (a goat) to Sarasvati in addition. Kāt. (IX. 8. 5-6) allows optionally a ewe. These four animals that are offered are called stomāyana (Kat. IX. 8.7 ) and kratupasus (Ašv. V. 3. 4). Then the procedure of Nirūdhapasubandha described above is followed up to the offering of the vapa (omentum) and sub sequent mārjana (purification with water). Then all the priests and the sacrificer enter the sadas and oocupy places to the east of the audumbari post and to the west of their several Beats ( dhişpyās ) *S98 and other places after looking (with man tras for each) at the several cups, the three troughs (adhava niya, pūtabbft and droņa-kalasa), the clarified butter and vessels and the sacrifioer pays homage to all these (with mantras set out in Ap. XII. 19.5 ff). 

At this stage the pratiprasthair brings the five gavaniya offerings (vide p. 1163 above). The adbvaryu places them on the vedi, cuts off portions of the offerings, arranges them in one large vessel (or the juhü) in such a way that the cake for Indra is placed in the middle, the dbānd is to the east of it, karambha to the south, parivāpa to the west and amiksā to the

north. The portions meant for sviştakst are placed in the Upabbrt. The adhvaryu issues his direction to the maitrāvaruņa to recite the anuvākyā for the purodaśa and other offerings to Indra in the morning pressing and to ask the hots to repeat the yajya for the same. The anuvākyas for the purodaśa and other offerings in the three savanas are respectively Rg. III. 52. 1,5 and 6 and the apuvākyās in the three sivanas for the sviştakt offering are Rg. III. 28. 1. 4 and 5 respectively. The maitr.. Varupa's praiga to the hot; and the latter's formula before the offering is made are given in the note below.1886 The adhvaryu makes the principal offering into fire and then tho sviştakst. Portions of the remainder are cut off for tbe Brahmā priest, ida lg cut off and placed on the seat of the hots and the rest is kept securely for the sacrificer. 

Then offerings of soma from the cups are made to the joint deities ( dvidevatya grahas ) viz. for Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varupa, and the two Akvins. After this comes camasonnayana. The upnetf fills to the west of the uttaravedi nine camasas for the priests called oamasādhvaryus, by first pouring in each some soma from the dronakalaša (this is upastarana ), then soma from the pūtabhrt trough and then again from the dropakalasa (this is abhighārapa). The order in which the nine are filled is : first that of hots, then for brahmi, udgāts, sacrificer, maitrāvaruņa, brāhmaṇāoobamsin, potr, Deştr, āgni. dhra (there is none for unnetę and acohāvāka here). The maitrāvaruņa repeats Rg. I. 16, VII. 21 and IV. 35 in the three savanas respectively when the camasas are being filled ( Aśy. V. 5. 14). Then follows sukrāmanthi-pracāra. The adhvaryu takes the soma cup called Sukra, the pratiprasthat the Manthin cup and the camasadhyaryus the camasas that are placed on the uttaravedi. The camasadhvaryus are not ļtviks chosen by the yajamiga but they are assistants chosen by the priests (the ptviks themselves). Vide Jai. III. 7. 27. Jai. (III. 7.26-27) further says

that they are generally ten. They (adhvaryu and pratipras. thats) cover the cups with two pieces of wood (obiselled off when the yūpa was made ) that are sprinkled with holy water, wipe the cups from their mouths downwards with two pieces of the yüpa, but not sprinkled ) saying 'wiped off is Sanda'(adhvaryu says) and 'wiped off is Marka' (saya pratiprasthāts). They place the cups on the south and north corners of the western side of the uttaravedi, go to the south and north of the yüpa, throw away the unsprinkled chips (referring to the repulse of Sanda and Marka )997 outside the vedi and the sprinkled ones are placed into the dhavaniya and standing on both sides of the yūpe they two offer the cups with their faces to the west and the cama sādhvaryus ( who are nine here and ten in other cases, vide com. on Kat. IX. 11. 2) do the same with faces to the east and silently. All these offerings are made to Indra (com. on Kāt. IX. 11. 2). The pratiprasthātr pours what remains in the manthin cup into the sukra cup and the adhvaryu pours the mixture of the soma juice remnants of the two cups into the hotr-camasa. The adhvaryu directs attendants to refill the cups of the maitrāvarupa, brāhmaṇāo-chamsin, potr, nestr and agoldhra with soma from the dronakalaśa and the contents are offered into fire respectively for Mitra and Varuna, Indra, Maruta, Traştr. Agni. Then the hotr, adhvaryu and prati prasthatpartake of the remnants of the contents of the cups offered to the double deities (Indra and Vāyu, Mitra and Varuna, the two Asvins). Vide Ap. XII. 25. 13. A keen controversy is carried on in the sutras whether the adhvaryu or hot drinks first. Vide Ap. XII. 24. 6, Kat. IX. 11. 12–17. The contents of the cup for Indra-vāyu are drunk twice and of the rest once. The mantra in all cases of the drinking of soma by the priests is 'vāgdevi juşāņā somasya trpyatu saha prāñena svaha' (Vaj. S. VIII. 37, Ap. XII. 24. 11. 12, Kat. IX. 11. 19, Aøv. V. 6. 22). The remnants in the cups are poured into hotr camasa Tben a very small part of the purodaśa is thrown 

2597. It is rather strange thot Prof. A, B, Keith says (in 'Religion and Pbilosopby of the Veda' part 2 p. 329 ) then are filled the goblets of the priests and offerings of the sukra and manthin cups made for tho strango figures of Sanda and Marka'. As shown above the offerings of dukra aod manthia wore made to Indra. Baud. VII. 14 says pasa PER IF TUA! Hitta ... HAT FIT Yatra frittel. Āp. XII. 23. 8 has tho samo verso.

into the aindra-vyava cup by the adhvaryu, a portion of the payasyā in the maitrāvaruna cup and the dhāpa in the aśvina cup. Vide Jai. III. 8. 33 (where it is said that this effects & sampkāra of the purodada &o). The pratiprasthāt then keeps these cups on the northern wheel-track of the southern havirdhana cart. The adhvaryu and other priests make an offering of Vajina ( Kat. IX. 12. 1). The several priests drink soma from their camasas ( in a rather complicated mander, for which vide com. on Kāt, IX. 12. 3 and Ap. XII. 25. 16-23). The hotr drinks once from all camasas and twice from his own camasa, the maitrāvarung and other priests drink from their own camasas twice ( Ap. XII. 25. 19-21 ). *898 On drinking, soma the priests touch their mouth and heart with Rg. VIII. 48. 3-4'we drank soma and have become immortal &o.' Vide Ašv. V. 8. 26. All the camages are then strengthened or reple nished (āpyāyana ) by the priests by repeating two mantras *apyāyasva' &o. (Rg. I. 91. 16 and 18 = Vāj. S. XII. 112-113, Tai. S. III. 2. 5.3) and by filling them with some from the pūtabhịt trough and then they are placed under the southern havirdbāna oart to the west of the axle and are thence-forward oalled Narasamga till the taking up of the Vaišvadeva cup ( Ap. XII. 25. 24-27, Kat. IX. 15.5-8). The adhvaryu takes & small portion of the purodaśa and while giving it to the acchāvāka priest who sits outside the sadas in front of the seat ( dhişpys) prepared for him says 'O acchāvāka, say whatever you have to say.' The acchāvāka holding the portion on a lovel with his mouth recites the three verses, Rg. V. 25. 1-3 (aocbā vo agnimavase &c.). He combines the 'om' uttered at the end of the third verse with a long prose formula2599 (nigada) which ends with 'O brāhmana! call us who are brāhmaṇas'. The adhvaryu on hearing this requests the hotę to summon the acchā vāka (to the soma drink). When the hotf calls him, the acchāyaka 

2598. The com. on Kāt, IX. 11. 23 states that the contents of tho fotoys are not actually drunk, but only smelt or only brought in contact with the lips. When vessels are fillod with the sacred soma no quostion arises as to ucchipta a m mattiat Forrei TAR

recites Rg. VI. 42 and a camasa is filled for him first with soma from the droņakalaša, then from the pūtabhột trough and again, from the droņakalasa. After the acchāvāka recites Rg. VIII. 38.7 ( as the yājya ) the adhvaryu makes an offering of soma from his camasa in the Ahavaniya, the acchāvāka lays down the piece of purodaśa and sitting on his own seat drinks the re mainder of soma himself from his camaga and also eats the portion of purodāsa given to him (A$v. V. 7.7 and 9). His camasa is then placed among the other camasas. 

After the acchāvāka sits down, the brahms, bots, adhvaryu, maitrāvaruņa and āgnidhra partake of the idā of the savaniya cake and the other four offerings in the agnidhra shed ( Āp. XII. 25. 8-15, Ašv. V, 7. 10, Kat. IX. 11. 29 and IX, 12. 16 ). The sacrificer also partakes of it and the wife partakes of light food (rice &o.) in her shed (Kāt. IX. 12. 16-17, com. on Ap. XII. 25. 12). Ap. (XII. 25. 13) states that at this time take place several of the acts that are done in the darśapürnamāsa such as throwing the sakhā on fire, the offering of vājina, the two bomas of pigtalepa and phalikarana &o. 

Then comes the offering of Țiugrahas. These cups are filled from the droņakalaśa and are offered by the adhvaryu and the pratiprasthatp to the twelve months (Madhu, Madhava, and so on, from Tai. S. I. 4. 14 or Vāj. S. VII. 30 ) or 13 months ( when there is an intercalary month called Samgarpa in Tai. 8. I. 4. 14. 1 and Amhasaspati in Vāj. S. VII. 30 ) or 14 ( vide Ap. XII. 27.1). There are 6 pairs of months, for the first of whioh the offering is made by the adhvaryu and for the 2nd by the prati prasthātr with the mantra (Vāj S. VII. 30) 'upay&magļhitosi madhave tva' (and so on). Baud. VII. 16 gives at length all the mantras for the twelve months. The praigas are uttered by the maitrāvaruņa and when the adhvaryu enters the bavir dhana pavilion to make the offering the pratiprasthātr leaves it and vice versa. The vaşatkāra for the first six is uttered respectively by hots, pots, Bestr, āgnidhra, brāhmaṇāochamsin and maitrāvarupa and the adhvaryu or pratiprastbātf ( as the case may be ) eats of the remains in the cup with that priest who utters the vaşatkāra. In the next four the vaşatkāra is uttered by botę, potr, nestr and acchāvāka and for the last two by hots. After this & cup is filled from the dronakalaba or pūtabhịt for Indra and Agni (Ap. XII. 27. 8, Kat. IX. 13. 20). All the soma pātras from which soma was drunk by the priests are washed on the mārjallya place (Ap. VII. 27. 10).

It would not be out of place to remark here that according to the Ait. Br. 35. 2-4 (referred to on p. 140 above) a kşatriya sacrificer was not to drink soma, but if he desired he might drink the liquid obtained by pounding the young sprouts of the banyan tree and the fruits of that tree and of the udumbara and of other holy trees mixing them with curds.2600 It is however to be noted that in classical Sanskrit literature some times kings are desoribed as 'somapāh'. The sūtras (0. g. Sat. VIII. 7. p. 88%, Ap. XII. 24.5) say the same. Jai. (III. 5. 47-51 ) refers to this practice and says that the liquid so pre pared and poured into a cup is called phala-camasa and is really an offering made on a coal taken from the āhavaniya to its north, and not a mere substitute for some eatable. Vide also Jai. III. 6. 36. 

The adhvaryu with the stu cup in his hand sits down near the door of the sadas in front of the hot; with his face to the east. mutters the words "Idā, the summoner of gods' ( Tai, 8. III. 3. 2. 1). Then the hots performs japa of a long passage for (found in Asv. V. 9. 1), he issues without uttering biskāra a call ( ābava) to the adbvaryu loudly viz.

The most common pratigara uttered by the adhvaryu is mtumatto (pronounced asar) while at the first ahāva it is the one given above in the text. Vids Āāv. V. 9. 4-10, Ap. XII. 27. 11-17, Sat.

* tāąpinsarisa.' The adhvaryu stands up or bends his body with his face to the west at the door of the sadas and makes the response (praligara ) with somsāmo daiva' (Aøv. V. 9.5). There are several ahāvas and several pratigaras in the course of reciting all the texts connected with a sastra. The tūşnim samsa is of three olauses or six clauses ( vide below ). 3603 Then he loudly repeats twelve clauses called nivid, pausing at the end of each clause 'fire kindled by the gods, kindled by Manu...... the hotf chosen by the gods...... May the god bring the gods bither, may the god worsbip the gods, may he, Jata vedas, perform the rites' (Ait. Br. X. 2, Ašv. V, 9, 12). 3804 The Ait. Br. explains these clauses, says that they are to be loudly recited and calls them a puroruc for Jātavedas ( Ait. Br. X. 7). This nivid is not to be combined with the Tüşplísarsa, but the last word of the former is to be combined with the first Verse of the Ājya sastra, which is the name of the hymn Rg. III. 13 ( verses 1m). The first verse of this hymn is reoited

At the end of the sixth verse the hot; repeats the abava ( so3mgāvo3m ) and the adhvaryu responds with the pratigara 'so3msāmo daiva.' And then the botę recites the 7th verge of Rg. III. 13 ( wbich being the last verse of the sastra is called paridhāniyā, Āśv. V. 9.23 ). At the end of the sastra, the adhvaryu responds with the word 'om' (Ašv. V. 9,10). After the recitation of the sastra the hotę mutters 'the recita tion is concerned in speech; to thee for glory' (Tai, S. III. 2.9.1). The adhvaryu then takes the Aindragna cup of Soma and the camasadhvaryus take the camasas and after aśravana and pratyāsruta the adhvaryu issues a direction to hotro reciter of an uktha (i. e. sastra), repeat a yājyā verse for Sona.' Then the botę recites Rg. III. 25. 4 as the yājyā (Āśv. V. 9. 26 ) and when he utters 'vau3şat' the adhvaryu offers the soma from his oup into the dhavaniya fire and after a second vouşat is uttered (with the words 'somasyāgne vihi3 vau3şat') the camasādhvaryus only shake the Nārāśamsa oups. The adhvargu first partakes of the remnant from the soma cup and then the other priests who bave camasas eat the contents of the camasas (Ap. XII. 28. 1-3). 

It will have been noticed from the preceding description that there are six or seven elements oonnected with the recitation of the sastras: (1) the inaudible japa, (2) abāva and pratigara, (3) tûşpimsamsa, (4) the nivid or puroruk, (5) sūkta, (6) japa of words *uktham vāci' (Ašv. V. 10. 22-24 ) with certain words added that differ at different times (this is called ukthavirya ), to which the adhvaryu responds with 'ukthasāḥ' &c., (7) the yājyā ( Aøv. V. 10. 21 ).2605 Only the Tūşpımsamee does not ocour in the other sastras. 

In the Agniştoma there are twelve stotras and twelve sastras. The words sastra and stotra in their etymological senso mean' praise or laud,' but a stotra is a laud that is sung to a melody and a sastra is a laud that is only recited ( vide Sabara on Jal. VII. %. 17 ). A sastra always belongs to and follows & stotra. In the pratahsavana the hots begins his ahāva after the

udgāts makes hiỉnkāra in the stotra he chants and in the other two savanas the hotę does 80 after the pratihāra element of the stotra ( Asv. V. 10. 1-3 ) when the prastotr draws his attention by uttering the word 'eşā' (this) at the time of the prastāva of the last verse in the stotra. 2908 The ajyasastra is the first Sastra in the Agnistoma and the agnimāruta is the last Jai. (II. 1. 13-29 ) establishes that when the vedio text says 'he recites the prauga sastra ' or 'be chants the ājya stotra,' what is meant is not that these stotras and sastras are merely some subordinate matters in connection with the devatā of the rite, but they are really principal matters. In X. 4. 49 Jai. states that in the Agnistut sacrifices there is no uha of the stotras and sastras of the Agnistoma, but they are sung and recited as in Agnistoma. In the morning savana ( pressing of soma ), five stotras are chanted viz. Bahispavamāna and four Ājyastotras; in the mid-day pressing five more viz. the mādhyandina pava māna and four Prsthastotras (vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 193 n. 29 ) and in the evening pressing two stotras viz. the Arbhava pevamana and the Agniştoma-saman (viz. yajñā-yajña vo &c.). The corresponding twelve sastras are: in the morning the Ajyasastra (by hotp), Praugasastra (by hotr) and three ajyasastras (by maitrāvaruņa, brāhmaṇācchamsin and acobā vāka, these three priests being called hotrakas); in the mid day pressing the marutvatiya sastra (by hotę), nişkevalya sastra (by hots) and three more by the three assistants of the bott; in the evening pressing the two bastras are vaisvadevaśastra and āgni mārutasastra (both by the bots), The Bahişpavamāna is chanted in the Trivștstoma, the four ajyastotras and the mādbyandinapava māna in the Pancadašastoma, the four Prstha-stotras and the Arbhavapavamana in the Saptadašastoma and the yajñayajñiya in the Ekavimsastoma (vide Tandya Br. XX. 1. 1). Stoma means a group of verses and pañcadašastoma and similar words mean that the verses (usually three) are inoreased to 15, 17, 21 &c. by repetition in various patterns (which are called viễtuti). There are three viştutis of the paboadaśastoma. These patterns differ in the order and number of repetitions. The prastoty. marks the several turns, the number of verses and the order by means of small sticks & span long (called kusas ) cut from the udumbara tree and placed on 8 piece of cloth spread in the

midst of the singers. Vide Laţ. II. 6. 1-4. For example, the first ajyastotra (Rg. VI. 16. 10-12 = S. V. II. 1. 1. 4, ed. by Benfey ) is raised to fifteen verses in three paryayas (turns) of five verses each. If the three verses are denoted by a, b, o then the 15 verses will be a & abo (first paryāya), a bb bo ( 2nd paryaya ) and a booc (third paryāya). Vide Tāņdy& Br. II. 4. Tbe 2nd viştuti of the pancadaśastoma is represen ted by a a a b c, a bo, a b bbcoc and the third vişguti by 8 b c,& b b bo and a a a boco ( vide Tāndya Br. II. 5-6). The word stoma is to be distinguished from stolra. The latter is a chant of a certain number of verses set to a certain melody out of those mentioned in the gānas of the Samaveda. Stobhas are musical interjections and flourishes introduced in the saman obants such as 'bāu', 'hal', '1', 'ü', 'hum' (vide Chān. Up. I. 13). Hāu and hāi are stobhas employed in the Rathantara and Vāmadevya sāmans respectively. Jai. IX. %. 39 defines stobha as that which is in addition to the letters of the sk ( that is being chanted ) and has other varnas than those of the șk (adbikam ca vivarpam ca Jaiminiḥ stobha-sabdatvat). The word saman means, no doubt, a chant (giti), but since stobhas are necessary to bring out the melody and help in musical appreciation they are included in the connotation of the word sāman 2009 (Jai. II. 1. 36, IX. %. 34-38). Sabara states that there are a thousand (numberless) means of adding to the charm of the melody (giti), which only conveys certain notes produced by internal effort and which is denoted by the word sāman. The chant has a fixed extent and is sung on & şk verse. In order to effectuate that chant resort is made to change of letter (as in ognāyi' for 'agna' in'agna āyābi vitaye), to stobha and the other devices stated below 1608. Since the pk verses are

sung to a certain melody the šks are the skeleton, the notes of the melody are the flesh that clothes the bare bones, they are. super-imposed over the çk, and the stobhas are embellishments or flourishes like the hair on one's body. This very apt and happy figure is employed by the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmaṇa to illustrate the relationship of the pks, the notes and the stobhas. 1809 Each saman chant is primarily connected with certain verses, 0. g. when we speak of Rathantara without more the verses meant are Rg. VII. 32.22-23 abhi tvā gūra &0.= 

8. V. II. 1, 1. 11 ( Benfey) and 8. V. vol. III. pp. 83-84 (B. I. series); and when one refers to the Vamadevya sāman without further qualification the verses intended are Rg. IV. 31. 1-3 ( kaya nascitra abhuvat) = 8. V. II. 1. 1. 12 ( Benfey) and 8. V. vol. III. pp. 87-89 (B. I.). These are called the own ( svakiya ) verses of the respective sāmans ( vide com. on Drāhyāyaṇa II. 1. 1) and that one verso oocurring in the pūr vāroika part of the Sāmaveda, which is the first in the saman as set out in the Uttarārcika portion, is called the yoni of the sāman (Jai. VII. %. 17 and Sabara thereon). But the verses that are the own verses of & saman can be sung to another melody. Tāņdya XV. 10. 1 says 'the kavati verses' are the verses' kaya našoitra &c.' which are the svakiya verses of the Vamadevya. When some texts say 'he chants the Rathantara on the Kavati verses' what is meant is that, not minding the Vāmadevya melody to which the verses "kaya nascitra &o.' primarily attach themselves, they are to be sung to the Rathan tara melody in that particular rite. So the word sāman as applied to Rathantara, Bphat, Raivata and others means simply & melody and not one or more pk verses that are bung 2010 ( vide Jai. IX. 2. 1-2). 

Jaimini deals in about 60 adhikaranas with matters arising out of the relation of the Samaveda to sacrifices in V. 3, IX, 1, IX. 2, X 5-6 and elsewhere. Some of the conclusions are very interesting and may be briefly indicated; viz. the üha. grantha is of human authorship (IX. 2. 1-2), the fk is principal and the melody is an attribute of it ( IX. 2. 3-13 ), the whole

melody is to be sung on each pk of the sāman (IX. 2. 14-20 ), the verses of a siman should as far as possible be in the same metre ( IX. 2. 21-22 ), the fk verses set out in the Uttarārcika are to be taken for singing the melody on (IX, %. 23–24), that two verses have to be arranged as three by repetition of the 4th or last pada in certain melodies (IX. 2. 25-27), that in the Yajñāyajñlya sāman for the words 'girā girā' in the original 'irā irā' has to be substituted in the melody (IX. 1. 50-51 ). 

After the recitation of the sastra and the partaking of remnants of soma the adhvaryu takes the Vaišvadeva cup, fills it from the droņakalaśa, touches it with two kusa blades, hands over the blades to the prastotp priest and urges the saman priests to chant a stotra. This is the mode in all cases of dhurya stotras. Stotras other than the Bahişpavamāna are chanted near the Audumbar/ post in the sadas; the prastot: sits facing the west bebind the adhvaryu, the udgātr sits to his west facing the north, and the pratihartr sits facing udgāts, but looking towards the south-east ( Tāņdya VI. 4. 14, Drāhyāyana III. 3. 28). The stotra chanted after the Vaišvadeva cup is taken and the three following ones are called ajyastotras2011 (com. on Ap. XII. 28. 6). The 2nd sastra is called prauga ( Asv. V. 10. 6 ) which is recited after the taking up of the Vaišvadera cup and is supposed according to the Ait. Br. XI. 2 to confor food. This sastra is made up of Rg. I. 2 and 3 (in all 21 verses), which are divided into seven triplets addressed to seven deities in order viz. Vāyu, Indra-vāyu, Mitra and Varuņa, Ašvins, Iudra, Viśve Devas, Sarasvati. Each of the seven triplets is proceded by a verse called puroruk. The first puroruk is pro ceded by 'bim' and 'bhûr-bhuvaḥ svaro 3m. 2018 The 2nd verse of Rg. I. % is repeated thrice ( and not the first as is usual, com. on Āśv. V. 10.6). At the end of the recitation the priest mutters

(Ch. XXXIII 

"ukthar vāci slokāya tva' (instead of 'ghosāya tvā'), and Rg. I. 14. 10 is the yajya of the Prauga-sastra. This oup is' offered and the remnants of it and of the camasas are drunk by the priests. Then from the Ukthyasthall containing some a third is taken for filling three cups to Mitra and Varuņa, Indra, and Indra-Agni. Stotras and sastras follow at each of these three oups, the castras being repeated respectively by the maitrāvaruņa, brāhmaṇācobaṁsin and acchāyāka. For want of space all these three sastras cannot be set out at length here. Ašv. V. 10. 26 very succintly inctioates them. Each of these sastras has four parts, (1) a triplet called stotriya (because those very verses have been chanted in the corresponding stotra ); () then another triplet called anurūpa which should agree in metre, deity and even the sage (according to some) with the stotriya triplet (AŚy. V. 10. 26-27 ); (3) the core or principal part of the bastra, hence called uktba-mukha (vide Sāń. VII. 11. 3); (4) a yājyā verse. For example, in the maitrāvaruņa sastra, Rg. III. 62. 16-18 constitute the stotriya triplet (those three verses are chanted as the 2nd ajyastotra), Rg. V. 71.1-3 form the anurūpa triplet, Rg. V. 68. 1-5 and Rg. VII. 66. 1-9 are the uktha-mukha and Rg. VII. 66. 19 is the yājyā of the sastra. This brings the prāta savana to an end, and the adhva ryu makes an offering at the end with the words 'May Agni protect us in the morning savana'. At the bidding of the adhvaryu the maitrāvaruņa asks all the priests to come out of the sadas and they come out by the way they went in. 

Then before the madhyandina savana begins the priests again enter the sadas, and the yajamāna enters by the eastern door. The procedure of the mid-day pressing is in main out lines the same as that of the morning one (Ap. XIII.1.2). There is no hurry in the first two pressings, but the third press ing is got through with speed (Ap. XII. 29. 12). There are a few points of difference. In the mid-day pressing there are no cups for the joint deities (dvidevatya grabas), no oups for the seasons (Ap. XIII. 1. 4). The great pressing is done as in the morning pressing, but in a loud voice (Ap. XIII. 1.8). In this pressing the vasatiyarl waters are taken in the hotsoamasa, are handed over to the yajamāna and become the nigrābhyā for pressing soma. The oloth in which soma stalks are tied is loosened and given for wearing as a turban to the priest called grāvastut and it is taken back from him after he recites the praise of the crushing stone (Ap. XIII. 1. 5 and com.). The cups taken are five, viz. bukra and manthin, agrayana, two marutvatlya and ukthya 

Ch. XXXIII) 

Agniştoma-Madhyandina-savana 

1187 

( also taken either before both marutvatiya oups or between the two). The grāvastut (praiser of the stones used in crushing soma stalks ) enters the havirdhāna pavilion by the eastern door, throws away a blade of kuša on & spot which is to the north-east of the northern point of the axle of the southern havirdbāna cart and stands opposite the soma stalks with face to the south-east. He takes the cloth in his joined hands, folds it round his head and face from left to right thrice (so as to make it look like a turban). When the stalks of some are placed for being crushed he should recite certain verses by the middle tone (Asv. V. 12. 7–8), which is the tone for all vedic texts in the mid-day pressing. The texts repeated by the grāvastut are ( Ăśv. V. 12. 9-11): Rg. I. 24. 3, V. 81. 1, VIII. 81. 1, VIII. 1. 1, X. 94 (this hymn is called Arbuda ), Rs. X. 76 and 175. Before the last verse of Rg. X. 94, the two hymns Rg. X. 76 and X. 175 are recited. Either between the latter two hymns or after them or before them he recites as many pavamāna verses as are required up till the taking up of the cups, finishes the last verse of Rg. X. 94 and hands back the turban to the saorificer. Ašv, further directs that from the hymn Rg. X. 94 which has 14 verses the 4th is taken out and the last is the paridhaniya (the finishing verse ) and the rest ( 12 verses) are divided into four triplets and each of the triplets is either preceded or followed by & triplet out of the following viz. Rg. I. 91, 16-18, IX. 8. 4, IX. 15. 8, IX. 107. 21, VIII. 72. 8, VIII. 72. 16, IX. 17. 4, IX. 67. 14-15 ( which together come to twelve verses ). The four triplets are respectively recited by the grāvastut at the time of sprinkling water on the soma stalks, pounding with the hands, extracting juice, and collecting the soma juice in the adhavaniya trough ( Āýv. V. 12. 15-19). In the mid-day pressing the place of the Babişpavamāna is taken by the Madhyandina-pavamāna stotra ( Āp. XIII. 3. 7). This stotra consists of Rg. IX, 61, 10-12, X. 107. 4-5, X. 87. 1-3, that is Sāmaveda II. 1. 1. 8-10 ( Benfey ) and S. V. vol. III. pp. 22-23, 41-42, 78-80. The yajamāns mutters several texts before the madhyandina pavamāng is chanted and during its chanting 

(Ap. XIII. 3.1). 

After the chanting of the Mādhyandina-pavamana comes the rite called Dadhigharma, if the sacrificer has performed the Pravārgya rite ( Asv. V. 13. 1). The pratiprasthātę brings ourds in the ladle ( sruo) made of udumbara ; the curds are heated on the dgnidhriya fire. The hotf when asked' is the

Then the pasupurodasa ( of the animal killed in the morning ) and the other offerings (such as purodaśa on eleven potsherds ) are made and the remnants eaten. Then ten camagas are filled (including that of acohāvaka ). Then offerings of some from the sukra and manthin cups are made respectively by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthāts and the camasādhvaryus offer the soma taken in their camasas and the remnants are partaken by the priests. After this come the offerings of ajya called dakşiņāhuti or 

dākşina homa ( Kat. X. 1, 4., Sat. IX. 2. p. 910). The procedure - here resembles the Vaisarjina homa described above (p. 1158). Gold is tied by the hem of the garment that covers the yajamāna and his family, it is placed in the ajya contained in the juhū, and two ahutis are offered with 'udu tyam' (Rg. I. 50.1 ) and 'citram (Rg. I. 115. 1) in the gārhapatya fire, the piece of gold is taken out and the yajamāna holding that gold piece and djya in his hand approaches the dakşiņās (the various articles that constitute the fee) placed to the south of the mabāvedi. Vide Sat. Br. IV. 3. 4 about dakşiņā ( derived from 'dakşay' to invigorate) where it is stated that no priest should officiate at a soma sacrifice for a fee less than one hundred cows. Āp. (XIII, 5. 1XIII. 7. 15) gives numerous rules about the dakşiņā to be distributed among the sixteen priests. The dakşiņā may consist of 7, 21, 60, 100, 112, or 1000 cattle or an unlimited number or a man may give all his wealth except the share of the eldest son2015 and when he gives & thousand cattle or all his wealth he has to give one mule in addition ( Ap. XIII. 5. 1-3). He may also give goats, sheep, horges, slaves, an elephant, olothes, chariots, corn of various kinds, assos. A man may give his own daughter in marriage ( in the daiva form ) as fee (Adv. V. 13. 7). With regard to the cows meant as fee Ap. states that the yajamāna drives them with the black antelope skin so as to form them into four groups. One group (i. e. of the whole number ) is given to the adhvaryu and his assistants 

2013. Prof. Keith in Religion and Pbilosopby of the Veda' part 2 p. 330 days after which the fees should be givon consisting of 7, 21... ... cattle or all the sacrificer's goods save his oldest son'. He obviously inoang save his oldest son's sharo'. 

Ch. XXXIII) 

Agnistoma-distribution of dakşiņā 

1189 

in such a way that the pratiprasthatę, nestr and unnets receive respectively half, one-third and one-fourth of what the adhvaryu gets; that is, as stated by Kat. X. 2. 25 and the com. on Ap. XIII. 2. 12, twelve cows are given to each of the four principal priests, 6, 4 and 3 respectively to each of their assistants in the order stated above in note 2228 (supposing one hundred cows are to be distributed ). Jai. ( as indicated below ) and Manu VIII, 210 refer to this rule of distribution. The āgnidhra is the first recipient of gifts, receiving a piece of gold, pürņapātra and a pillow woven with threads of all colours. The pratihartis the last recipient ( Āp. XIII. 6. 2, Kāt. X. 2. 39). Gifts are made to the priests while they sit inside the sadas and to the adhvaryu and his assistants in the havirdhāna pavilion. To s brahmana of the Atri gotra ( who is not a stvik) a gold piece is given before everybody else or after the ag nidhra ( Ap. XIII. 6. 12, Kāt. X. 2. 21 ). After the āgnidhra come brahmā, udgāts and hotr ( Kāt. X. 2. 26 ). Apart from the gifts meant for the ftviks something is given accord ing to ability and inclination to the camasādhvaryus, the sadasya and to sight-seers in the sadas ( they are called prasar pakas), except to those who belong to the Kanva or Kasyapa gotra or those who ask for a gift (Ap. XIII.7.1-5, Kāt. X. 2.35). Ap. (XIII. 7.6-7 ) says that generally no gift is to be given to one who is not a brāhmana, but a gift may be given to a non-brāhmaṇa who knows the Vedic lore, while no gift is to be made to a brāhmaṇa who is not learned. Kāt. X. 2. 38 states that the wife also joins in inaking gifts. After the anuvākya is repeated by the maitrāvaruņa for the marutvatiya cup to be described below no gifts are made (Ap. XIII. 7, 14, Kat. X. 3,2). On making the gifts the sacrificer does obeisance (namaskāra ) to the priests and utters an invocation as to ani. mals donated in the words who gave to whom ? "8814 Drāhyā. yana (V, 3. 14-19 ) states that before accepting a gift every priest murmurs the famous mantra "I take thee at the impulse of god Savitr.... &c. (Tāņdya I. 8.1 ) and after receiving the gift each donee murmurs 'who gave to whom' (Tāndya I. 8. 17). The gifts are taken away by the path between the āgnidhriya sbed and the sadas and then by the tirtha (Drāhy. yana V. 3. 13). Jai. ( X. 2. 22-28 ) declares that the making of gifts to the priests is not merely a formal sot as part of the gaorificial rites, but is intended to induce the priests to give

their services in return for the gifte. In Jai. X. 3. 39-49 it is conoluded that in the words 'the dakşiņā is 112' the vedic text refers only to cows and not to the various kinds of corns, in X. 3. 50-52 that the division of the gifts is to be made by the sacrificer and not left to be done by the priests and that all the priests do not share equally, but acoording to the Vedic texts some get half (they are ardhinaḥ ), others one-third ( they are called tftiyinaḥ) and still others one-fourth ( X. 3.53-55). Jai. XII. 1. 32 states that as valuable gifts are given in Somayaga, there is no rice cooked (called anvāhārya) for the priests in the iştis of Somayāga as there is in daršapārņamāsa (note 2390 ). 

When the gifts are taken away by the priests the sacrificer casts away the antelope horn in the cātvāla pit with two mantras ( Ap. XIII. 7. 16 ). Jai. ( IV. 2. 16-19 ) says that this casting away is the final disposal of the horn (it is & pratipatti karma) and (in XI. 3. 13-14 ) that this casting takes place on the last day in sacrifices like the Drādaśaba. The adhvaryu offers five offerings of ajya called Vaišvakarmaņa ( i. e. for Vigvakarman) in the āgnidhra fire with five mantras from Tai. S. III. 2. 8. 1-3 (Ap. XIII, 7. 17 and Sat. IX. 2. p. 911). The adhvaryu and the pratiprasthātr take two cups for ( Indra ) Marutvat and offer them. The remnants of the oup in prati prasthātr's hand are poured in the adhvaryu's cup; from this mixture a portion is poured in the cup of the pratiprasthāts. The priests partake of the remnants. Then a third Marutvatiya cup is taken to the accompaniment of the bastra called marutvatiya2018

recited by the hotr (Ap. XIIL8.2)and at the end of the recita tion of that kastra it is offered. Then & cup for Mahendra is taken. The stotra for Mahendra is called Prstha,ton and is chanted at this time, being sung in Ratha ntara melody ( Lat. II. 9.7, Asv. V. 15. 2-3). Then follows the Niskevalya sastra by the hotr. After the Mahendra cup is offered, the pratiprasthātr, nesty and unnetr take up three grahas (cups ) called Atigrāhya respectively for Agni, Indra and Sūrya ( Āp. XIII. 8. 7-9). Then three Ukthya cups are offered as in the morning pressing. Then three Přsthastotras 28 17 are chanted, 

2616. The Rg. verses of the Rathantara saman are (VII. 32.22-23); अभि त्वा शूर नोनुमोऽदुग्धा इव धेनवः । ईशानमस्य जगतः स्वदशमीशानमिन्द्र तस्थुषः ॥ न वावा अन्यो दिव्यो न पार्थिवो न जातो न निष्यते । अश्वायन्तो' मघवनिन्द्र वाजिनो' गव्यन्तस्त्वा हवामहे ॥. These two are respectively.in the Brhati and Paikti metres and together constitute a Barhate Pragatha. Vido Jai. IX.2. 25-28 and Sabara thereon. In chanting these to the Rathantara inelody they are to be made into threo, by repeating the 4th pada of the first with the first half of the 2nd verse and the last of this with the latter half of Rg. VII. 32. 23. The wai Ms. writes it as follows: हुम् । आभित्वा शूर नोनुमो' वा । ॐ मादुग्धौ इव धेनवे ईशानमन्य जगतः सुवा २ ३ दृशाम् । आ ईशानमा २ ३ इन्द्रा ३ । संस्थू २ ३ ४ षां ओवा ६ होउवा ॥ अस् ॥ 'ईशोवा । ओं' नामिन्द्रसुस्थुषो' न त्वावा अन्यो' दिवियोः न पा २ ३ र्थिवाः । ने जातो नौ २ ३ जौ ३ । नो यिष्या २ ३ ४ ताउं वो ६ हाउवा । अस् ॥ नै जोवा । ॐ तो न जैनिष्यते' अश्वोयन्तो' मघवन्निन्द्र वा २ ३ जिनोः । गेव्यन्तस्त्वा २ ३ हा ३ । वामा २ ३ ४ हो ओ' वा ६ हाँ उवा । अंस || The Wai Ms inserts after जगतः, rapra, H997 certain falas in which the letter 27 occurs several times e.g. 

ओं वाग्भा भाभि भभ भभ भी' भी भभभभभभः । (after जगव:). This is probably in accordance with लाट्यायनश्रौत VII. 11.6-8, ताण्डप. VII. 6. 11 says that अम् is the निधन of रथन्तर; vide ताण्ड्य VII. 7. 1 and 3 for प्रस्ताव and पति हार of रथन्तर. The Ms. in the Bombay Asiatic Society's Library places the letter fra' wherever in the other two there is a vertical stroke and it has no figure over him' and 'om.' There are a few other differences also (not noted here). In the B. I. edition ( Vol. III. p. 85) the scheme is a good deal different as the following (only the first verse is taken) will show: अभित्वा शूर नोनुमाः । अदुग्धा आयि । वा३ धायिनो ३ वाः ईशान मस्य जगतः सुवई । शौ २ ३ ४ मैं ही। ईशाना २ ३ ४ मी । सू ३ आउवा २३ । ऐ३ । स्थुषऔ॥

each followed respectively by the gastras recited by the maltra Varuņa, brāhmaṇāocharisin and acohā vāka. This closes the mid-day pressing of soma. 

The evening pressing commences with the taking of the Aditya cup ( a cup the deity of which is Aditi). In the third pressing the Vedic texts are to be uttered in the highest tone (Asy. V. 17. 1). The procedure in this pressing resembles that of the mid-day pressing (Sat. V. 3. p. 915). The adhvaryu, the sacrificer, the pratiprasthats, āgnidhra and unnetz enter the havirdhāna shed by the eastern door and the wife enters by the western door ( Kāt. X. 3. 2-3). The doors of the havirdhana shed are shut when there are many persons sitting inside the vedi ( Āp. XIII. 9. 2, Sat. IX. 3, p. 915). The adbyaryu takes into the Aditya cup a part of the remnants of the some from the cups for the joint deities. In the middle or western part of the āditya cup he adds ourds and then again takes the whole of the remnants of the soma from the cups for the joint deities (that has been poured in the ādity asthall). He stirs the contents of the oup with the upūinsusavana stone used in crushing the soma stalks and mixes them well together. He then takes out the stone and places it among the stones used for crushing soma stalks. The āditya cup is not placed down, but is covered with darbhas or with the right hand of the adhvaryu, who comes out after the doors of the havirdbāna are opened, takes it to the uttara vodi, stirs the contents with darbhas in such a way that a few drops fall down out of the cup. After the usual praişa and the other procedure the adhvaryu throws the darbhas on the ābavenlya and offers the contents of the aditya cup into fire. At the time of offering the contents and also immediately after doing so he does not look at the offering but looks elsewhere ( Āsv. V. 17. 3). He does not partake of the remnants of soma in the aditya oup but keeps it with the remnants of soma therein among the several Vessels. He puts on the filşa ( the dregs of some stalks ) that is left after the two pressings the stalks ( amśu ) that are in the adābhya vessel and the upāmbupātra and silently extracts goma juice therefrom. In the agnidhra shed the sacrificer's wife prepares by churning 'asir'(milk mixed with soma) and enters the havirdhana shed by the western door. The yajamāna enters by the eastern door, spreads on the mouth of the pūtabhrt trough the strainer and pours thereon along with his wife the ātir with four mantras ( Tai, S. III. 2. 8. 4-5). He

fills the agrayana cup from four streams (the fourth being from the remnants of some in the ādityapātra ), while in the mid-day pressing there are only three streams (Sat. IX. 3. p. 918, Ap. XIII. 10, 11). In this pressing no turban is given to the grāvastut priest. Then the Viprud.dhoma is performed. The Arbhava 2018 pavamāna is then chanted on the lines of the Madhyandina pavamāna. - 

The havis prepared from the various limbs of the (savaniya) pasu sacrificed in the morning is then offered (Ap. XIII. 11. 3, Āsv. V. 17, 4). After the idā is partaken of by the hotę, the purodaša ( cake baked on 12 potsherds, Sat. IX. 3. p. 920) is offered to Indra and the rest of the procedure up to the laying down of the Narahamsa cups is followed. Then soma of the third pressing is offered by the adhvaryu from the hotfoamasa and by the camasādhvaryus from their camasas and as else where the priests and camasādhvaryus partake of the remnants. After the Nārāśamga cups are laid down each of the prieste who drink sonia from camasas takes from the softest part of the puroda a three small balls (or pills ), places them on the ground to the south of his own camasa and they then offer them to their own father, grand-father and great-grand-father with the appropriate mantras 2618 ( Āp. XIII. 12. 9, Āsv. V. 17. 5). They mutter the namaskāra mantras ( vide note 2438 above) and the sacrificer utters the Sad-dhoti mantras (Ap. XIII. 1%. 

2618. The tbird pressing is connected with the Rbius as the praisa of the adhvaryu shows: gatunet FTTETTHET faha: pynt \#: aivan पतो वृहस्पतिवतो विपदेपावतस्तीवों आशीर्वत इन्द्राय सोमान्पस्थितान्प्रेष्य (Sat. Ix.3. p. 921, Ap. XIII. 12. 2). The Rbbus are threo viz. Ķbbu, Vibb v& and Vāja (Rg 1. 161. 6 and IV. 39. 3, IV. 34. 1) and their exploits are narrated in Rg. 1. 20, I. 110 and 111, I. 161, Rg. IV, 33-37 &o. The Ait. Br. ( 28. 4 ) narrates the myth that the Rbbus were mortals but were made immortal by Prajapati and were given a sbare in the third pressing. It is therefore that the first stotra in the third prossing is called Arbhava-pavamina. This mater is constituted by Rg. IX. 1. 1-4, IX. 108. 1-2, IX. 106. 1-3, IX. 101. 1-3, IX. 75. 1-3-Sümaveda II. I. 1. 16–19 ( Benfey) or 8. V. vol. III pp. 105-107, 115-116, 121-123, 131-133, 166-169. 

2619. Vide note 2485 for the mantras. Āév. and Lat. II. 10. 4 gay the pantra is not for AnTyre Tur TATTUTTARI,' Kat. X. 5. 11 notes that the procedure of Pinda pitryajõ& froin pizdadana to smelling the pipdas is observed but without water and (in X, 6. 12) gives it as his opinion that it is really the yajamina's ancestors that are offered pieces of the purodāsa and not those of the oa masadhvaryus.

History of Dharmafāstra (Ch. XXXIII 10-11 ) which are in Tai. Ar. III. 4. Then the Savitra cup is offered (Ap. XIII. 13. 1, Aśv. V. 18.1). The Vai vadova oup is thereafter filled from the Pütabhột trough, but there is no stotra obanted for this oup; the vaiśvadeva sastra however is recited by the hotr (Asv. V. 18. 5-13). Then rice ( caru) is boiled for being offered to god Soma. The adhvaryu wears the sacred thread in the prāoināvita form, cuts off to the south of the ahavaniya one oblation from the boiled rice with his right hand and another with the mekşana, crosses to the north of the abavaniya, and with his face to the south offers in the southern part of the ahavaniya fire the oblations of rice, the yajya being 'tvam soma pitbhiḥ samvidanaḥ' (Rg. VIII. 48.13). Ajya is poured on the remnants of the caru in the pot, the adhvaryu sees his face in the clarified butter ( Ašv. V. 19. 4), anoints his eyes with the djya by means of his thumb and ring finger and then hands over the pot of rice ( with ajya therein) to the three udgātę priests, who see their reflections in the ajya and if they oannot see their reflection (which is an evil omon) then more djya is poured and two mantras are repeated (Ašv. V. 19.5, one being 'bhadram karpebhih'Rg. I.89.8) and then again they look for their reflection in the djya. The āgnidhra carries lighted roots of darbhas to the several dhispyas and establishes them thereon as fires and the adhvaryu pours ajya taken afresh in a pot over them while the darbhas are glowing (Ap. XIII. 14.5-6, Sat. IX. 4 p. 929). He keeps some ājya in the pot, takes the cup called Pātnivata, 3080 fills it from the soma in the Agrayanasthall, mixes in it the ājya that remains after pouring over on the dbişnya fire-brands and offers it into the northern part of the fire. Jai. ( in III. 2. 33-37 ) lays down several pro positions about this oup viz. that it is offered only to Agni Patnivat and not also to Indra-Vāyu and other joint deities (though the soma in the agrayanasthalı had in it the remnants of the contents of the grahas for joint deities ), that, though the mantra in offering it oontains the word Tvastr("O! Agni Pat nivat I drink eoma joined with god Tvaştr') that cup of soma is offered only to Agni Patnivat and not to Tvaştp also and

that, though Rg. III. 6. 9 ( the yajya verse ) contains & prayer about the thirty-three gods, the Pātnivata is not to be supposed to be offered to them also. The adhvaryu then issues various directions to the several priests ( Ap. XIII. 14. 11, Sat. IX. 4. p. 930). The āgnidhra sits on the lap 2017 of the neste and par takes of the remnants of the Patnivata cup (Ašv. V. 19. 8, Kāt. X. 6. 24), while so sitting. He washes that oup on the mārj. llya and keeps it on the khara. The camases of the hotę and others are filled by the unnets in such a way that no soms is left, the two jars of soma are wiped with the dašās and they are all kept with mouths turned downwards. The adhvaryu starts the udgāts priests on their chant of Yajñāyajñiya stotra ( Ap. XIII. 15, 3), which is the principal stotra of the Agnistoma (Sat. IX. 4. p. 931 calls it 'Agnistoma Sīman'). All those priests who are to chant the stotra and the choristers cover thair heads together with the ears. 2428 Those who come as sight-seers into the sadas should join in the chant as choristers ( Āp. XIII. 15. 6). When the udgātr makes the binkāra of the yajñāyajālya stotra he looks at the sacrificer's wife who is brought by the nestr near the udgāty. When the nidhana (Anale) of the first verse is being sung the wife removes the garment from her right thigh and with her face to the north pours the pānnejani water on her thigh up till the prastāvs of the third stotriya of the first paryāya 4828 ( 80 es to leave no water in the jar ). The wife retires to her shed when the udgāts asks her to go or when he has looked at her thrice and she has poured water thrice ( Kāt. X. 7. 5-6). While the chant proceeds the sporificer repeats the saptahots mantras (note 2393 above). The Yajñāyajñiya saman is Rg. VI. 48. 1-2= Sāmaveda

Each priest smells his camasa ( and those who have' none smell the one nearest to them) to the west of the cātvāla or in the place (called Astāva ) where the Bahişpavamāna was obanted ( Ap.

All priests wait upon the ahavaniya with the mindā mantra 'yanma atmano mindabhūt'( whatever fault has been mine, Agni has mended it' &c. Tai. S. III. 2. 5. 4). The priests then discharge them selves from the vow made at the Tānūnaptra ceremony. Then the Patnisamyājas are performed as in the animal sacrifice (Ap. XIII. 18. 3). The adhvaryu offers with the juhu nine samiştayajus offerings in a continuous stream, standing inside the vedi, Then he performs the prayascittas for actions like spilling soma drops about and offers a savanāhuti ( i.e. an ajya offering indioating the completion of the Agnistoma). The adhvaryu issues a direction to the maitrāvarupa to urge the priests to come out of the sacrificial shed and the latter do 80.

Jaimini, however, in X.7. 47-50 lays down that the avabhrtha is a special rite and therefore all that takes place in the darśapürņamāsa işti does not follow as a matter of course. A fuel-stick is laid on fire, a veda bunch is made, kuss is strewn round the fires ( that is paris tarans), the necessary yajñapātras are placed with mouths downwards. No idhma is brought and some do not even prepare the vedi. Only four ladlings of Ajya are taken in all the ladies ( sruc). The nirvāpa is only for & cake to Varuņa on one potsherd (Ap. XIII. 19. 3). There are no pranitā waters (Sat. IX. 5. p. 938), and no girding up of the wife ( vide above p. 1040 for it). The ajya in the ladles and the grains taken out for purodašs are placed on the shoulder ( north corner on eastern side) of the uttaravedi. The sacrificer takes out from its pit the post of udumbara ( audumbari in the sadas ), places it on the hide and board used in extracting soma juice and all other utensils except the four sthālis viz. the agrayana, ukthya, aditya-otball and dhruvāsthali ( vide Tai. Br. I. 4. 1 for these four sthalls of olay ) that are smeared with soma in the space between the catvala pit and the utkara or on the northern shoulder of the vedi on the large stool ( Asandi ) used for soma.

The yajamāna casts away the antelope skin in the otvāla pit .( other ways of disposal are also mentioned in Ap. XIII. 19. 8-9). When starting for avabhrtha he offers clarified butter with 'O1 Fire, that givest life &o.' (Tai. S. I. 3. 14. 4), a second oblation with the mantra 'avabbștha, nicumpuña &o.' ( Vāj. S. VIII. 27 ).2839 

A third oblation of ajya is made to Rudra (Ap. XIII. 20.1) with 'namo Rudrāya' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 9). When starting from the vedi or from near the cātvāla with faces to the north they recite Rg. I. 24. 8 (Tai. S. 1. 4. 45. 1). The adhyaryu isgues a direction to the prastot; to chant & saman. The sāman chanted is oalled 'avabbșthasāman' (Lāt. II. 12. 1). It is 'agniştapati' (vide Sat. Br. IV.4.5.8 and Drāhyāyana śr. VI. 4.1). When the nidhana of the sāman is being sung, all the priests, the yaja. māna and his wife thrice repeat that finale. They do so a second time when they have traversed half of the distance to the reservoir of water and a third time when they reach the water ( Ap. XIII. 20. 4 and Sat. IX. 5. p. 941). The same pro. oedure is followed for the Varuņa purodāsa as in Varuņapra ghages for niskāsa. The dregs of soma are thrown into water with the branch of the udumbara tree and ourds are poured over it. All utensils smeared with soma are thrown into water (Ap. XIII. 21. 12, Kāt. X, 8. 24). Jai. (IV. 2. 19-22) says that this casting into water is merely the final disposal (pratipatti) of these utensils and the fruti passage they approach the water for the final bath with whatever is smeared with soma' does not lay down any subordinate matter about avabbstha. The girdle of the yajamāna and the yoktra, the jāla ( net on the head of the wife) and the antelope skin of the wife are dipped in water. The yajamāna invokes the water with 'devirāpaḥ' (Tai, s. I. 4. 45, 3) and enters. The deep silent waters of flowing rivers are to be preferred, but in the absence of such waters any water reservoir will do (Kāt. X.8.19). The yajamāna and the wife enter water, splash water on their heads (but do not dip them into water), rub each other's back. A handful of kuša is thrown into the water and this handful in the water serves as the ahavaniya for all abutis in avabhrtha.

The prayājas and apuyājas are offered as in darsapūrpamāsa (except to God Barhis). Jal. (XI. 2. 30-34) lays down that not, only is the principal offering of purodāsa offered into water but also all subordinate ones like Aghoras. A. portion of the purodaka for Varupa is offered therein. The rest of the purodāsa is offered to Agni and Varuna, which becomes the Sviştakst offering in this case (Kat. X. 8. 27, Sat. IX. 5 p. 944). The unnets at the direction of the adhvaryu leads all out of the water ( the yajamana or hots being the first ). The yajamina and his wife put on fresh garments and come out. The cloth with which some was enveloped is worn as a turban by the yajamāna and that in which soma stalks were tied is worn by the wife and both the pieces of cloth are donated later on in the Udavasāniya işti to the adhvaryu ( Ap. XIII. 22. 3-4). The priests, the yajamāna and the wife hold each a fuel-stick of udumbara, mutter the Mablyā pk (viz. apāma somam-araştā abhūma, Rg. VIII. 48. 3), proceed following the unnet; towards the sacrificial ground without looking baok at the water, perform mārjana in front of the cow-stable (of the Bacrificer) and place the fuel-stick (carried by each) on the ahavaniya with.edhosi &c.'(Tai, 8. I. 4. 45. 3) and wait upon that fire with 'apo anvacarişam' (Ap. XIII. 22. 6 quoting Tai. S. I. 4. 45. 3). Then follows the Udayaniyā (the concluding işti). It is performed in the prāgvanša (and not on the specially prepared uttaravedi). The procedure is like that for the prāyaniya işti (already described on p. 1140). In the same sthall (pot) in which the prāyaptyā offering was cooked and to the bottom of whiob some remnants stick be takes the offering for this işti. The wife again ties round her waist the yoktra. Prayājas are optional and if not offered no djya is taken in the juba. The yājvās and anuvākyās of the prayanlyā become respectively the anuv. kyda and ydjyds of the Udayanlyā. The order of deities is different, viz. Agni is the first, Pathy. Svasti the last for ajya offerings (Ap. XIII. 23. 4, Sat. IX. 6. p. 950, Asv. VI. 14. 3). When the Udayanıyd is finished the anubandhyā rite follows $630 (Ap. XIII. 23. 6, Sat. IX. 6. p. 951). A barren oow is to be offered to Mitra and Varuņa. The procedure is the same as that of Niradha-pašu-bandha. Some sacrificed three anubandhya cows viz. to Mitra and Varuna, to the Visve Devas and to Bphaspati,

but Āp. ( XIIL 23, 6. 10 and 14) rostriots them to Vājapeye, Rājasüya and sattras. Kāt. (X. 9. 14-15 ) says that instead of the cow, a bull may be offered or only payasyā may be offered to Mitra and Varuņa.8631 Ap. XIII. 24. 10 states that in place of the anubandhỹ& cow the followers of Rgveda offered amiksā to Mitra-Varupa and the offering was made by the hots in front of the havirdhana shed and all the ceremonies in the archetype işti up to Ida were performed in that rite. After the anubandhya (or amikşa) was offered came the five offerings called Devika viz. & cake on twelve potsherds to Dbāts and four oblations of rice cooked in milk in the four sthalis mentioned above (in which soma had been placed) to Anumati, Rāka, Sinivāli and Kuhū (Asv. VI. 14. 15, Ap. XIII. 24. 1-3). The yajamāna shaves his hair and moustache near the southern side of the vedi (Ap. XIII. 23. 16). The abovaniya fire is taken to the north outside the mahāvedi in an earthen-ware vessel and the kušas strewn on the vedi are burnt thereon and the smoke issuing therefrom is invoked with a mantra (Sat. IX. 6. p. 954), the adhvaryu offers on the fire (of the kubas) ground barley from his joined hands (Ap. XIII. 24. 16-17). The fires are then deposited in the arañis by repeating 'ayam te yonih'(Rg. III. 29.10, Tai. 8. 1. 5. 2, Vāj. S. III. 14 ) as stated in Āśv. III. 10. 5. Having given up the sacrificial ground he again produces fire by attrition to the north of the sacrificial ground and the udavasāniyā isti is performed. 2638 In this işti a cake baked on eight or five potsherds is offered to Agni (Ap. XIII. 25, 5, Sat. IX. 6. p. 956). In this işti (Ašv. VI. 14. 24) everything is done as in the punarādbeya, but the mantras are muttered inaudibly in all cases exoept the last anuyāja. A bull is the fee or as much gold as will purchase a bull. Instead of this işti an offering of ājya was inade by some ( Ap. XIII. 25, 7-8) from the jubũ in which twelve ladlings were made with sruva with idam vişnur' (Rg. I. 22. 17 ).

History of Dharmadāstra 

(Ch. XXXIII 

Ingenious theories have been advanced by European scholars about the origin of the soma sacrifices. Considera tions of space forbid the discussion of this topic here. Those who are interested in these speculations may consult Prof. Eggeling's Introduction to 8. B. E. vol. 26 pp. XI-XXIII (wbere several European works are cited and questions about Boma are discussed), L' Agnistoma (pp. 481-490), Prof. Keith's * Religion and philosophy of the Veda &o. pp. 331-332 and the works cited there. With the greatest respect for all these learned and industrious European savants it must be said that none of the theories has any great plausibility or carries con vlotion. The cult of the soma is at least Indo-Iranian and no sure traces are left in the ancient Indian religious books of the origin of that cult. We have simply the institution of the sacrifice before us and all else is imagination and speculation. One important question is the relation of the plant soma to the moon (also called some as in Rg. X. 85. 1 and 2). The moon is generally called 'man' or 'candramas' in the Rg. (Rg. V.51. 15, X. 85. 19, VIII. 94. 2, X. 12. 7, X. 68. 10). In Rg. VIII. 82. 8 occurs the very striking simile 4833 'Soma that is seen among the (soma) vessels as the moon in waters' and the Atharvaveda (XI. 6.7) states that the god whom people call Candramas is soma. In several places soma is addressed as indu (which certainly means the moon in later literature ). Vide Rg. IX. 86. 24, 26, 37, VIII. 48. 2, 4, 5, 12, 13. It is said that soma grew on Mūjavat (Rg. X. 34. 1) and in the Arjikiya country (Rg. VIII, 64, 11) on the river Susom.. Even in the Rgveda soma appears to have become mythical. In Rg. IX. 86.24 goma is said to have been brought from heaven by Suparna ( eagle or bird?) and in I. 93. 6 by a Syena (hawk). Another matter to be noted is that the soma plant had certainly become rare, 36% if not unobtainable, in the times of the Brāhmaṇas, The Sat. Br. IV. 5. 10 mentions several substitutes for soma, among which are Phalguna plants having brown flowers,

Düb plant and greenish kubas. The Tandya Br. says 'If one does not secure soma, one may extract juice from pātikas', 3645 *Jai. (III. 6. 40 and VI. 3. 13-17 ) states that this passage res tricts & sacrifioer when no soma is available to pūtikas and prevents the employment of other substances similar to soma and in VI. 3. 31 he declares that pūtikas are the proper prati nidhi ( substitute ) for soms and not any other substance even if it may be more similar to soma than pūtikas, but that if both pūtika and soma are unavailable then another substance similar to soma may be employed. Ašv. (VI. 8. 5-6) states that if soma stalks be not available thon pūtika stalks and Phalguna plant should be used or other plants mired with pūtikas may be employed (and the com. adds that those others are dārvā, kusa and the like). In the Deccan the plant that is taken to repre sent soma when soms sacrifices are rarely performed is called

GTKCHAPTER XXXIV OTHER SOMA SACRIFICES 

The sütras speak of seven forms ( samstbas ) of soma sacrifices. These seven forms are Agniştoma, Atyagnistoma, Ukthya, Sodasin, Vajapeya, Atirātra and Aptoryāma (according to Kat. X. 9. 27, Āāv. VI. 11. 1, Lat. V. 4. 24). The first of these has been described in some detail above. Owing to restrictions of space only a few words can be said about the other goma sacrifices. All sutras do not state the same number of soms sacrifices. Ap. XIV. 1.1 and Sat. IX.7. p. 958 expressly say that Ukthya, Sodasin, Atirātra and Aptoryāma are the modifications of Agnistoma and the commentaries of both point out that there were several views on the number of the modifica. tions of the Agniętoma. In the Brahmapas the Agniştoma, Ukthya, Sodasin and Atiratra are generally mentioned as formg of Jyotiştoma (vide Sat. Br. IV, 6. 3. 3, Tai. Br. I. 3.% and 4, which last mentions Vajapeya also ). 

Ukthya or Uktha. - In this there are three more stotras (called uktha stotras ) and sastras (called uktha sastras ) to be chanted and recited in the evening pressing, thus bringing the total of stotras and bastras to fifteen (Ait. Br. 14. 3, Asv. VI. 1. 1-3). Ap. XIV. 1. 2 says that the Ukthya, Şodasin, Atirātra and Aptoryāma are respectively performed by him who desires cattle, vigour, progeny and cattle, all objects. In the Ukthya an additional victim, & goat (over and above those offered in Agnistoma ) is sacrificed for Indra and Agni on the pressing day. Vide Ait. Br. XIV. 3, Ašv. VI. 1.1-3, Ap. XIV.1, Sat. IX. 7. pp. 958-959, Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 251 n, 8. B. E. vol, 41, pp. XIV-XVI. . 

Sodasin. In this sacrifice in addition to the fifteen stotras and fifteen sastras of the Ukthya there is an additional stotra and a corresponding sastra called Şodasin in the trtiya savana (both the sastra and the sacrifice have the same name, as the com, on Asv. VI. %. 1 days). There is an additional oup in the morning or at all pressings according to some ( Ap. XIV. 2. 4-5). It is made of khadira wood and is quadrangular in shape ( Sat. IX. 7. p. 960 ). The stotra for the sodatin oup is begun to be chanted

about sunset after the adhvaryu hands over a piece of gold to the sāma singer (instead of kusa grass, Ap. XIV, 3.1 ). Soma is purchased for a cow that is of very small stature and has red coloured ears. In this rite an additional victim viz. & ram is sacrificed for Indra. The fee is & reddish brown horse or a female mule. Vide Ait. Br. 16. 1-4, Ašv. VI, 2-3, Āp. XIV. 2. 3 ff, Sat. IX. 7. pp. 959–962, Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 255-256n, S.B.E. vol. 41 pp. XVI-XVII for further details. 

Atyagniştoma. This form is obtained by adding the şodasistotra, the şodasin cup and an additional victim for Indra to what prevails in the Agniętoma ; vide S. B. E, vol. 41, p. XVII. 

Atitātra. This soma sacrifice is referred to even in the Rgveda ( VII, 103.7). As this sacrifice is not finished in one day but only after the day and night pass away it is called Atirātra. Ap. X. 2. 4 notes that according to some the Atirātra is performed even before Agnistoma. The Atirātra has 29 stotras and 29 sastras. In this the additional stotras and sastras are repeated at night in four rounds (called paryayas ) of three stotras and sastras. Ašv. VI. 4. 10 points out these 12 sastras. In this sacrifice the sastra called Aśvina is recited, but before it six āhutis are offered at night. The Asvina-sastra closely follows the procedure of prataranuyaka, must comprise at least a thousand verses and was to be recited till sunrise (vide Haug': tr. of Ait. Br. pp. 268-269n for description of this sastra ). At twilight is chanted a stotra appropriately called Sandhistotrs (Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. pp. 266-267n). It is in the Rathantara melody. If the sun did not rise by that time the hotę was to continue reciting Rg. I. 112 and when the sun rose he was to recite gaurya hymns (viz. Rg. X. 158, I. 50. 1-9, I. 115, X. 37). A fourth animal viz. en ewe (or ram according to some ) is offered to Saras vati on the pressing day (Sat. IX. 7. p. 963 ). The principal camasaa in the night are offered to Indra Apidarvara ( Sat. IX. 7. p. 963.). A purodaja on two potsherds is offered by the pratiprasthāts to Afrins ( Āøv. VI. 5, 23 and Sat. IX. 7 p. 965) and a homs cup is offered to the Asvins. Jai. X. 8. 6 notes that as a vedic passage says there is no sodasin oup in Atiratra' and another says there is, the first is a prohibition and there is an option. For details vide Ait. Br. 14. 3 and 16.5-7, Akv. VI. 4-5, Sat. IX.7 pp. 662-665, Ap. XIV.3.8--XIV. 4. 11, S.B.E. vol. 41 pp. XVII-XX.

( Oh. XXXIV 

Aptoryāma-This sacrifice is similar to Atiratra of which it appears to be an amplification. Only there are four additional stotras (i. e. 33 in all) and four additional sastras recited by the hoty and his assistants, and there are four camasas in relation to these last respectively for Agni, Indra, Vißve Devas and Vişnu (Ap. XIV. 4. 12-16, Sat. IX. 7 pp. 966-967, San. XV. 5. 14-18 and Sat. X. 8. p. 1111). Accord ing to Ašv. (IX. 11. 1) he whose cattle do not live or who desires to secure cattle of good breed should perform the Aptoryāma. Ašv. (IX. 9. 22-23 ) says that in this the fee is more than a thousand (cows) up to an unlimited number and the hotę gets a special gift of a white chariot (plated with silver) to which female mules are yoked. This sacrifice is generally joined with others. The Tāņdya Br. ( XX. 3. 4-5) states that the rite is so called because by its performance one seoures whatever object one desires ( from 'ap' to obtain ). 

Vajapeya-(lit, food and drink, or drink of strength or of food or of a race ).8038 Though this rite is said to be a form of Jyotiştoma and though it follows the procedure of Sodasin (Ap. XVIII. 1. 4) it has so many special features of its own that it may be said to be an independent sacrifice. One chara cteristio feature is that the number 17 is predominant in this sacrifice ( Ap. XVIII. 1.5, Tāpdya XVIII. 7.5), viz. there are 17 stotras and 17 sastras, the 17th being the Vājapeya stotra and sastra, 17 animals sacrificed for Prajapati, 17 objeots distributed as fee, the yüpa ( of bilva or khadira wood) was 17 aratnis in length, at the time of enveloping the yüpa with a girdle in this rite 17 pieces of cloth were employed for the purpose ( Āp. XVIII. 1. 12 ), it lasted for 17 days (for 13 days dikşa, 3 upasad days and one pressing day) or there were 17 dikşas (and then the rite lasted for 21 days). Vide Ašv. IX, 9. 2-3 and Ap. XVIII. 1. 6-7. Another feature was that there were seventeen oups of surā ( wine) for Prajapati as well as 17 cups of soma. Another peculiarity was that there were seventeen chariots to which horses were yoked and a race was run, when seventeen drums that were arranged on the northern śroni of the vedi were simultaneously beaten ( Ap. XVIII. 4. 4 and 7, Kat. XIV, 3. 14 ) to the west of the āgnidhra shed,

This complicated rite was undertaken by one who desired overlordship (adhipatya, as Ašv. IX. 9. 1 says) or prosperity (Ap. XVIII. 1.1) or svārājya ( the position of Indra or uncontrolled dominion). It was performed in the autumn.8887 Only a brā. hmaņa or a kşatriya could perform it, but not a vaiśya 2638 (Kāt. XIV. 1. 1 and Ap. XVIII. 1. 1). In the case of a brāhmaṇa the reward aimed at must have been the attainment of the position of a super-eminently learned or prosperous man. All the priests, the sacrificer and his wife wear chains of gold, and Asv. IX. 9. 5 adds that the chain worn by the hotr has a hundred lotus like pendants studded with precious stones. The golden chain worn by each priest becomes part of his fee. Besides the three viz. for Agni, Indra and Agni and for Indra (a ram), & barren cow for Maruts and ewe for Sarasvati and 17 hornless, young and virile goats of one colour (or all of dark colour) for Prajāpati are offered in this rite ( Āp. XVIII. 2. 12-13, Kat: XIV. %. 11-13). For the 17 cups of wine (called parisrut, prepared from several herbs ) the pratiprasthātr prepares & separate mound ( khara ) to the west of the axle of the southern havirdhāng cart on which the wine cups made of clay are to be kept. The soma cups are to the east of the axle of the cart and wine cups to the west and they are to be kept separate. According to Kāt. ( XIV. 1. 17 and 26) it is the nestr priest that gets ready the mound and the wine cups. In the midst of the wine cups a golden cup of honey is placed (Tai. Br. I. 3.3, Kāt. XIV. 2. 9). The wine is purchased ready-made in exchange for lead from a long-haired man at the time when soma stalks are purchased, or the material, for making wine is bought, and is entered into the sacrificial enolosure by the southern door and is boiled on the dakşiņa fire (Kāt. XIV. 1. 14-17). The yüpa has four angles (and not sight as elsewhere ) and has no top protruding beyond the oaşāla, but its top is even and is slightly depressed in the middle. The caşāla of the yūpa ( which is 17 aratnis high ) is made of wheat flour ( Tai. Br. I. 3, 7, Ap. XVIII. 1. 8, Kat. XIV. 1. 22). A race is run in connection with the mid-day pressing in the

History of Dharmadāstra (Ch. XXXIV following way (Ap. XVIII. 3. 3 and 12-13). The Tai. Br. I. 3. % refers to the race won by Bfhaspati and connects the Vājapeya with that race. Seventeen chariots are got ready to the east of the dhavaniya with their yokes to the north or east. One of them is the sacrificer's chariot to which three horses are yoked with mantras and a fourth runs along the third but is not yoked. These horses are made to smell the caru of wild rice ( nivāra ) which is meant for Bșhaspati. To the sixteen other chariots four horses each are yoked outside the vedi but without mantras (com. on Kat. XIV, 3, 11). A ksatriya ( rāja putra according to Ap.) shoots an arrow from the space between the cātvāla and utkara and notes the spot where it falls, from which he shoots an arrow a second time. This is done seventeen times. On the spot where the arrow falls at the 17th shooting, he plants a post of udumbara wood as the goal for the chariot race ( Āp. XVIII. 3. 12 and Kat. XIV. 3. 1-11 and 16-17). When the race starts, the brahmā priest fixes an udumbara ohariot-wheel (having seventeen spokes according to Kāt. V. 12. 11 ) on an axle (or udumbara post navel-high ) implanted on a spot between the cātvāla and the utkara (or near the utkara ) and ascends on that wheel with at the impulse of God Savitr may I win vāja (vigour, food or race) with the help of Bphaspati, the winner of vāja' (Ap. XVIII. 4. 8, Kāt, XIV. 3. 12 which mentions Vaj. S. IX. 10). When the wheel is revolved from left to right ( it is revolved thrice) the brahma chants the Vāji-saman 2688 (Ap. XVIII. 4. 11, Āøv. IX. 9. 8. Lāț. V. 12. 14). According to Lāt. ( V. 12. 13 ) the brahmā only rests his arms on the wheel. The yajamāna ocoupies the chariot on which mantras were recited and the adhvaryu ( or his pupil ) also gets into it to instruct the yajamāna to repeat the Vedic formulao he has to utter. Other persons (called vājasșt) join in the race and sit in the other sixteen chariots and a ksatriya or vaisya site in one of them and the race starts with speed. All the seventeen drums are beaten on the northern sropi of the vedi to urge on the horses. All the horses are made to smell the caru of wild rice ( nIvāra ) cooked in 17 pots for Bphaspati. The chariot of the sacrificer is in front and the others follow his, but do not overtake it. The adhvaryu makes the yajamina

recite the formulae of victory such as ' agnirekakşarena' (Vāj. S. VIII. 31-34, Tai. S. I. 1. 11 ). When the chariot reaches the goal, the chariot is taken to its north and then turned round to the south. All the chariots return to the sacrificial ground and the horses are again made to smell the caru of nivāras and a homa is offered for dischar ging the drums ( dundubhi-vimocanlya-homa ). A berry ( krsnala, gold of that weight) is given to each of those that rode the chariots, but that gold is taken back from them and is donated to the brahmā who also receives the golden jar of honey (Kat, XIV. 4. 17, Āp. XVIII. 5. 5 ) after it is presented to and taken back from the kşatriya or valby. The oups of Boma are taken up by the priests (the adhvaryu taking the hotr-camasa), and the camasā āhvaryus take up their cups ; while the pratiprasthātr takes up the principal wine cup and the other sixteen are taken up by those who joined in the race. The adhvaryu starts towards the east with the soma cups with * sam prcaḥ' (Tai. Br. I. 3. 3 ), the pratiprasthātr to the west with the wine cups and stands near the mārjallya shed. After the adhvaryu offers the soma cups, the wine cups are shaken and given to the sixteen persons who took part in the race and they quaff them on the southern groni of the vedi. According to Kāt. (XIV. 3. 20 and XIV. 4, 16) the ksatriya or vaisya who sat in one of the chariots receives all the wine cups. When preparations are made to chant the Mahendra stotra, the nestr requests the wife to put on short undergarment of darbha and the yajamāna wears a silken garment (tārpyam ) 2040 inside the garment which he wears as a dikşita. A ladder is raised against the yüpa to its north or south (Kāt. XIV, 5, 5) and when the sacrificer climbs to the top of the yüpa a dialogue ensues between the sacrificer and his wife (Kat. XIV. 5. 6-11, Āp. XVIII. 5. 9-11). The sacrificer addresses 'wife, come, let us ascend to heaven'. The wife responds 'let us ascend'. They engage in this dialogue thrice. According to Kāt. XIV. 5.8 both husband and wife climb to the top of the yüpa, while accor ding to Ap. (XVIII. 4. 12) only the husband does so who finally says 'out of us both I shall ascend to heaven'. On reaching the top he touches the oaşāla of wheat flour and mutters' we reached the heaven, the gods' (Tai. S. I. 7.9. 2, Vāj. S. IX. 21). Thence he looks at his house with May I live long with my children'

(Tai. S. I. 7. 9, 2) or in the several directions with Vāj. 8. IX. 22 ( Kāt. XIV. 5. 11). Vaisyas (explained as his children by the com. on Kat. XIV. 5. 12 ) throw up to him 17 bags of Balt or saltish earth enveloped in leaves of asvattha or (acoord ing to Ap. XVIII. 5. 16-18) the adhavaryu, brahmā, hots and udgats raise up the bags to his face on long poles respectively from the east, south, west and north with mantras (referring to food, vāja and winning of vāja) Ho receives them and descende. He plants his right foot on a piece of gold placed over a goat-skin spread in front of the yüpa on the ground with its neok to the east and hairy side outside and his left foot on the skin itself and from thence he sits down on a couch placed on the west side of the uttaravedi. The offerings of the omentum and other limbs of the animal for Sarasvati and of other animals are made, the wild rios caru for Bphaspati is offered and the priests partake of the remnants as usual. The animals for Prajāpati are offered at the time of the mid-day pressing. Before the offering to Sviştakýt of the wild rice caru is made water and milk are poured in a vessel of udumbara and food of seventeen kinds of grains or of as many as the sacrificer remembers except one is also put therein and seven offerings are made of all this with the sruva and the yajamāna is sprinkled with the rest (Kat. XIV. 5. 20-24). He does not eat throughout his life-time the food of the one kind of grain that was omitted. The adhvaryu declares thrice after taking the name of the sacrificer 'he, so and so, is samrat' (overlord). Ap. XVIII. 7. 18 says that on performing vājapeya & man is entitled to use the white parasol. After the performance of Vājapeya the sacrificer had to observe certain rules of conduct (vide LỄt. VIII, 12, 1-4, Ap. XVIII. 7. 16-17). He should act like a kşatriya (i. e. he may study and make gifts, but should not teach or accept gifts ), he should not rise to receive or do abbivādana or carry \#1 errands for or sit on the game couch with a person who had not performed that sacrifice. The adhvaryu receives the horses and the chariot in which the sacrificer sat (Ap. XVIIL 3. 10) and receives also all the 17 olothes with which the yüpa was enveloped. As to other fees there is some divergence among Ap. XVIII. 3. 4-5, Ašv. IX. 9, 14-17, Kat. XIV. 2. 29-33 and Lāţ. VIII. 11. 16-2%. Aby, says that 1700 cows, 17 chariots to which horses are yoked, seventeen

horgos, seventeen animals which men ride, seventeen draught oxen, seventeen carts, 17 slave-girls decked with golden nişkas round their necks, 17 elephants with golden girt bs-these consti. tute the fee in Vājapeya and Ašv. suggests other alternatives. Ap. XVIII. 3. 4 is almost the same but adds seventeen goats and ewes. Lat (VIII. 11. 16-18) is also practically the same as Aøy. but adds several alternatives about cows. In the Kuruva japeya ( variously explained in the com.) cows donated are only 17, in other Vājapeyas 1700 or 17000 cows may be given. Lat. further says that the gifts may be equally divided among all the priests, that the chariot ocoupied by the sacrificor over which yajus mantras were recited and the couob with its coverlet are given to the udgātę, the goat-skin with the golden piece is taken by the hots. 

It will have been noticed that this sacrifice has several picturesque elements in it. In the race and the drinking bout of seventeen cups there is a popular element. In the climbing to the top of the yüpa by the sacrificer and in the boiled wild rice for Bphaspati there is & symbolism of holiness and eminence. 

Asv. IX. 9. 19 says that after performing Vājapeya a king should perform Rajasūya and & brābmana should perform Bphaspatieava, 3648 while Āp. XVIII, 7. 15 recommends the Sautrāmaņi after it. Kat. ( XIV. 1.2-8) states various views. 

Jaimini in several adhikaranas deals with the fruti texts about V&japeya. They may be briefly indicated here. In I. 4. 6-8 he shows that in the sentence one desiring to seoure overlordship should sacrifice with Vājapoya' the word Vājapeya is the name of & rite (karmanāmadheya) and that that sentence does not lay down some subordinate matter ( such as what material is to be used ) in the model sacrifice and that the word vājapeya does not mean gruel or similar substance. In Jai, III. 1. 18 it is said that the taxt of the Vājapeya the yüpa is 17 aratnis' 

2642. According to Jai. IV. 3. 29-31 tbo Bộbas patisuva is an anga of Vajapeya and the sentence वाजपेयेनेष्ट्रा वृहस्पतिसपेन यजेत does not lay down a tine for the performance of that rite. Vide Tai. Br. 11. 7. 1 and Āp. XXII. 7.5 ff, Adv. IX. 5. 3 ff for TOPTFT wbich is a kind of Ekāba soma sacrifico and which is to be performed by one who desires overlordabip (adbipatys ) or spiritual ominence (brahma varCasa ) according to Ādv. IX. 5. 3 or by one who desires to be the purohita of a king (Tai. Br. II. 7. 1). 

1212 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Ch. XXXIV 

means that the yüpa required for the sacrifice of animals in the Vājapeya is to be 17 aratnis high and not that any other thing like the Sodasipatra was to be 17 aratnis. When the Tại. Br. ( I. 3, 4 ) says that seventeen animals are to be killed for Prajapati, they are 17 separate yāgas and not one rite ( karma). When it is said that caru is prepared in milk in seventeen sarāvas ( pots), the method of taking out handfuls of grains ( as in darśapürnamāsa ) is not applicable. Jai, says (in XI. 4. 30 ) that the vessel ( kumbhi), the śūla and the spit for roasting the omentum are the same for all the viotims, that the omentum of the victim for Prajāpati is not sprinkled with the ājya remaining after the prayāja offerings are made ( IV.1. 33-39) and that the chariot which was ocoupied by the sacrificer is to be specially given to adhvaryu and not any one of the seventeen chariots i.e. there is a restrictive rule about the share in chariots for the adhvaryu, while there is none as to the other priests ( X. 3. 74-75 ). 2018 

The Agnistoma and the other forms of some sacrifices so far described are ekāha ( one day ) soma sacrifices i. e. in them soma is offered in cups on one day thrice (in the morning, mid day and evening ). The sūtras (e. g. Aøv. IX. 5-11, Baud. XVIII, 1-10, Kāt. XXII), however, mention and describe several other one day soma sacrifices, such as Bịhaspatioava, Gosava, Syena, Udbhid, Visvajit, Vrātyastoma (already dese cribed above on pp. 345-347) which are left out for want of space. 8644

2644. The Visvajit from among the okūbas is a very striking saori foo. In this the sacrificer either gives a thousand cows or all wealth after separating the share of the eldest son (and excepting land and Sudras who serve him as a duty). Jai, sets out several propositions about this sacrifice in IV. 3. 10-16, VI. 7. 1-20, VII, 3., 6-11, X. 6. 13. After this rite, the sacrificer stays three days at the root of an uduin bara tree subsisting on fruits and roots, for three days in a sottlement of pisadas ( where ho may subsist on nivaras i. e, on rice, dyauaka and the filesb of deer ), for tbree days among vaidyas (jana, also explained as porsons of another gotra ':) and three days with kpatriya :(savānajana,

Ahina sacrifices 

1213 

The abina sacrifices 8045 are those the duration of wbich is two to twelve days of soma pressing, which always end with an atirātra and wbich together with the dikgā and upasad days should not extend beyond a month. They should be begun on & Full Moon day. Among them there are groups of sacri. fices that last for two days, three days (e. 8. Gargatrirātra ), four days, five days (called pañoarātras of which Pañcağāra diya is one ), sadabas and so on. Among the numerous rites called ahinas, the Asramedha and Dyādasāha deserve notice. The Aśvamedha will be described later on. The Dvādaśāha is both an ahina and a sattra ( Aśy. X. 5. 2). There are several varteties of Drādaśaba, one being called Bharata-dvādasāhs (Aby. X. 5. 8., Ap. XXI. 14. 5). The twelve days of the Dvā. dasāha 88 & sattra are constituted by the Prāganiya ( the com mencing rite, an Atiratra ), Prsthya Şadaba 2646 ( 6 days), Chan domas whioh are Ukthyas (3 days) and a tenth day which is 

( Continued from last page) also expalined as sagotras ). For it yoar ho should aot refuse what is offered but should not beg. Vide Kat, XXII. 1. 9-33, Lāt. VIII.2. 1-13. Tbo Gosava is a very strange rite. Tho Tai. Br. II. 7.6 briefly describes it. One who desires ovārajya may perform it and Ap. ( XXII. 12. 12-20 and XXII. 13. 1-3) states that for a year thereafter he should be pasuvrata (act like cattle ) i, n. should drink water like them and cut grass (with his teeth ) anil approach his mother &c. (probably only as & make-believe ). TOT HTAR Tan Tai gergruiainfo meso FUTC 1 JT ATATLATTEO FRE 2 1314. XXII. 13. 1-3. Another very striking ekabe sacrifice is the FETT. This is porformed by one who desires to die ou perforining it and to obtain heaven. When tho Arbhava pavam na stotra is begun to be chanted in the third prossing, the sacrifioer directs the prieste to finish the sacrifice and enters fire. This sacrifice is called Thirtai. Vide

History of Dharmaśāstra (Ch. XXXIV 

an Atyagnistoma (called Avivākya, on which no speaking or dispute about errors is allowed) and the Udayaniya (conr cluding rite, which again is an Atiratra ). The principal differences between the Dvādaśaba as an abins and a sattra are: (1) & sattra can be performed only by bribmapas, while a dvādasāba may be performed by any one of the first three varpas ; (2) the sattra may extend over even long periods ( such 28 a year or more ), while a dvadasaha cannot so extend ; (3) in the sattra the distinction of yajamāns and priests does not exist but all are yajamānas and all work as priests, while in dvadasaba that distinction exists ;(4) ( as a consequence of the above) in & sattra there are no dakşiņās. Kat. XII. 1. 4 states that wherever in the vedio texts the words 'upayanti'and' Agate' ocour it is a sign of a 'sattra' (and so in that case the rules about sattras will apply ) but where the word 'yajate' or 'yājayet' is used it is a sign of an ahina. In an abins only the last day is an Atiratra, but in a sattra both the first and last days are Atirātras (Kat. XII. 1. 6). 

It is now necessary to say something about a few other striking sacrifices. 

Rājasūya.—This is strictly not a purely soma sacrifice, but it is a most complex ceremony extending over a very long period (more than two years) and comprising a number of separate iştis (like the one to Anumati), Soma sacrifices (like Pavitra) and animal sacrifices (Kāt. XV. 1. 3). Even the briefest statement of the several rites will ocoupy many pages. An attempt will be made to indicate only a few salient features. 

This ceremony could be performed only 2647 by a ksatriya. There was a difference of view, some holding that it could be performed only by him who had not celebrated the Vājapeya (Kāt. XV, 1.2), while others held that it should be celebrated after Vājapoya (Asv. IX. 9. 19). In the Sat. Br. IX, 3, 4.8 it is said 'by performing the Rajasaya one becomes a king ( rājan )

and by the Vājapoya an emperor ( samrāt) and the position of the king is (obtained) first and thereafter of emperor.' On the first day of the bright half of Phalgune the sacrificer under goes diksa for a soma sacrifice called Pavitra, which follows the procedure of Agnistoma (Lāt, IX. 1, 2, Asv. IX. 3. 2, Kāt. XV, 1. 6). There was difference of opinion as to the number of dikşā days (Lat. IX. 1. 8, Kat. XV. 1. 4). The Abbişecaniya ceremony which is the principal among the rites of Rāja sūya took place exactly a year after the Pavitra sacrifice was commenced (Lat. IX. 1. 4). At the end of the Abhişecaniya the sacrificer did not actually enter into water for the final bath (avabhrtha ), but wearing shoes made of boar-skin be repaired from the sacrificial ground (devayajana ) to the water, put into the water black antelope horn or the foot portion of & black antelope skin and returned wearing shoes of black antelope skin (Lat. IX. 1. 23-24), 

There are five offerings oommencing the next day after the Pavitra sacrifice, one each on one day. Then on the Full Moon of Phālguna there is an işti to Anumati (& purodass being offered ). Vide Kat. XV. 1.9 and Āp. XVIII. 8. 10. There is an offering to NirȚti prepared from the particles of grains that fall to the west of the samyā from the mill-stone when the grains for the purodaga to Anumati are being ground. The particles are taken in the sruya and a firebrand being lighted from the dakşiņa fire, the offering is made to the south of the vihāra on that fire-brand or on some baltish land. On the full moon day of Phālguna are begun the citurmāsyas (1. e. first the Vaišvadeva, then after four months Varuņapraghāsas and so on). This goes on for one year. Between the parvans of the cāturmāsyas, the monthly full moon and new moon sacrifices are performed. The cāturmāsyas come to an end with the Sunāsiriya parva on the first of the bright half of Phālguna. After that several rites follow such as the Pañosvātiya in five fires in the four directions and in the middle (Ap. XVIII. 9. 10-11, Kat. XV. 1. 20-21 ), the Apāmārga-homa ( Ap. XVIII. 9. 15-20, Kāt. XV. 2. 1 ff.). Then there are twelve offerings called 'ratninām 2648 bavimşi' performed on twelve days one 

2648. The ratpius' are onumerated somewhat differently in different texts, though some are common to all. Vide Tai, S. I. 8. 9. 1-2,

after another in the houses of the ratnas' (jewels ) viz. of the sacrificer himself, his queens and state functionaries (Kāt. XV. 8 and Āp. XVIII. 10). The deity to whom an offering is made is appropriate to the person in whose house the offering is made and the offerings and fees algo differ. The twelve persons ( according to Kāt.) are the sacrificer, the commander of the army, the purohita, the crowned queen, the sata (minstrel ?), grāmani ( village headman), the kşatt; ( chamberlain), samgra hits ( treasurer or charioteer?), aksā vāpa ( superintendent of gambling), govikarta (hunter?), dūta or pālagala ( courier), parivýkti (the discarded queen) and the deities respectively are Indra, Agni Anikavat, Bphaspati, Aditi, Varuna, Maruts, Savits, Asvins, Rudra (for both aksāvāpa and govikarta ), Agni, Nirsti ( the offering in this case is a caru of black rice husked with the nails). The dakşiņās also vary ( vido Āp. XVIII. 10. 15-30, Kāt. XV. 3. 16-34). Then follow several offeringe. Then comes the Abhişecaniya rite which is the central ceremony in Rājasüya and which lasts for five days ( one day dikşā, three days upasads and one sutyā day of some pressings). The dikşā of Abhişecaniya (anointing rite ) is performed on the first of Caitra. It is performed on the southern part of the sacrificial ground while the Dasapeya is performed on the northern portion. In the Abhişecaniya and Daśapeya the hots must be of the Burgugotra (Tandya Br. XVIII. 9. 2, Kāt. XV. 4.1, Śān. XV.13.2). The Abbişecanlya follows the procedure of the Ukthya. Soma is bought for both Abhişecanlya and Dagapeya at the same time, but half of it (for Dasapoya) is deposited, after being carried in a cart, in the house of the brahmā priest. Then there are eight offerings of caru called Devasü-havinşi viz. to Savitr, Agni Gșhapati, Soma Vanaspati, Brhaspati, Indra, Rudra, Mitra, Varuņa. According to Ap. XVIII. 12. 7-8 after these eight offer. ings the brahmā priest announces to the 'ratnins' that the sacrificer is their king and refers to the tribes or people occupying the country.2646 Vide Kāt. XV. 4. 15-17 also. At the end of idā in the case of these caru offerings the priest brings waters of seventeen kinds in seventeen vessels of udumbara wood, viz. of the Sarasvati river, flowing water of a river, water from ripples produced by the entrance of a man or animal, water

(Kāt. XV. 4. 21-42, Ap. XVIII 13. 1-18). All the waters are poured into a vat of udumbara which is placed near the seat of Maitrāvarupa. After the Marutvatly& cup is offered in the Ukthya rite, he spreads to the east of the vessel of water a tiger skin on the western end of which lead is placed. Six homas called Pārtha660 are offered (Ap. XVIII. 15. 8, Kat. XV. 5. 34 ) and then with a gold piece tied in two kusa blades the water in the big vessel is cleansed (that is utpavana is performed) and is distributed in four Vessels made of palaša, udumbara, nyagrodha and asvattha. The sacrificer wears a silken garment ( tarpya, explained by Kāt. XV, 5.7-11 ), a white turban ( one end of which hangs from the shoulder ) and a mantle. The sacrificer recites the Avid formula 2651 (Ap. XVIII. 14. 10, Kat. XV. 5. 21, which refers to Vaj. S. X. 9). The adhvaryu gives a strung bow and three arrows to the sacrificer, who puts & copper piece in the mouth of a long haired man ( eunuch ) for averting evil (from spirits and snakes ? ); vide Vāj. S. X. 10. The sacrificer treads upon the piece of lead and brushes it away with his foot and stands on the tiger-skin with a gold piece under his foot and has a fillet of gold on his head. The sacrificer holds up his arms. He strides in the quarters. The sacrificer stands facing the east and the adhvaryu, standing in front of him, first sprinkles him with the holy water contained in the vessel of palasa, the other priests follow viz. the brahmā sprinkles him from the right with water in udumbara vessel and so on. Besides, the king's brother ( Kāt. XV. 5.30) or another ksatriya (Ap. XVIII. 16. 3) sprinkles him with water from the udumbara vessel, a friendly ksatriya from the third vessel and a vaibya from the fourth (Ap. XVIII. 16. 3-5 days a kşatriya sprinkles water from udumbara vessel, a vaisya sprinkles from behind the king with water from asvattha vessel and a friend from the common people sprinkles from the north side with water in the nyagrodha

Vessel). These actions are probably symbolic of the consent of all people to the anointing. The sacrificer rubs with the antelope horn over the whole of his body the holy water sprinkled over him ( Kat. XV. 6.8). According to Kat. XV. 6. 1-2 at this stage or after the dice play ( to be described later) the hotr priest sitting on a cushion inlaid with gold reoites the story of Sunahgepa858 for the sacrificer's benefit. Ap. XVIII. 19. 10 places this recital after the dice-play, Aøv, IX. 3. 9 gays that the story of Sunahsepa is recited to the anointed king after the marutvatiya sastra in the Abhişecaniya rito (and before the Nişkevalya sastra ), the king being seated on a golden cushion and surrounded by his son and ministers. The adhvaryu also sits on a cushion inlaid with gold and utters the responses (pratigara) uttering 'om (as the pratigara) at the end of each fk and' tathā' at the end of eaob gātha. 2858 At the end of the recitation the sacrificer donates a hundred or a thousand cows to the hotr and to the adhvaryu and donates also their respective cushions. The king takes three strides called Vişnukrama on the tiger-bide. All the remnants of the anointing waters are poured in the palāsa vessel and are handed over by the anointed king to his son with the words 'May my Bon continue this my work and this my prowess.' Then two homas are offered (called nāmavyatişañjaniya ) in which at first the son is declared to be the father of his father and then secondly the relationship is rightly put.2856 Vide A.p. XVIII, 16. 14-15, Kāt. XV. 6.11. Then there is a symbolic maroh for the plunder of cows. As in Vajapeya & chariot is made ready, four horses are yoked to it, the sacrificer ascends it, takes the chariot in the midst of a group of hundred or more cows belonging to his kinsmen collected to the north of the Abavaniya,

touches one of them with the string of his bow and says ' I seize these.' Then he restores to the owner as many cows as are collected or more and returns to the sacrificial ground and makes four offerings called Rathavimocaniya. Vide Kat. XV. 6. 13-23. Lāț. (IX. 1. 14-22) gives & more graphic acoount that at the time of giving gifts, the king's kinsmen are collected with their wealth, arrows are discharged at them by the sacrifoer, they themselves bring back the arrows and deolare "O king, may you be victorious.' One-third of their wealth is distributed among the priests, one-third is given at the time of the Dašapeya to the worthy brahmaņas brought in that rite, one-third is returned to the kinsmen, villages are bestowed on them and they become rājanyas ( king's nobles) but not worthy of coronation. Before getting down from the chariot he puts on boar-skin shoes, bows to the earth with 'O mother earth! do not injure me nor may I injure thee' (Vaj. 8. X. 23, Tai. S. 1. 8. 15. 1). The king tben sits on a chair or throne made of khadira that is placed in front of the āgnidhriya shed (Ap. XVIII. 18. 5-8, Kāt. XV. 7.1-4). The priests and the 'ratnins' take seats round him; the brahmā priest ( the purohits or adbvaryu according to Kāt. XV. 7. 11 ) hands over the sphys to the king, from whom it passes on to several persons viz. the king's brother, sāta, sthapati, village headman, kingman ( Āp. XVIII. 18. 14-16). According to Kat. ( XV. 7. 13 ) the kinsmen and the pratiprasthātr mark out a place for dice play with the sphya ( according to Ap. XVIII. 18. 16 the superintendent of gambling does so). On the ground so marked a quadrangular hut or shed is erected. Five dice are handed over to the king who is lightly struck by the priests with sticks of sacrificial trees. The king calls as umpires ( upadrastr) the samgrabits, the bhāgadugba ( collector of taxes ) and the kşattř ( Ap. XVIII. 19. 6-8). The play is so arranged that the best throw ( of the dice) comes to the king and the worst to his kiasman.865€ It appears that the dice play required golden pieces also beyond a hundred or a thousand in number (Ap. XVIII. 19. 1). According to Kat. ( XV. 7. 25–26 ) the king actually undergoes the avabhitha bath, wbile Latyayana as stated above differs.

and barley and baked on twelve potsherds is offered to Indra and Vişnu. For ten days after the Abbişecanly& he offers successively on each day offerings called 'saṁsrpām havimşi' respectively to Savitr, Sarasvati, Tvaştr, Pūşan, Indra, Bșhas pati, Varuna, Agni, Soma, Vişņu ( Kāt, XV. 8. 1-4, Ap. XVIII. 20. 7 which says they are ten or seven and they begin with Agni; Aşv. IX. 4. 6 speaks of only seven). Each of these is offered in fire set up in a devayajana to the east of the prece ding one and the last of the ten is offered in the shed prepared for the Dašapeya rito ( Āp. XVIII. 20. 8-10, Kat. XV. 8, 2-3). On each of the ten (or seven) iştis ( of samspāın havímşi) he offers to the priests ordinary or golden lotus flowers and on the tenth day he wears & garland made of those flowers. That becomes his consecration (dikşa) for the next rite, viz. Daśapeye. Jaimini declares (in XI. 2,57-62) that though som& is purchas ed for both Abhişecaniya and Dadapeya at the same time ( vide p. 1216 above), yet in the two ekāhas the whole procedure of soma sacrifices is repeated. A different proposition is stated in Kāt. XV, 8, 10-13 (except as to dikşā and avabbộtha which are repeated in both rites). On the tenth day after the Abhişecanlya is finished the Dašapeya is performed (Lāţ. IX, 2.1, Kāt. XV. 8. 14 says on the 7th day i. e. on 7th of the bright half of Caitra ). This rite is so called because in it each of the ten camasas ( cups ) of soma aro partaken of by ten brāhmaṇas ( Ašv. IX, 3. 18, Ap. XVIII. 21.3). The brāhmaṇas are the ten štviks who ordinarily partake of the soma in camasas plus 90 more (called anuprasarpakas ) who poseels special qualifications, viz. whose ten ancestors on the father's and mother's sides were masters of Vedic lore, had rigorously performed their duties and were engaged in holy sotions and who had no sexual or marital alliances with non-brāhmaņas2858 ( vide Aśv.

Fees are presoribed at many of the constituent rites in Rajasūya, but special fees are mentioned in connection with the Abbişecaniya and Dašapeya (Asv. IX. 4. 2 ff). At the Abhişecanfya Aøv. recommends 32000 cows to each of the four principal priesta, 16000 to each of the first assistants of the four, 8000 to each of the next four, 4000 to each of the last group of four ( Ašv. IX. 4, 3-5). These come to the huge figure of 240000 cows. Vide Sān, XV. 16. 16-19 also for such large figures. At the Dasapoya 1000 cows are the fee and then there are special rewards for the 16 priests ( Ašv. IX. 4. 7-20, Ap. XVIII. 21. 6-7, Kāt. XV. 8. 23–27, Lat. IX. %. 9-15) viz. a golden chain, a horse, a miloh cow ( with calf ), a goat, two golden ear-rings, two silver ear-rings, twelve five year old pregnant cows, a barren cow, & round golden ornament (rukma). a bull, cotton cloth, a thick hempen piece of cloth, & cart full of barley drawn by an ox, an ox, a heifer, a young three year old bull respectively to udgātr, his three assistants, adhvaryu, pratiprasthātr, brahmā, maitrāvaruņa, hots, brāhmaṇācohamsin, potę, nestr, acchāvāka, agoidbra, unnet; and grövastut. 

For one year after the avabhrtha bath in Dasapeya, the king has to keep certain observances (called deva vratas in Lāt. IX. 2. 17 ff) viz. he should not plunge in water for daily bath but should only rub his body with water, should always brush his teeth, pare bis nails, should not cut his hair (but may shave the mustache or beard ), should sleep in the sacrificial fire-shed on a tiger-skin with its hair upwards, should daily offer fuel. sticks; his subjects (except brāhmapas ) should not out their hair for 8 year, nor should horses' bair be cut for a year. For a year he should never walk on the ground unless he wears shoes ( Kat. XV. 8. 29 ). 

There are several minor offerings, such as those called pancabila in four quarters and in the midst ( Kat. XV. 9. 1-3), twelve prayuj offerings at the interval of a month or on two days (Kat. XV. 9. 11-14, Ap. XVIII. 22,5-7). 

At the end of a year from the Dasapeya took place the rite called Kebavapanlya*65* which followed the procedure of the

Atiratra sacrifice (Ašv. IX. 3. 24 ) and in which hair grown for a year were cut off. About the exact time of the rite therg were different views. The com, on Ašv. says it was performed on some day in the bright half of Valbākha, while the com. on Kat. XV. 9. 20 says that the pressing day of Kebavapaniya fell on the Full moon day of Jyestha. Vide also Lat. IX, 3. 1-3. Then follow two rites called Vyuşti-dviratra (dvirātra for prosperity ), which were respectively (first) an Agnistoma and (the 2nd) an Atirātra performed at the interval of one month (Kat. XV. 9. 21-23, Ašv. IX. 3. 25-26). There were several views about the time of their performance (Lat. IX. 3. 5-9, Ap. XVIII. 22. 14-16). Then one month after the 2nd Vyustidvi. rātra ( i. e. on Srāvana Full Moon day ) was performed the rite called Kşatradhști (lit. stability of martial power) which followed the procedure of Agniştoma (Ašv. IX. 3.27, Lat, IX. 3. 13). San. ( XV.16. 10-11 ) refers to the legend that Kurus lost in each battle because they did not offer the Kşatra-dhfti rite. *** According to Sat. Br. V. 5. 5. 6-9 in place of the Udayaganiy: there was the Traidhatavi isti in wbich a cake prepared of barley and rice mixed together was offered. This finished the Rajagüya, but one month after it in the bright half the Sautr.. mani işti wag performed. This last is dealt with separately below. 

It will have been seen that this complex rite is full of symbolio elements and also popular elements like dice-play. 

In the sabhāparve of the Mahabharata (chap. 33-35 ) there is a description of the Rajasūya performed by Yudhişthira, but it is of the vaguest sort and does not go into any details. Vide Jai. IV. 4. 1-4 (the dioe-play has no independent fruit and that it, though held for the cow referred to in Ap. XVIII. 19.%, is not an anga of the abbişecaniya only, but really of the whole Rajasdya ), V. 2. 13-15 (in the offerings called Devasūhayımşi, wbioh are prepared from several kinds of oorn, the mortar is one for pounding all the corns one after another ), XI. 4. 1-3, XI. 4. 4- (the priests chosen at the beginning should continue to work till the end ), XI. 4. 8-10 ( about the offerings in the houses of the ratnins'), XI. 4. 43 (the mantra

SAUTRAMANĪ2660 AND OTHER SACRIFICES 

This rite is included among the seven forms of bavir. yajñas (Gaut. VIII. 20, Lat. V. 4. 23). It is not a soma saorifice but is a combination of an işçi with animal sacrifice (Sat. Br. XII, 7, 2. 10). The chief characteristic of it is the offering of sura ( wine ) in it. In modern times milk is offered in place of sura in the Sautrāmapi. According to Lāt. V. 4. 20 and Ap. XIX, 5. 1 there are two kinds of this rite, viz. Kaukili and Caraka-sautrāmaņi (or the ordinary one). Kaukill is an independent rite, while the ordinary Sautrāmaņl is performed at the end of the Rajasdya (one month after it ) and also at the end of the piling of the fire-altar ( agniosyana ). Lat. V. 4. 21 states that there is chanting of sāmans only in the Kaukill and not in the other variety and according to Kāt. XIX, 5. 1 (oom.) it is the brahmā that chants the Sāman to Indra in the Bịhati tune ( viz. Vāj. 8. XX. 30 ) Ap. XIX, 1. 2. states that in the ordinary sautrā mani the procedure is that of the nirūdh pasubandha and that ( XIX, 5. %) in Kaukill also the same procedure applies. There are two fires as in Varuņapraghasa, but the southern one is not established on a vedi Kat. XIX. 2.1 and V. 4. 12). Some held (as is done by Sat. Br. XII. 7.3.7) there were two vedis behind which two mounds were raised, one for oups of milk and the other for cups of surā. The rite takes four days, during the first three out of which wine is prepared from various ingredients, while on the last day three oups of milk and three of surā are offered to Asvins, Sarasvati and Indra and animals are slaughtered for the same three. 

In this rite the victims are a reddish-white goat for the Asvins, an ewe for Sarasvati, and a bull for Indra Sutraman (San. XV. 15. 1-4, Ašv. III. 9.%). A. brief description of the method in which wine was prepared in the Sautrāmaņi is given below from the Sat. Br. V, 5, 4, XII. 7. 2, Kat. XV. 9. 28-30, 

2660, The word Sautrāmaņi is derived from sutraman (& good protector ), an epithet of Indra (vide Rg. X. 131. 6-7). Sat. Br. V. 6. 4. 12 derives it as one who was well suvod (by the Advias)'.

Rice-grainas61 ( or malted rice grains and maltod barley or syömāka ) germinated and un germinated covered in linen oloth are purchased from an eunuch in exchange for lead, wool and fried grain for thread. This purchase takes place on the southern one of the Vedis specially prepared for this rite near the peg called antahpatya on a hide. The rios grains are cooked in plenty of water and the malted barley grains are powdered and boiled. The water and scum are strained through woollen cloth. The hair of the lion, the wolf and the tiger are thrown into the mixture (this is symbolio of the charaoteristics of prow e88, impetuosity and fury found in those wild beasts ). Certain vegetable substances such as myrobalans, ginger, nutmeg ( which serve as yeast and are mentioned in the note below ), are powdered and boiled in plenty of water. The hot watery scum from the two pots of boiled rice and powdered barley is taken into two vessels and the extract of vegetables is poured in both of them, the mixture being called māsara. The boiled rice and barley are also mixed with the extract of powdered vegetables, put in a kumbhi ( a big jar ) along with contents of the māgara vessels and the jar is placed in a pit dug to the south-west of the sacrificial hall and kept there for three nights. On the first day the milk of one cow meant for Afrins is poured into the kumbbi placed in the pit and powder of daşpa is added. The next day the milk of two cows meant for Sarasvati is poured into the kumbhi and powder of tokma is added. On the third milk of three cows meant for Indra is added and also the powder of fried rice grains ( laja). To the west of the mound prepared on the southern vedi a pit is dug ( outside the vedi according to com. on Kāt. XIX, 2. 7.) on which is spread bull's hide over whiob & giove of bamboo is held and the liquid from the large jar is poured over the sieve (called kārotara ).346% The wine thus purified is collected in a

Of this parified wine the pratiprastbāte fills the cups for being offered to the three deities, viz. the Advins, Sarasvati and Indra. Either one or three cups are illed for each of the three deities ( Kat. XV, 10. 13). This is done after the offering of the omentum and after mārjana. According to Ap. XIX, 2. 9-11 and Kato XV, 10.12 powders of kuvala, karkandhū and badara fruits are added to the wine in the cups and they are offered in the daksiņa fire (Kat. XV. 10. 17). There was only one puronu. vaky, one praisa and one yajya for all oups.3468 On the dakşiņa fire & Vessel having a hundred holes covered with a hair strainer and gold and containing the remnants of the wine cups was hung by means of a sikya and the triokling drops of wine were offered to pitrs called Somavat, Barbişad and Agnişvātta with Vaj, S. XIX. 52-60. It is to be noted that the remnants of the wine were not drunk by the priests, but were either drunk by a brāhmaṇa hired for the purpose ( Ap. XIX. 3.3) or they were poured over an ant-hill. Ašv. (III. 9.5-6) says that the priests muttered a verse ( which is Vāj. 8. XIX. 35 ) and only smelt the remnants of the wine offered (this is called prānabhakşa ). San. notes that some teachers recited the puronuvākya, yājyā and praisa in an entirely changed form ( probably as directly mentioning only surt and not in the phraseology of soma ) but it should not be so done, since that is a method fit only for asuras. From this one may plausibly argue that the Sautrāmaņi was practised among Asuras ( non Aryan people or schismatics ) and was adopted by the Vedic Aryans, with appropriate changes. But it is clear that the drinking of sura bg priests was condemned even then. 3864 Eggel

ing ( in 8. B. E. vol. 44 p. 246 n) does not appear to be right so far at least as the sūtra literature goes when he says that the priests drank the remnants of the wine cups ( though the Sat. Br. uses the somewhat doubtful word 'bhakşayanti' which in the sūtras also means smelling '). 

All three animals in the sautrāmani may be goats. A fourth snimal was offered to Bphaspati under oertain circumstances ( Ap. XIX. 2. 1-2). Though the omentum of the victims was offered to Asving, Sarasvati and Indra, the pasupurodāgas were offered to Indra, Savity and Varupa ( Asv. III. 9.2). This rite was performed at the end of Rajasaya or for one who performs cayana or for one who suffers from purging due to excessive drinking of soma beverage or who vomits soma or from the openings of whose body (except the mouth ) soma flows out. The independent (kaukili ) sautrāmaņl was performed for & brāhmaṇa who desired prosperity, or for a king who was driven from his kingdom or for one who had no cattle (Kat. XIX. 1. 2-4). In the beginning and at the end there was & caru to Vditi. 

The northern vedi is in extent only one-third of the vedi for a soma sacrifice. When the attar&vedi is being prepared the pratiprasthātr takes earth from the catrāla pit, makes & mound to the south of the uttaravedi, a second mound for keeping wine cups in front of the dakşiņa fire, brings fire from the daksina fire and establishes it on the mound which is to the south of the uttarayedi. According to Kat. XIX. 2. 11 (which is part of the description of the independent sautrāmapi) the adhvaryu purifies on the northern vedi milk contained in & vessel made of reeds ( vetasa ) and fills oups of milk, the one for Asvins being made of asvattha wood, and those for Sarasvati and Indra being made of udumbara and nyagrodha. The three cups of milk are offered together by the adhvaryu. After the offering to Vanaspati in the animal sacrifice & couob of muñja cords is placed between the two vedis and the sacri. ficer sits on the couch which is covered with a black antelope skin with a silver piece under his left foot and a golden one under his right foot. The adhvaryu offers thirty-two oups of vasā ( fat ) from vessels made of the hoofs of bulls with Vāj. 8. XIX. 80-95. The remnants of fat are contained in a sata ( vessel ) of reeds. The adhvaryu sprinkles over the yajamāna whose body has been rendered fragrant with unguents the liquid from that vessel till it triokles down up to his mouth. The adhvaryu touches the sgorificer who summons his men

and servants calling them by auspicious names (such as susloka). The men lift him gradually first up to the knee, then up to the navel &o. The sacrificer alights on & blsok antelope skin when a 33rd cup of fat is taken, & sāman in the Bțbat tune for Indra (Vāj 8. XX30) is chanted by the brahma priest and the nidhana (finale) of it differs according to the varpa of the sacrifioera and is sung in chorus by all and then the 33rd cup is offered. There is the final purificatory bath as in Somayāga. Finally, after the caru to Aditi mikşa is offered to Mitra and Varuņa and then an animal to Indra Vayodhas. Jaimini lays down certain propositions about the Sautramani. In III. 5. 14-15 he states that all the contents of the grabas of milk are offered in the fire on the northern vedi and of the wine cups into the southern fire and nothing is left out of them for being offered as Svietakýt offering or for the purpose of ida. In IV. 3.29-31 it is established that when the Vedic text says 'after piling the fire altar one should perform Sautrāmani' there is no injunction about the time of performing Sautrāmapi but what is deolared is that the Sautrāmaņi is an anga (& subordinate constituent ) of the principal rite viz. agnionyana and in IX, 3. 40-41 it is stated with reference to the same text that the sautrāmaņl is not necessarily performed immediately after agnicayana but on the Full Moon day or New Moon day thereafter. In VIII. 2. 1-9 Jaimini declares that though the surā offered in Sautrāmant is spoken of as soma and though several actions such as purchase of surā, tying in cloth are common to surā and soma, the general procedure to be followed in Sautrāmani is that of darśapūrņamāss and not of soma sacrifice and that surā lo spoken of as soma by way of lauding the offering of wine oups.2668 

Ašvamedha ( Horse-sacrifice ). This is one of the most ancient sacrifices, Rg. I. 162 and 163 show that the horse-Baorifice was in vogue long before the com position of those two hymns. It was believed, as said above

( on p. 982 ), by the composer of those hymns that the horse when sæorifoed went to heaven. A goat was led in front of the horse ( Rg. I. 162. 2-3 and I. 163. 12). The horse was deoked with ornaments, it was anointed with the svaru ( L. 162. 9 ) and it perambulated fire thrice or fire was carried round it thrice ( I. 162. 4 ); cloth and a piece of gold are provided for the dead body of the horse to lie down upon ( 1. 162, 16 ). Horse's flesh was cooked in a pot called ukha ( I. 162. 13 ) and offered in fire (I. 162, 19 ); 34 ribs are mentioned in Rg. I. 162. 18, while 26 ribs are mentioned in other texts with reference to the goat. It appears that āgūḥ, yājy, and vaşatkār& were uttered in making offerings of the horse's flesh (Rg. I. 162. 15 ). The horse is identified with Aditya, Trita and Yama ( Rg. I. 163. 3 ). 

This rite is described in the Sat. Br. XIII. 1-5, Tsi. Br. III. 8-9, in which several anoient monarchs are (onumeiated who performed the Aśramedha. The Tai. Br. III. 8. 9 identi fies the Asvamedha with the kingdom *666 and states 'he, who being weak, offers an Advamedha, is indeed thrown away (lit. spilt away ). If the enemies ( of the king) wore to secure the horse, the sacrifice would be destroyed'. The sūtras olosely follow the Brāhmaṇas. The Ašvamedha is deemed in the sūtras to be an ahina of three pressing days ( Ašv. X, 8. 1, com. on Kat. XX, 1. 1., San. XVI. 1. 2). A paramount sovereign (sarvabhauma) or & crowned king who is not a sārva bhauma may perform this sacrifice (Ap. XX. 1. 1, Lat. IX 10. 17). A$v. X, 6. 1 states (probably following the Alt. Br. about the Mahabhişeka in Rajasūya ) that one who desires to secure all objects, to win all viotories (including one over his own senses) and to attain all prosperity may perform Advamedha. *** A beginning is made on the 8th or 9th of the bright half of Phālguna or on the same days of Jyeşthe or

Asadba according to some ( Kat. XX. 1. 2-3, Lat. IX. 9. 6-7). Ap. holds that it should be begun on the Full Moon of Caitra ( XX, 1. 4). Rice from four vessels, four añjalis and four handfuls is cooked (it is called brahmaudana); it is smeared with ghee and given to the four principal priests who are also given one thousand cows each and gold weighing one hundred berries (Kat. XX, 1. 4-6, Lat. IX. 9. 8). Two iştis are per formed, the first for Agni Mürdbanvan and the 2nd for Paşan (Asv. X. 6. 2-5, Kat. XX 1. 25 ). The yajamāna cuts off his hair, pares his nails, brushes the teeth, batbes, pubg on now garments, wears a golden ornament (nişka ), observes silence. Vide Tai. Br. III. 8. 1 and Ap. XX. 4. 9-14 for these. His four queens well-decked and wearing nişkas oome near the king, the crowned queen accompanied by princesses, the 2nd queen (vāvāta, the favourite one ) accompanied by daughters of kşam triyas, the third ( parivíkti, the discarded one ) accompanied by daughters of sūtas and village beadmen and the fourth (pāla gall, of low origin ) accompanied by daughters of kşattps (chamberlains ) and sarngrahitrs. 8888 The yajamana enters the fire-hall and sits to the west of the garhapatys facing the north. 

Various rules are stated about the horse's colour and other qualities (Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 2. 4, Kat. XX. 1. 29–35, Lat. IX. 9.4). The horse must be all white with dark circular spots and of great speed, or the front part of its body may be dark and the rest of the body white, or it may have a tuft of dark blue hair. The horse is sprinkled with holy water by the four principal priests standing in the four directions (from the east), each surrounded respeotively by a hundred princes, a hundred ugras who are not kings, by sūtas and village headmen, and by chamberlains and samgrahitrs ( Ap. XX. 4, Sat, XIV. 1. 31). A dog with four eyes (i.e. having two natural eyes and two depressions in the skin above the eyes ) is killed by a man of the dyogava caste or by & voluptuary with the pastle of sidhraka wood. The horse is made to enter water and the corpse of the dog is with a loop of reeds made to float under the horse (Ap. XX. 3.6-13, Kat, XX. 1. 38 ff., Sat, XIV. 1. 30-34). The horse is brought near the fire and offerings are made in the fire till the water ceases to drip down from the horse's body (Kat. XX. %. 3-5). A girdle made of muñja grass or of

darbbas 12 or 13 aratnis long and smeared with the ajya that remains after being poured over the brahmaudana is invoked with the mantra "imam magpbhpan rašanām ptasya' (Tai. 8. IV. I. 2. 1, Vaj. S. 22. %) and the horse is bound with it after taking the permission of the brahmā priest. The horse, having water sprinkled over it with mantras and after the sacrificer repeats into its right ear the several appellations for a horse ( Āp. XX. 5.1-9), is let off to roam over the country aooom panied by four hundred guards with the mantra 'O gode, the guardians of quarters, protect this horse &o. (Vaj. S. XXII. 19, Tai, S. VII. 1. 12. 1). The guards include one hundred princes deserving to be seated on couches in the presence of the king, wearing armour and the other guards are armed with swords, arrows and thick clubs according to their rank (Tai. Br. III. 8.9, Ap. XX. 5. 10-14, Kat. XX. 2. 11 ). The horse is allowed to roam for a year where it likes and is not made to turn back, but it is prevented from associating with maros or plunging into water for a bath ( Kāt. XX. 2. 12-13). While doing their duty of guarding the horse, the guards are to subsist by demanding food from brāhmaṇas who do not know the procedure of Asyamedha ( or depriving them of it) or on cooked food taken from all brābmapas; they may stay in the houses of chariot-makers ( Āp. XX. 5. 15-18, Kat. XX. %. 15-16 ). Every day during the year that the horse is absent, three iştis are offered to Savitr in the morning, mid-day and evening, when Savitp is respectively addressed as Satyaprabava, Prasa vitr and Asavitr: (Aøv. X, 6. 8, Lat. IX. 9. 10, Kat. XX. 2.6). When the prayāja offerings are made a brāhmaṇa ( other than the priests ) with a viņ& chants three laudatory gāthās in honour of the king composed by himself stating 'you donated this, you performed such and such a sacrifice, you cooked food for distribution' (Ap. XX, 6, 5, Kāt. XX, 2.7). This singing took place thrice a day after the işti to Savitr (Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 2. 8-14, Tai. Br. III. 9. 14). A ksatriya lute player also sang three laudatory songs (Sat. Br. XIII. 1.5, 6, Ap. XX. 6. 14 ) referring to the battles fought and victories won by the saori. ficer. Every day for a year after the işti to Savitr is finished the hots sitting on a golden cushion to the south of the ābavaniya fire recites to the crowned king surrounded by his Bons and ministers the narratives called 'Pāriplava' (revolving or recurring legends ). When about to commence the Pāriplava the bott makes the summons 'adhvaryog' and the adhvaryu geated on a golden seat (with four legs) responds with ho

hotar' (Asv. X. 8. 10-13).6668 The other priests also sit down on cushions or boards and bands of singers holding lutes sit down to the south and sing of the good deeds of the king along with those of his ancestors ( Āp. XX. 6. 13). As the king is thus engaged in sacrifices and in listening to the Pariplava!070 and to the songs, Ap. ( XX, 3. 1-2) notes that, till the Afvamedha is performed, the adhvaryu becomes the king, as the sacrificer (the orowned king ) declares 'O brāhmaṇas and nobles / this adhvaryu is your king. Whatever honour you (usually pay to me) should be paid to him. May wbatever he does be regarded as done by you.' Aøv. (X. 7.1-10) sets out what the Pāriplava is. Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 3 and Śān. XVI. % also deal at length with the Pariplava and they agree with Asy, in most places. For ten days one after another different texts are recited and this goes on for a year in narrative oycles of ten days. On the first day the hotr says 'Manu was the son of Vivasvat, men are his subjects and points at the house-holders sitting down in the sacrificial ball with they (men as subjects of Manu) are here sitting down and then recites some one hymn of the Rg voda saying 'to-day the Veda is that of pks.' On the second day he says ' Yama is the son of Vivasvat, the pitfs are his subjects and points to the old men assembled and recites one anuvāka from the Yajurveda. On the 3rd day Varuna and the gandharvas ( as his subjects identified with fine looking young men ) are mentioned and some hymn from the Atharva-veda dealing with diseases and their cure was narrated. On the 4th day the narration relates to Soma, son of Vişnu and Apsarases ( identified with beautiful young women), and some

On the 7th the narration relates to Asita Dhānvana, bis subjects the Asuras and usurers and some illusion (a trick ) from Asura lore, on the 8th day to Matsya Sāmada, his subjects aquatio animals, Puñjişthas (fishermen) from Matsya country and some Purāņa passage from the Purana-Veda, on the 9th to Tārksya, son of Vipascit, his subjects the birds and brahma carins and some narrative (itihāsa ) from the itihāsaveda; on the 10th day Dharma Indra, his subjects the gods and the young śrotriyas who accept no gifts, and some sāman from the Samaveda. Every day for a year in the evening four oblations called Dhřti were made in the abavaniya (Kat. XX. 3. 4). On the first day 49 homas called Prakramas were made in the dakşiņa fire with Vāj. S. XXII. 7-8 (beginning with 'biņkaraya svaha'). Vide Sat. Br. XIII. 1, 3, 5, Tai. S. VII. 1. 19. In this way the Savitri iştis, singing, listening to Pāriplava and Dhrti offerings went on for a year. For a year the sacrificer kept observances as in the Rājasūya ( Lāt. IX. 9. 14). Large fees were given to the hotp and adhvaryu (Lat. IX. 9, 12-13 and 16) and to the singers (Kat. XX, 3.7). 

Several expiatory ceremonies are prescribed (Ap. XXII. 7. 9-20, Kāt. XX. 3. 13-21) if the horse died or suffered from disease. If the horse was carried away by an enemy the sacrifice was destroyed. At the end of the year the horse was brought to a stable and the sacrificer underwent dikşā (initia tion). There were 12 dikşās, 12 upapads and three sutya days ( days on whioh some was pressed). Vide Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 4.1, Ašv. X. 8.1, Lat. IX. 9.17. After the dikşā the sacrificer is sung as on a par with the gods and on the pressing days, at the time of svabbftha, the udayanlyā işti, the anubandhya and the udava. gāniya he is spoken of as on a par with Prajapati.1671 There are 21 yūpas ( stakes ) all being 21 aratnis high.

Large numbers of animals are tied at all these stakes and slaughtered. Even wild animals like boars and birds are bound and held between the intervals of the yüpas ( Ap. XX, 14. 2 ff.). Vide Vāj. S. XXIV for a list of hundreds of animals out of which those from Kapiñjala onwards (Vaj. S. XXIV. 20 ff.) are let off after fire is carried round them (Kat. XX. 6. 9, Ap. XX, 17, 5). The 2nd among the three pressing days is the most important and is full of several very striking matters (such as the ribald dialogue, the brahmodya &c.). The horse to be sacrificed is yoked to a chariot along with three horses, the adhvaryu and Bacrifioer occupy the chariot and take it to a lake or reservoir of water, make the horses enter it (Kat. XX, 5. 11-14). On the horse's return to the sacrificial ground it is anointed with clarified butter by the crowned queen, the favourite queen and the discarded queen in the front, the middle and hind parts of its body respectively. They also respectively tie 101 golden beads on the head, mane and tail of the horse with bhūh, bhuvah and sval. They give the remnants of the previous night's offering to the horse with Vāj. S. XXIII. 8. If it does not eat it the remnants are cast into water. Near the yüpa a dialogue takes place between the hot who asks 'who wanders alone (Vaj. S. XXIII. 9) and 'who was the first to be thought of' (Vaj. S. XXIII. 11 ) and the brahmi replies with Vāj. 8. XXIII. 10 and 12 respectively. The horse is praised by repeating Rg. I. 163 (Aøv, X. 8.5). A piece of cloth is spread over grass, thereon a mantle is spread and a gold piece is placed thereon and the horse is killed thereon. Before the words 'adhrigo kamidhyam' in the adhrigu praişa Rg. I. 162 and Rg. I. 163. 12-13 are to be recited. When the horse is killed, the wives of the king go round it thrice from left to right with 'gaņānām tvā', thrice from right to left with 'priyāņām tra' and again thrice from left with 'nidhinām tva' (all in Vaj. S. XXIII. 19). They fan the dead horse with their garments while braiding their hair on the right side upwards loosening the hair on the left side and strike their left thighs with their right handa (Ap. XXII. 17. 13, Aøv, X. 8. 8). The crowned queen lies down by the side of the dead horse and both are covered by the adhvaryu with the mantle on which the horse lies and she unites with it (Ap. XXII. 18. 3-4, Kat. XX 6.15-16). Then according to Asv. X. 8. 10-13 outside the Vedi the hotf abuses the crowned queen in obscena language and

she returns the abuse along with her one bundred attendant princesses and the brahmā priest and the favourite wife enter into a similar obscene abuse. According to Kāt. XX. 6. 18 the four principal priests and the chamberlain enter into an obscene abusive dialogue (given in Vāj. S. XXIII. 22-31 ) with the queeds along with their young female attendants. Vide Šat. Br. XIII. %. 9 and Lat. IX. 10. 3-6. The attendant princesses raise the crowned queen from near the horse with 'dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39. 6 = Vāj. S. XXIII. 32). The horse is cut up with golden, silver and iron (lauhi may mean copper) needles by the crowned queen, the favourite queen and the discarded one with Vāj. S. XXIII. 33-38. They take out the fat of the dead horse in place of the omentum taken from the goat in other sacrifices (Ap. XXII. 18. 10-11, Kat. XX.7.7). The blood of the horse is cooked and offered at the end of the other offerings to sviştakt (Ap. XXII. 19. 10 and Kāt. XX. 8. 8.). Before the omentum of the animals meant for Prajapati is offered there is brahmodya (a theological dialogue, where questions and riddles are propounded and answers given) between the priests in the sadas. According to Afv. X. 9. 2-3 at first the hot; asks the adhvaryu' who roams alone &c.' (Vaj. S. 23. 45 ) and the adlvaryu replies 'the sun roams alone &c.' (Vāj, S. 23. 46 ). Then the hots again asks 'what light is like the sun's &c.' (Vāj. S. 23. 47 ) and the adhvaryu replies 'truth is light equal to the sun &o.' (Vaj. 8. 23. 48, which however reads 'brahma süryasamam'). Then the brahmā priest asks udgātand he replies ( Vāj. 8. 23. 49-50), then the udgātr asks & question and the brahmā replies (Vaj. S. 23. 51-5%). Then the four priests come out and each asks the saorificer who sits faoing the east the question 'I ask you the furthest limit of the earth &o.' (Rg. I. 164. 34) and the sacrificer replies 'this vedi is the furthest limit' (Rg. I. 164. 35 ). Vide Lat. IX. 10. 9-14 for almost the same questions and answers. 2872 Kāt. (XX. 7. 10-15) mentions Vaj. S. XXIII. 49-62 as the dialogue that takes place at this stage in the Aśramedha and states that Rg. I. 164, 34 ( = Vāj. 8, XXIII. 61 ) is the question propounded by the sacrifioer (and not by the priests as Asv. Say8). Two grahas called Mahiman are offered, one before the omentum is

Offerings of the vapā of all animals are made to the several deities of whom Prajapati is the last. Then the king sits on a lion's or tiger's skin, a piece of gold is placed on his head with Rg. I. 90. 1, a bull bide is held over his head, he is sprinkled with the remnants (samerāya ) of the offerings called mahiman and offerings are made to the twelve months, Madhu, Madhava &o. and seasons Vasanta &o. After the several offerings, on the third pressing day, the sacrificer performs the final purifi. catory bath. At the end of the avabhrtha işti, on the head of & bald man, 2873 whose eye-balls are yellowish-brown, who has prominent teeth, who is suffering from white leprosy and who dips into water, an offering is made ( three according to Ap. XX. 22. 6) with the words to Jumbaka, svābā' (Vāj. S. XXV. 9). Vide Kāt. XX. 8. 16, Sān. XVI. 18. 18 and Sat. XIV. 5. 4. The latter add two important details, viz. that the man should be of the Atri gotra and that he should enter such deep water that it should flood his mouth. The Tai. Br. III. 9. 15 says that the abuti 'to Jumbaka, svābā' is the last in Ašvamedha and that Jumbaka means Varuņa. A hundred dows and & cart to which bulls are yoked are given to him. When the sacrificer comes out of the water after avabhștha persons guilty of such grave sins as brāhmana murder plunge into that water and become purified without having performed the penances prescribed for such sins (Kāt. XX.8.17-18).3074 

Apart from the gifts provided for many of the subordinate rites performed in the Aśramedha, Lat. (IX. 10. 15-IX. 11. 4) presoribes that on the first and last of the three soma pressing days he should donate a thousand cows and on the second day he should donate all the wealth that belongs to the non brahmana residents in one district ( ja napada ) out of his realm,

or he should donate to the hotr the wealth in the eastern part of the country conquered by him and the wealth in the southern, western and northern parts respectively to the brahma, adhvaryu and udgāt; and their assistants or he should at least donate 48,000 cows to each of the four principal priests, 24000, 12000, 6000 to each of the four groups of three assistants of the principal priests in order. Aģv, X. 10. 10 also says that he should donate the wealth of non-brāhmaṇas in the four conquered quarters except land and human beings. Kāt. (XX. 4.27-28) contains similar rules. 

Even in ancient times this sacrifice must have been rare. The Tai. S. V. 4. 12. 3 and Sat. Br. XIII. 3. 3. 6 both state that the Aśvamedha was a sacrifice which was utsanna (gone out of vogue). The Atharvaveda (XI. 7. 7-8) also appears to regard the Rājasûya, Vajapeya, Ašvamedha, the sattras and several other sacrifices as utsanna. The origin of the rite is obscure. In it several popular, religious and symbolical ele ments are inextricably blended and some rites like the queen lying down near the dead horse must be regarded as unaccount 'able survivals from the hoary past. Various theories bave been 

advanced to account for the origin, but there is, as is to be expected, - no agreement among scholars. Vide S. B. E. vol. 44. pp. XVIII-XXXIII, Prof, Keith's Introduction to Tai. S. pp. CXXXII ff. and 'Religion and Philosophy of the Veda' part 2 pp. 345-347 for the several theories of European soholars. . In the Āśyamedhika parva of the Mahābhārata Ašvamedha is described at some length. It is probable that in the epio only the popular elements and a few of the religious rites were emphasized. In chap. 71. 16 Vyāsa tells Yudhisthira that the Ašvamedha purifies a person of all sins.8675 The dikşā took place on the full moon of Caitra (72.4). The sphya, kūroas and utensils were made of or inlaid with gold (72, 9-10). The greatest warrior of the day, Arjuna, was appointed to guard the horse during its rambles for a year, and he was asked to avoid battle and carnage as far as possible ( 72. 23-24). The horse was kronasāra (marked with dark spots, 73. 8). Arjuna WAS accompanied by a pupil of Yājñavalkya and many learned brahmanas (73. 18) for the performance of propitiatory rites (banti). No indication is given as to the number of soldiers

that accompanied Arjuna. The horse is said to have wandered over the whole of India from east to south, then went to north. After many fights with opponents Arjuna meets death at the hands of his son Babhruvāhang, king of Manipura, whom he upbraided for meek submission, but is brought back to life by his wife Ulūpi, the Nāga princess (chap. 80). Arjuna spares the lives of the opponents whom he vanquishes and invites them to the sacrifice. The description of the sacrifice follows the general outline given above. But there is hardly any detailed or graphic description of the special features of Aśramedha and one rather carries the impression that the author does not depict what he has seen but only what he has heard or read. The pravargya (88.21) and the pressing of soma are mentioned (88. 22). There were six yüpag of bilva, 6 of kbadira, two of devadāru and one of bleşmātaka ( 88. 27-28). Bull's heads and aquatio animals were built into the fire altar ( 88. 34). Draupadi was made to lie by the dead horse (89. 2-3). There are several points of difference. The altar is shaped like & Garuda (88, 32), the bricks were of gold, and 300 animals were sacrificed. It is said that the vapā of the horse was offered (89. 3), while Ap. (XX. 18. 11) emphatically states that there is no vepā in the oase of the horse. Great emphasis is laid on the buge masses of food distributed to all, on the drinking bouts and singing parties and the feeding of the poor and helpless (88, 23, 89. 39-43). Crores of nişkas were donated to brāhmaṇas and the whole earth to Vysa (89. 8-10) who returned it to Yudhisthira for gold to be given to him and to brāhmaṇas. The Bālakāņda of Rāmāyaṇa (chap. 13-14 ) contains & more graphic descrip tion of the Aśramedha performed by Dasaratha for securing sons. It expressly refers to the Kalpasūtra (tryahosāvamedhaḥ sarkhyātaḥ kalpasūtreņa brāhmaṇaih). 

In I. A. vol. VIII. p. 273 ( at p. 278) we find that a general, called Udayacandra, of Nandivarma Pallavamalla (about the 9th century A. D.) defeated Pșthivivyāghra, king of Nişadha, who had accompanied the horse in his horse sacrifice. In E. O. vol. X. Kolar No. 63 it is stated in an inscription of 757 A. D. that the Calukya emperor Pulakośi was purified by his bath at an Aśramedha. In the very ancient Nanagbat Inscription (A.S. W. I. vol. V. pp. 60-61) an Andhra king8876 is described as

Sattra It was shown above (pp. 1213-1214 ) that the Dyādaśaha sacrifice partook of the characteristics of both ahina and a sattro and a few points of difference between the two were also set out there. Sattras are sacrificial sessions, the duration of which varies from 12 days to a year or more. Their archetype (prakrti) is the Dvādaśāha (Āśv. XI. 1.7). Sattras again may for conve nience be divided into those called Ratrisattras and those called Samvatsarika ( carried on for a year or more ). Ašv. (XI. 1. 8-XI. 6. 16 ) and Kāt. ( XXIV. 1-3 ) speak of numerous Rātrisattras called Trayodasarātra and so on up to Satarātra, state the principles on which these sattras are evolved from the Dvādaśaba, the model, and set out the schemes of all of them, If only one day has to be added then it is the Mahāvrata that is added before the last day called Udayanly&. If two or more days are required to be added then they are added before the Dasarātra ( that forms the central part of the Drādagaha and comes after the Prðyapiya day). In the case of Rātrisattras of mapy days' duration şadahas are added (Kāt. XXIV. 1.5-7, Aśv. XI. 1. 8-14); the Dasarātra is never repeated but is only one in the same sa ttra (Kat. XXIV. 3. 34). For want of space all the Rātrisattras will be passed over. The Gavām-ayana 2878 (lit, the course or way of the cow. i. e, the sun's rays or days) is the model of all Samvatsarika sattras (Aøv, XI. 7. 1 and com., Jai. VIII, 1.8, Kāt. XXIV. 4. 2). Several battres of the duration of one year or more are mentioned in the sūtra texts such as Adityānām-ayana (Asv. XII. 1. 1), Angirasām-ayana

Gavām-ayana which is a Sāmvatsarika gattra (extending over 12 months of 30 days each) consists of the following parts (Tindya XXIV. 20. 1, Āśv. XI. 1. 2-6 and 7. 2-12, Sat. XVI. 5. 18-40, Ap. XXI. 15 ff.):

Gavām-arjana 

1241 

The Gavām-ayana was performed for various rewards viz. progeny, prosperity, plenty (or greatness), high position, heaven (Ap. XXI. 15. 1, Sat. XVI. 5. 14). About the day on which dikşā (initiation) for it took place there were several views. The Ait. Br. (19. 4) prescribes that it should be done either in Māgha or Phalguna. Some (Sat. XVI. 5. 16-17, Ap. XXI. 15. 5-6 ) said that dikşā took place four days before the Full Moon of Māgba or Caitra. Vide Lāț. X. 5. 18-19, Kat. XIII. 1,2-10 for the several days. Jai. VI. 5. 30-37 and Kat. XIII. 1. 8 favour the view that the diksa should be undertaken four days before the Full Moon day of Māgha ( i. e. on ekādası day ) since the Vedio texts prescribe the Ekāstakā day of Māgha (i. e. 8th of dark half ) for the purpose of some ( after 12 days of dikşā). In the Gavām-ayana the procedure of the Dvādaśāba as a sattra is to be followed (Ap. XXI. 15, 2-3, Jai. VIII. 1. 17), but some held that in Gavām-ayana there were to be 17 dikşās ( instead of 12). There are certain general rules about sattras which may be stated here. They are to be performed by many as sacrificers and only brāhmaṇas can perform them (Jai. VI. 6. 16-23, Kat. I. 6. 14). There are no separate priests (ptvij), but the yajamānas themselves are the priests (Jai. X. 6. 45-50 and 51-59, Sat. XVI. 1. 21). A text quoted by Sabara on Jai. VI. 2. 1 says that the persons who engage together in & gattre must be at least 17 and not more than 24 and each of the performers secures the same unseen (or spiritual) reward for which the gattra is performed (Jai. VI. 2. 1-2). There is therefore no waraña (choosing ) of priests and there is no question of remunerating them for their servioes by several gifts as in Jyotiştoma (Jai. X, 2, 34-38). At the time when gifts are made in other rites, in sattras the sacrificers perform the Dākşiņa homas and waving their dark antelope skins they go out with their faces turned northwards by the path by which da kşiņas are taken away in other rites (Sat. XVI. 2. 19. Kat. XII. 2. 18). As no dakşiņas are to be donated in sattras agents (oalled sanihāras) are not to be sent for collecting subscriptions ( Sat. XVI. 1. 40). The sacrificial utensils ( yajāapātras like juhū) to be used in the sattra are specially got prepared for the common use of all, while exoh keeps bis own utensils separate with which he is cremated If he dies in the midst of the performance ( Jai. VI. 6. 33-35 ). Though the general rule is that there is no pratinidhi ( substitute ) for the performer of rites like agnihotra, the sattra is an exception, since if any one of the many performers dies in the midst of a 

2. D. 186 

1242 

History of Dharmašāstra 

(Ch. XXXV 

sattra another person may be substituted by the others in his place (Jai. VI. 3.22 ), but he is only an agent secured by pay ment and the spiritual unseen reward of the sacrifice goes to the performer that is dead (Jai. VI. 3. 23-25). The Tāpd ya Br. IX. 8. 1 states that if one of the performers of & saltra dies after dikşā, he should be cremated, his bones should be tied in his antelope-skin and placed beyond the mārjāllys shed and his son or other very near relative should be given dikşā and be associated in the sattra. Only those who have consecrated the three Vedic fires can engage in sattras except in the Sarasvata sattra (Jai. VI. 6. 27-32). According to Jai. (VI. 6.1-11) only those who follow the same procedure can join in the sattra, otherwise difficulty is caused in the case of the Prayājas and the Apri verses. The second prayāja deity in the case of Vasişthas and Sunakas is Narāsaṁsa, while Tanūnapāt is the second prayāja deity in the case of other gotras. After stating the view of Gapagāri that only those who have the same gotra can join in a sattra, Ašy.(XII. 10. 2-3) states the view of Saunaka ( and it is his view also ) that even persons of different gotras may join in a sattra, that where in a particular matter there is a difference of procedure in accor dance with the difference of gotra, the procedure should be regu lated by the gotra of one ( called grhapati) of those who join in the sattra. Jai.(VI.6.24-26) states the somewhat striking rule that even among brāhmaṇas those who belong to the Börgu, Vasiştha and Sunaka gotras cannot join in & sattra but only those who belong to the Viśvāmitra gotra or who have a similar procedure ( about prayājas &c. ), since śruti requires that the function of hotr in a battra must be performed by one belonging to Visvāmitra gotra. If after making a resolve to join in a battre or if after just beginning & battra a man gives up the idea, he had to perform by way of penance the Višvajit rite (Jai, VI. 4, 32 and VI. 5. 25-27). 

Though in & battra all are yajamānas yet one of them becomes the grhapati; those actions whioh only one can perform and which are done in other sacrifices by the yajamāna (except what are samskāras like vapana) are here done by the grhapati alone and others only touch him (e. g. in tying the veda or placing a fuel-stick on fire, Kāt. XII. 1. 9-15). In performing dikşā a peculiar procedure is followed (Kat. XII. 2. 15, Sat. XVI. 1. 36, Ap. XXI. 2. 16-XXI. 3.1). The adhvaryu first gives diksā to the gļhapati and to brahma, hot; and udgātr ; the pratiprastbātf gives diksā to adhvaryu, then to maitrā varupa, 

Ch. XXXV) 

Gavām-ayana 

1243 

brahmanaochamsin and prastoty; the nestr gives dikşā to the pratiprastbātr and the acchāvāka, āgnidhra and pratiharts; the unnetr gives dikşā to nestr, the grāvastut, and subrahmanya and lastly the pratiprasthātr or another brāhmaṇa (who is himeelf a dikşita ) or a Veda student or snātaka gives dikşā to unnetę. Each of the wives of all these is given dikşā along with her husband ( Kāt. XII. 2. 16). Every day one of those who join in a sattra guards soma silently and others are allowed to study their Veda and to fetch fuel-sticks (Sat. Br. IV. 6. 9, 7, Kāt. XII. 4. 1 and 3). On the tenth day there is brabmodya"680 as in Aśvamedha or they engage in the abuse of Prajapati for having created such pests as bees and wasps and thieves (Ap. XXI. 12. 1-3, Sat. XVI. 4. 33-35, Kāt. XII. 4. 21-23). 

While engaged in the battra the performers have to observe certain rules ( Āśv. XII. 8, Drāhyāyana Śr. VII. 3-9 f), From the day the dikşanlyā isti is performed in the sattra, the usual duties to pitřs (such as piņdapitr-yajña), to gods ( suoh as Agnihotra ) are stopped till the end of the sattra. They have to give up sexual intercourse and must not run, they should laugh covering their teeth ( so as not to show them ), should not jest with women, should not speak to those who are not āryas, should not plunge in deep water, should give up falsehood and anger, should not climb up trees or enter & boat or cbariot. Rules are laid down as to whom to bow to. A sattrin should esohew singing, dancing and instrumental music. While dikşās are going on he should subsist on milk. On pressing days he should partake of the remnants of havis only or of fruits and roots and other food fit for vrata. 

One of the most interesting day is the Mabāvrata, which is the last day but one in a sattra. Several strange and bizarre rites are performed on this day. This day is so called because it is specially meant for Prajapati who is 'mahān' and maha. vrata means' anna'( Tāpd ya IV. 10. %, Sat. Br. IV. 6. 4. 2). In this a mahā vratiya oup of soma is offered in addition to the 

2680. The Tagdya Brahmana (IV. 9. 12 and 14 ) speaks of both brahmodya and the parivadana of Prajapati 'ब्रह्मोद्य पदन्ति ममवर्चस एव

usual ones and a victim is slaughtered for Prajā pati. In oon nection with this oup a mabāvrata saman is chanted followed by the recitation of the Mahad-uktha (great laudation) of the hotr. Vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br, p. 283 n, S. B, E. vol. 43 pp. 282–283 pote 5. The chanting of the Prsthastotras is started by a brahmana who plays on a harp ( vāņa ) with a hundred strings of muñja grass (Sat. XVI. 7. 7-9, Tāņdya V.6.12-13). During the chanting the udgātę priest sits on a chair of udumbara, the hoton & swing, the adhvaryu on a board and the other priests on seats of grass (Tandya V.5.1-12). A brābmaņa in the front part of the sadas and a südra at the back alternately belaud and abuse those engaged in the sattra, the former saying they have done well and the latter saying they have not done well ( Tāņdya V. 5. 13). An ārya and a gūdra engage to the west of the agnidors shed in a contest for a white circular skin that symbolizes the sun (for whom the Gods and Asuras fought laying claim to the Sun as their own), the fight being so arranged that it oulminates in favour of the ārya ( Tandya V.5. 14-17, Sat. XVI. 7.28-32). A harlot and a brahmacarin abuse each other on the northern hip of the altar. 

Sexual intercourse between & man and a woman ( that are strangers to the sacrifioe ) takes place in & screened shed to the south of the mārjallya shed (according to Kāt. XIII, 3. 9). This probably is a symbol for indicating creation of the world by Prajāpati to whom the mahāvrata specially appertains. A chariot is made ready to the east of the southern corner of the vedi. A noble or a kşatriya in full armour occupies it, armed with a bow and three arrows. He goes round the vedi thrica and discharges three arrows at a hide but not so as to pierce it through and through (San. XVII. 15 ). 

They beat drums placed on all corners of the vedi and etrike a bull-bide spread over a hole dug to the west of the āgnidbrlya sbed, half inside the vedi and half outside (this is called' bhūmi-dundubhi'). When the priests chant, the wives of the performers act 88 choristers 4681 to the singing priests (Jai. X 4. 8, Sat. XVI. 6. 21, Ap. XXI. 17, 15-16 ) and play on several instruments.

slave girls, placing water jars on their heads dance thrice round the mārjaliga seat, striking the ground with their right feet and singing popular songs ( gāthas ) in which cows are lauded 88 mothers of ghee and wbioh contain words like this is sweet' ( Sat. XVI. 6. 39-41, Ap. XXI. 19. 17-20 and XXI. 20 ). These features of the mahāvrata show that it was some folk festival in the hoary past and was welded on to the solemn vedic sacrifices as & relaxation after the weary days and months of sacrifices. The Ait. Ār. (I and V) gives an esoteric turn to the mahāvrata. In one place it summarizes all the popular features of the Mahavrata.2688 

On the Udayanlye day three anubandhyā cows are offered to Mitrāvaruņa, the Visve Devas and Bphaspati (Kāt. XIII. 4. 4). 

In the Indian Antiquary, vol. 41, Dr. Sham Sastry contributed a series of articles on the Vedic calendar in which he adduced weighty arguments for holding that the Gayāmayans was a symbolio representation of the efforts made to square up the Vedic lunar year with the solar year by adding intercalary days. It is somewhat remarkable and also indioative of the bias of most western scholars that while Prof. Keith in his work on the 'Religion and philosophy of the Veda' refers ad nauseam to all sorts of luoubrations by European scholars on the origins of the Vedic sacrifices, about rain spells and fertility rites and similar lore be does not condescend to notice the views of Dr. Sham Sastry or Mr. Tilak, which have far more probability than many of the learned hypotheses advanced by European scholars who appear to be obsessed by the notion that Vedio usages must be similar to praotices found in the 19th contury among the backward races of Africa, Amerioa and Oceania. 

Though the sūtras speak of sattras for a hundred or a thousand years, there were writers even in ancient India who thought that such sattras did not exist in fact, at least in historical times. Patañjali states in his Mahābhāşya that the sattras of a hundred or a thousand years were never attempted in times near to his day and that Yajñikas prescribe

Among the other sattras the Sarasvata sattras are most instructive, since in them many places on the most sacred Sarasvati and other rivers were approached by the sacrificers during the course of the sacrifice.2885 Vide Āśv, XII, 6., Lat. X. 15 ff, Kāt, XXIV, 6. 14 ff. 

Agnicayana (piling of the fire-altar ) 

The construction of the fire-altar is a special rite and is the most complicated and most recondite of all Srauta sacrifices. The Satapatha Brāhmaṇa devotes five out of its fourteen sec tions ( about one-third of the whole work) to cayana and is the leading work on that subject. Prof. Eggeling in his very learned Introduction ( pp. XIV ff) to vol. 43 of the S. B. E. deals with the fundamental conceptions underlying this srauta ritual. Acoording to him cayana was originally an indepen dent rite and was later on incorporated in the system of Soma sacrifices. At the bottom of this rite are certain cosmogonio theories. Even in the Rgveda we meet with the conceptions that Hiranyagarbha or Prajāpati ( Rg. X. 121 ) is the creator of the universe, that creation, destruction and re-construction of the universe are eternal, ever-recurring processes going on from all time and will go on for all time ( Rg. X. 190.3, 'dhāta yathapūrvam-akalpeyat'), that Puruşa himself became the sacrificial material (havis ) and the year and seasons aided in the process of the reconstruction of the saorificed and dismem. bered Puruşa. Man bimself who is a child of this process must also do his part in the reconstruction of the world. This he can do best by identifying Fire with Prajāpati ( as in Sat. Br. X. 4. 1. 12 ) and regarding Fire as the Highest Divinity and

the source of all life and activity and the periodic performance of sacrifice in fire as his contribution, however small it may be, to the process of re-creation and re-construction. The re constuction of the world by Prajāpati a man oan iwitate by him self constructing an elaborate structure with bricks. The Sat. Br, in several places brings out these ideas, though in a some what esoterio way 2686 (e. g. VI. 2. 2. 21). The tenth kanda (section) of the Sat. Br. is the rahasya (the esoterio doctrine ) of cayana. Most of the acts done in the piling up of the altar are a symbolic representation of the process of re-creation and re-construction as will be seen later on. In the Sat Br. the principal authority on this doctrine of cayana is not Yājña valkya ( who is the dominating figure in the first five seotions of that Brāhmapa) but Saņdilys who traces that doctrine through a succession of teachers to Tura Kāvaşeya who received it from Prajāpati himself (Sat. Br, IX, 5, 2. 15-16, X. 4. 1. 11, X. 6.5.9 &c.). 

A very brief description of the cayana based principally on Kāt., Sat., and Ap. is given below. 

The construction of the fire-altar in five layers is an anga of Somayāga. But cayana is not obligatory in every Boma sacrifice. It must however be performed in the Somuyāga called Mahā vrata (which as stated above is the last but one day in Gavām-ayana). When a man desires to pile the fire altar, he first offers after the Full Moon işti of Phālguna (i, e. on the first of the dark half) or on Māgha new moon five animals (viz. a man, a horso, a bull, & ram and a he-goat were offered, the man in & screened place ).48 87 The heads of the beasts were built up into the altar and their trunks were thrown in water, which was then used for making bricks from clay. Kāt. (XVI. 1. 32) allows an option that instead of killing animals golden or olay heads of these may be used. In modern times when rarely cayana is performed only golden images of the above five are taken. Then on the 8th of the dark half of Phālguns a horse, an ass and a he-goat are taken in procession

2687. It appears that the man was not actually killed, but was let off. He was to be a vaidya or kpatriya (Kit. XVI. 1. 17). According to Baud. X. 9 the beads of a vaisya and of a horse killed in battle are taken 'संग्रामे हतयोरश्वस्य च वैश्यस्य च शिरसी। दीप्यन्त ऋषभ पचन्ते । पाणि च पस्तं

to the south of the ahavaniya fire (the horso leading ) with their mouths to the east and the place from where clay is to be taken is reached by the horse. To the east of the abavaniya a square pit is dug and a ball of clay is put therein which brings the pit on a level with the surrounding ground. At the middle of the distance between the clay lump and the ahavaniya clay taken from an ant-hill is heaped. A spade one oubit long made of some sacrificial tree is kept to the north of the ahava niya. The ant-bill olay is placed on the lump of earth in the pit with that spade. The horse is made to plant its foot on the olay in the pit. He (the priest ) draws three lines with the spade on that lump of olay, spreads black antelope skin to the north of the lump and thereon keeps a lotus leaf on which the lump of clay from the pit is placed and the corners of the skin are tied with a girdle of muñja. He takes up the hide with the clay therein, raises his arms towards the east, bolds the bundle over the animals that come back in the reverse order (the goat leading). According to Ap. XVI. 3. 10 the bundle is placed on the back of the ass and brought near a tent. The lump is placed to the north of the ābavaniya in a tent soreened on all sides; then he takes the hair of the he-goat and mixes the hair in that lump of olay with water in whioh palāsa bark is boiled and mixes therewith gravel, iron rust and small stones. From the olay thus mixed the wife of the sacrificer (or the first wife if there are several) prepares the first brick called Asadha, which is in measure as muoh as the foot of the sacrificer, is rectangular and has three lines scratched on it. The sacrificer prepares an ukha (fire-pan) from the mixture of clay, which is one span in diameter. According to some three pans are made. He also makes three bricks called Visva jyotis, each having three lines and so marked as to show which is first, second and third. The remaining clay is called upasaya and is kept aside ( as it will be required later). The ukha is fumigated with the smoke from seven horse-dung cakes kindled on the dakşiņa fire. A square hole is dug with the spade referred to above, therein fuel is put and the bricks and the ukha ( with the mouth downwards) are put for being baked and more fuel is added. He removes the coals and ashes and takes out during the day the bricks (four) and the ukhā, on which the milk of a she-goat is sprinkled. Thereafter other bricks are made which have three lines on each, whiobh are generally as long as the sacrificer's foot and are baked till they are red.

The dikşā (initiation) for the rite takes place on the amāvāsy. of Phalguna. The dikşapiya işti and other usual rites are performed. Either the yajam.na or the adhvaryu places the ukha on the abavaniya and puts thereon 13 samidhs one span in length. The sacrificer wears a golden ornament with 21 pendants reaching up to his navel. The ukha is taken from the ahavaniya to the east of the abavaniya and is placed in & Sikya and fire is put into it. He carries for a year or a shorter period (12, 6 or 3 days according to Āp. XVI. 9. 1) this fire placed in the ukha. On alternate days in the year he adores the fire with the Vatsapra mantras (Vaj. S. XII. 18-28=Rg. X 45. 1-11), takes the Vişņu strides (Vişnukramas ); he also removes the ashes, puts fuel-stioks on the fire in the ukba. 

Thon follows the building of the altar. The altar has five layers, the first, third and fifth being arranged in the same pattern and the 2nd and 4th being of a different pattern from the 1st, 3rd and 5th. The altar may have several forms such as that of a droņa ( trough ), a chariot-wheel, a syana (hawk), kanka ( heron ), suparpa ( eagle) 8688 &o. Vide Tai. 8. V. 4. 11, Kat. XVI. 5. 9. The altar requires bricks of several shapes ; some are triangular, some are oblong, some are perfectly square, some are oblong plus & triangle (in one). They are not to be placed one over the other as one chooses but are arranged in peculiar ways, some in front, some on the sides and so on. A sound knowledge of geometry and mason craft is required in constructing the altar. Every briok is to be placed after repeating a mantra. The bricks have various names to distinguish them. For example, the brioks called Yajusmati are to be used in building the body ( of the birdlike pattern, which is the most usual one ), but not in building the bides or tail of the layer. The usual mantras in laying down and invoking a briok are two viz. 'taya devatay.. ... sida ( Vāj. 8. XII. 53, Tal. S. IV. 2. 4. 4) and 'td asya süda-dohasal' (Vāl. 8. XIL. 55, Tai. 8. IV. 2. 4. 4). Sat. XI. 8. 18 says that *taya devatay. ... ...dhruvā sida ' is repeated after each briok is doposited. But special mantras are presoribed in several cases 8. g. as to the ten lokampına brioks the mantra is 'lokam prpa! ( VEL. XII. 54, Tai. 8. IV. 2. 4. 4). Some kinds of bricks bear

the names of sages (e. &. Valakhilga bricks ). Probably they were first used by those sages. There are three brioks which are called svayam-atrpņāḥ (1. e. they are long and thin stones and have natural holes ) and which are placed in the centre of the 1st, 3rd and 5th layers and are deemed to represent earth, air and heaven. 2688 Jal. ( V. 3. 17-20 ) deals with the respec tive positions of certain brioks called citrini and lokamprņa. 

On the day of the last dikş& the measuring of the plot to be used as vedi takes place. Measurements are made with a rope which is in length twice the height of the sacrificer. A fifth part of the sacrificer's height is called aratni, tenth part is called pada, each pada is divided into twelve angulas and three pades make a prakrama ( Kat. XVI. 8. 21). The ground for the uttaravedi on which the altar is to be constructed is ploughed with an udumbara plough and the ropes are made of muñja, Six, twelve or twenty-four oxen are yoked to the plough. He sows on the furrows made by the plough various kinds870 of oorns (Ap. XVI. 19. 11-13 gays fourteen kinds, seven being grāmya and geven wild). He omits one kind of corn which he has to abstain from partaking throughout life thereafter (Kat. XVII. 3. 6–7). If so many kinds of corn cannot be had then in those furrows barley corn mixed with honey is sown. Then clods of earth are put thereon and the ground is made level. Several things are got ready and placed one after another on this ground ( Ap. XVI. 13. 10 where they are said to be brioks but not of clay). Vide Sat. XI. 5. 21 also. The placing of bricks is begun after the first upasad ( Sat. XI. 7. %). A lotus leaf is first laid down on the spot where the horse planted its hoof (Ap. XVI. 22. 3) and on that leaf the golden ornament worn by the yajamāna at the time of the Vişnu strides is placed with the mantra 'brahma jajāānam' (Vaj. S. XIII. 3, Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 2). To the south of that ornament is laid down the golden image of a man with head to the east and face turned to the sky in such a way that the image does not cover the hole pierced in the golden ornan ment ( diso ) by passing & string with which it was tied round

the neok ( the mantra repeated being very significant in the beginning Hiranyagarbha arose' Rg. X. 121. 1=Vāj. 8. XIII. 4). The sacrificer performs the adoration ( upasthana ) to the golden man with the three verses bow to the serpents( Vāj. S. XIIL. 6-8, Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3). One should thereafter never go to the north of the image from the south by passing in front of it (i. e. to the east of it). By the side of the two arms of the golden man he places two srucs ( one of kāršmarya wood filled with gbee near the right hand and the other of udumbara filled with curds near the left) with their tops to the east. A briok oalled svayamātrpņā on which ajya is offered and over which the yajamāna breaths is handed over to a brāhmaṇa who places it in the centre with the help of the adhvaryu, the brāhmaṇs being looked upon as fire ( Tai. S. V. %. 8. 2). On that briok a durva creeper is placed in such a way that its roots are on the brick and its tops hang on to the ground towards the east. Then the brick called driyajus is laid to the east of the dūrvā, two retahsio bricks to the east of the preceding, then two stavya bricks and then the Aşādhā brick is placed to the east of the preceding. On all ptavya bricks avakās (mosslike plants ) are deposited. About one aratni to the south of the Aşadhā briok and to the east of the Svayamātrpņā brick he places a living tortoise with its face to the east on the avaka plants ( Āp. XVI. 25. 1, Kāt. XVII. 4. 27-28). The tortoise is anointed with a mixture of ghee, honey and curds, is anveloped in moss covered with a net and made motionless by means 8691 of pegs ( Āp. XVII. 25. 2, Sat. XI. 7. 42). When depositing the tortoise it is invoked with three verses ( Vāj. 8. XIII. 30-32) which express the wish that the tortoise may go to the deep waters, that the sun and fire may not torment it by heat, that it may reach heavenly worlds and that divine rain may follow. Even in modern times a tortoise is so built up into the altar. A mortar *898 and pestle of udumbara wood, each one span in length (the mortar being contracted in the middle and the pestle being rounded ) are placed about one aratni to the north 

2691. The tortoise was probably built up into the altar to imitate the action of Prajapati. Prajapati is said to havo oroatod the world aftor assuming the form of a tortoiso. Vide noto 1716 and p.718 abovo. Or this may be a relio of the widespread usage of playing an animal and burying its body under the foundation of building, a bridge &o.

of the svayamatrpna briok. A sarpa also is placed near the above two (Ap. XVI. 26.5). The ukha filled with sand, ghee and honey is placed on the mortar and offerings of djya are made on it with the sruva ladle. The fire in the ukha is transferred to a hearth with eight bricks in the centre of the fifth layer, on which a second layer of eight bricks ( called punaboiti) is laid. This fire becomes the gārbapatya for the Fire-altar (Sat. Br. VIII. 6. 3. 7-11, Kat. XVII. 12. 18-21 ). Seven pieces of gold are placed on the golden image, the first on the mouth, then two each on the two nostrils, the two eyes and two ears. In the forepart of the ukhā, the heads of the five animals (on which ourds and honey are poured and on which 7 gold pieces are thrust) are placed in a certain order, The human head is in the middle, to the north the heads of the horse and ram and to the south the heads of the bull and goat (Kat. XVII. 5. 13-18, Ap. XVI. 27.5-19). According to Ap. and Sat, the head of a serpent also may be placed ( Ap. XVI. 27. 22, Sat. XI. 7. 63 ) or only the mantras' namo astu sarpebhyaḥ' (Vaj. 8. XIII. 6-8, Tai. S. IV. %. 8. 3) may be recited. The Various kinds of bricks are heaped in various directions on thiok mud spread on the above stated things 80 es to form the first layer, According to Sat. (XI.5. 22) each layer consists of only 200 brioks (1000 for all five), when the sacrificer performs the dayana for the first time; he employs 2000 for all layers when he performs it a second time and this number goes on increasing each time he repeats agnicayana.868 According to the Šat. Br. (S.B.E. vol. 43 p. 22 n. 1), Kat. XVII. 7. 21-23 the bricks required for all the five layers are 10800. The time required for piling also varies. Some held that the piling took one year ( 8 months for the first four layers and 4 months for the last ) or all the layers may be laid in a few days. Sat (XII. 1. 1 ff) and Ap. (XVII. 1. 1-11, XVII. 2. 8, XVII. 3. 1) state that the five layers are laid on five sucoessive days. On each layer thick mud ( purisa ) prepared from the earth (mixed with water) dug out of the catvala pit after touching & dark or bay horse that stands to the north is spread with preto divi' (Vaj. S. XVIII. 73, Tai. 8. I. 5. 11. 1 quoted by Ap. XVI. 34. 6-4, Bat. XI. 5. ). Each layer and the spreading of mud are carried out each day between the two upasads (morn ing one and afternoon one).

oompleted the chavaniya fire is established on the altar so built. Eight dbişnyas, square or round, have to be constructed with bricks, viz. the agnidhriya and 7 others as in somay.ga (but the number of bricks for each differs). A small round and variegated stone ( ašman) is placed to the south of the Igni dhra's place on the northern part of the fire-altar. A fuel-stick is kindled on the new gāshapatya bearth, taken over the syaya. mātspņa brick of the 5th layer and an offering of the milk of a dark cow whose calf is white is made on that fire. Satarudriya homa is offered to Rudra. On the western corner of the northern side of the Fire-altar which is enologed by a line of stones on all sides there are three stones, as high as the knee, naval and mouth on which (serving as ahavaniya) 425 obla tions are offered to Rudra and his fearful aspects by means of the leaf of the Arka plant ( serving as juhu) of wild sesame mixed with gavedhukā. A twig of arka plant is used to clear the leaf of the offerings. The priest faces the north and makes the oblations standing, the mantras being taken from the Satarudriya section (bginning with 'namaste rudra manyave,' Vāj. 8. XVI. 1-66, Tai. 8. IV, 5, 1-10). The arka leaf and twig are thrown into fire. The altar is cooled by the āgaldbra with the water from a jar which is bold over the stone referred to above. The stone is thrown to the south of the altar with 'May sorrow go to him whom we hate' (Vaj. 8. XVII. 1) and if it is not broken the adhvaryu breaks it into pieces. On a long bamboo, a frog, avak: plants and reed (vetasa ) twigs are tied and drawn over the altar from the south bip to the south shoulder 884 and then they are thrown on the utkara. The Gayatra, Rathantara and other sāmans are sung ( Sat. Br. IX. I. 2. 35 ff, Kāt. XVIII. 3. 1 ff). Then follow numerous offerings, viz. one purodaśa to Vaišvānara and 7 purodāsas to the Maruts, 1885 Vasordhara **** ( stream of wealth ) offerings of djya from an udumbara sruo, which is finally thrown into the fire, 6 Partha oblations as in Rājasūya followed later by six

2695. The 7th purodada to the Maruta is called 'tradyo antoy' because the mantra for it. ugrasca bhīmasca' (Vaj, 8. XXXIX. 7) is to bo repeated in a forest. 

2696. Vasordhara is the name of the whole rite in which several hundred offerings are made to Agni with mantras (V&j. 8. XVIII. 1-29, Tai. S. IV. 7. 1-11, Kat. XVIII. 6. 1, Ap. XVII. 17. 8) to socuro all powers of the Firogod to the sacrifioer.

more after the abbişeka of the sacrificer, the Vajaprasaviya 3699 offerings of the mixture of milk and water with the gruel of 14 grāmya and wild corns with an udumbara gruve that is four-cornered like a camasa ( the sruva being thrown into the fire at the end). With the remnants of Vajaprasaviya offerings oolleoted in a pot he sprinkles the sacrificer who sits on a dark antelope skin spread on an udumbara couch to the north of the tail of the fire altar. A royal saorifioer sits on a tiger skin and a vaibya on a goat-skin. After this six Partha offerings are made followed by twelve Rāstrabhrt ( supporting the king dom) homas of ajya with mantras, that contain the words 'vāt' and' svāha'( Vaj. 8. XVIII. 38-43, Tai, S. III. 4. 7). 2698 Then three Vata ( wind ) homas are offered catching with his joined hands wind outside the vedi to the east and the three winds thus caught are represented as yoked to the chariot like horses, the mantra being Vaj. S. XVIII. 45, Tai. S. IV. 7. 12. 3 ( Kat. XVIII. 6. 1-3, Ap. XVII. 20.11 ). 

Then the procedure of Somayāga is followed. One or two special characteristics may be noted. Before the Prātara nuvāka the Fire is represented as yoked after touobing the paridhis and repeating three mantras 'I yoke the fire &c.'(Vaj. S. XVIII. 51-53, Tai. S. IV. 7. 13. 1) and then Agni is released from the yoke before the Agnimāruta stotra (i. e. Yajñāyajñlya) in the evening with a mantra (Vaj. S. XVIII. 54, Tai. S. IV. 3. 4. 2). After the anubandhyā pasu-purodāsa, messes of boiled rice are offered to Anumati, Rākā, Sinivall and Kuhū and a cake on twelve potsherds to Dhats. At the end of the Udavasaniya payasyā is offered to Mitra and Varuņa or he may perform sautrāmaņi ( Ap. XVII. 24. 1, Sat. XII. 7. 14 ). 

2697. The w rite is one rite in wbioh there are two groups of gevon offerings, the first seven with the mantras beginning vajasye mam prasavah' (Vaj. 8. IX. 23-29, Tai. S.

One who has performed the piling of the fire-altar has to observe certain vratas for & year viz. he should not bow to any one, he should not run in the rains, he should not partake of the flesh of any bird, he should not approach a sūdra woman. After he performs agnioayana & second time, he should approach no woman except his own wife of the same caste, when he has performed cayana thrice he should not approach80** oven his own wife ( vide Ap. XVII. 24.1-5, Kāt. XVIII. 6. 25-31, Sat. XII. 7. 15–17). Jai. (II. 3. 21-23 ) declares that the piling of the fire-altar is a samskāra of fire and not an independent yaga by itself. 

If a man does not prosper in the year after he performs agnicayana he may perform punasoiti ( just as punarādheya is performed ). According to Ap. XVII. 24. 11 & punasciti can be performed for three objects, viz. for prosperity, for Vedic lore or for progeny. 8700 

In performing the innumerable and wearisome details of sacrifices many mistakes must have been committed and therefore the Brāhmaṇas and Sūtras presoribe numberless expia tions, some simple and others complicated. But this subject will be dealt with in the next volume under prāyaścittas. 

In the next volume a few remarks will be offered on the philosophical side of sacrifioes and on the causes whereby they gradually faded into the background and gave place to other religious observances. 

2699. The idea appears to have been that the sacrificer was not to disperso tbe spiritual powor acquired by firo-worship, but to consorve it io bimself.
