Festivals of Bhārata

Sri Sri Rangapriya Sri Srih

### Yogic & Vedic Heritage - FESTIVALS OF BHĀRATA

Festivals and Holy Days are very familiar, very important interwoven part of our religious and social life. Leaving aside the holy days, undoubtedly, festivals are objects of natural love to the entire human race. Poet Laureate *Kalidasa*, has observed this truth and says ‘Human beings are fond of festivities’ \(*“utsava priya khalu manuShyaaH”* *shaakuntala Act 6*\). They are especially happy occasions of life. The most common method in which people all over the world celebrate festivals is by getting together with family and friends, enjoying the savory gourmet foods, drinking to the best of their ability \(at times, even spending beyond their means\), singing, dancing and chit chatting to their hearts content, forgetting their troubles, if any. Whenever an opportune occasion arises even animals, birds and vegetation observe the ‘eat, drink, make merry and rest and this verily is the feast’ principle, which brings limited happiness. In addition, since they do not have mental volitions and doubts, worries, and anxieties they immerse more deeply on those merry occasions, enjoy the sensual pleasures, relatively more than us. However, human beings brag of their superiority in statements like “Man is the roof and crown of all things” \(Tennyson\), and ‘there is nothing that compares to human body’ *\(“naratan sama nahEEm kavaniwu dEhee” kaakabhushunDigaruDa samvaada, tulasi raamayaN\)*. If these statements were not to be vain proclamations, but true, the standards of our festival celebrations should rise above the level of animalistic merry making. Each and every one of festivals that we celebrate ought to be rooted in sound judgment, and the planning, decorations, the serenity and the bliss, and the wealth of experience we derive from celebrations should meet even higher standards. These higher standards hinge on the cultural refinement of the practicing communities and they apply to *‘hoLi’* and *deepaavaLi* of Hindus, Bakreed and Ramzaan of Muslims, Easter or Christmas of Christians.

We have reviewed the generic meaning of the festivals. In addition to the festivals, we celebrate holy days known as *“haridina”*. Although this word has distinct conventional and philosophical meaning \(these meanings will be explained subsequently\), we may view these holy days as special occasions set apart for worship. Such holy days are found in every religious tradition that believes in God and in divine incarnations.

Although festivals and holy days, are celebrated by all people, sects, traditions, cultures and nations in a generic form, an in depth study reveals that the festivals and holy days shaped by the *sanaatana aarya bhaarateeya* culture have many distinctive features. The term *“sanaatana”* used here, does not convey the limited meaning ‘that which belongs to ancient times or primeval’. We have to grasp its meaning as ‘eternal’ \(*‘sadaatanasanaatanaaH’*\) as illustrated in the lexicon. In a similar vein, the term ‘aarya’, is not used to convey the idea of a sect of people with a distinguishing skin colour and language as has been interpreted by some of the modern historians. It is used in its true sense ‘one who speaks of the supreme being’, and learned \(scholarly\) preceptors ’ as stated in the following quotations: *\(suShTu eerayanti prakRuSTaarthamiti aaryaaH\)*, *\(“yamaaryaaH kriyaamaNam tu shaMsantvaagamavEdinaH | smRuti chandrikaa, kaa I”\)*. *\(‘yadaaryamasyaamabhilaaShi mE manaH’ shaakuntala anka 1\)*, and \(*nacaavadadhbharturavarNamaaryaa ‘raghuvaMsha sarga 14*\). The term *‘bharateeya’* is not used to refer to people belonging to a sovereign territory which is determined by politics and may change from time to time. We can understand that the intention of using this term is to convey “people engaged in pursuit of spiritual enlightenment” \(*bhaaroopassatyakaamassatya sankalpaH*\), in the spirit of the upanishads. \(Since mother nature has granted this great land for people to lead such a cultured life, we call it the land of *bhaarata* people\). We opine that the festivals and holy days endowed by people engaged in eternal splendor of truth, in this fashion, have special features. Subsequently, we will expound on this opinion, with praiseworthy reasoning \(*yuktipuraHsara*\). We can summarize our opinion here, in the following way: *sanaathana dharma* festivals and holy days are embodied in the knowledge \[of the Supreme Being\] and science \[of creation\]. Great seers, learnt the real form of these festivals by knowledge obtained by deep contemplation while they were in a meditative state, and preached them to us. With divine grace, they understood the intrinsic major and minor limbs of the time embodiment of the divine. They adapted that divine form to body and place. And, based on their findings, they preached very kind heartedly, the path of progression to attain the four fold aims of human existence \(*prushaarthas*\) \[ethical precepts \(*dharma*\), righteous means \(*artha*\), desires \(*kaama*\) and emancipation \(*moksha*\)\]. These festivals are celebrated with many types of sweets and puddings. But, these sweets are not limited to just pleasure of the palate and satiation. ***Sree Rangamahaaguru*** used to remind us, “Sweets and juices consumed that day should not end up in culinary satisfaction only. They should be a feast for pleasing the God *KrishNa* \(*daamOdara*\) ”. Likewise, the various pleasurable activities \(*vihaara*\) on that day, should not end up in limited play of the five senses, they should result in relaxation, as a result of the amorous play of the soul.

What is said above, is the proclamation of the spiritual endeavor. But, if we ask ourselves: Are these festivals and holidays yielding the fruits envisaged by the sages, even in the land that received their priceless gift of culture and tradition? What is their understanding of the festivals? How are they performing them? We cannot honestly answer these questions in the affirmative. We can observe that the gift of the sages is in a reprehensive state and lamentable form . We can analyze this state briefly as follows.

1\)Although we observe many festivals we are not deriving full satisfaction by practicing them, because we do not perform them with wisdom. We recant the words of **Sree Rangamahaaguru** here. “A half asleep child will not experience the nectary taste of the milk feeding. In the same way, unwisely practiced festivals are not oozing the savory essences. They may only help sustain the lingering life of festival culture”. In spite of nourishing feast and merriment, attire and adornments, even the sparse worship we perform and the spiritual stories that we listen to, are yielding only a little bit of satisfaction, since they are being followed without the proper attitude, methods and procedures. The four fold aims of human existence \(*chaturbhadras, purushaarthas*\) wished by the pioneers of the culture are not being realized.

2\)Not only these celebrations are not yielding the promised excellent rewards, but they are also resulting in ominous consequences, since the knowledge of what the practice is, what the object of the practice is, and how it can be used, is lost. To cite an example, the great seers have taught us that all-night vigil on *Shivaraatri* festival is most auspicious. They have prescribed prayers and worship of *Shiva*, in each phase of the night, so that we can attain spiritual wealth, during these invaluably auspicious time periods with special properties. But, many people think that they have to stay awake somehow to accrue virtue, and so, they keep awake by gambling, watching sense teasing erotic movies and other despicable activities. These excursions will not produce peace of mind, rather they disturb the environment and disturb the minds of these observers. If these negative results cause troubles in their lives, some of these misguided people hold *Shiva* and *Shivaraatri* festival responsible for their misfortune\!

3\)Festivals are, no doubt, occasions of great rejoicing and happiness. However, there is no rule that happiness is limited just to the delight of the sense faculties. Even when no food is consumed, such as during *mahaashivaraathri and prathamaikadashi*, these celebrations are known as fasting festivals in our tradition. If one asks, how can the days when no food is consumed be festivals, the answer is that on that day by performing worship of the Almighty, the soul has to experience inner bliss, which is the spiritual food of its true nature. So, in this sense they are also festivals. They are occasions of great rejoicing. \(It is an accepted rule that those whose constitution will get upset without having some food may consume light food.\) On festivals where special foods are prescribed, those who do not have the means to observe festivals according to the customs, can substitute them with leaves, flowers, fruits and water \(*patram, puShpam, phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati - geeta*\) and worship with love to gain the fruits of the festival observance. If people do not understand this essence and think that preparing and consuming different prescribed foods are the only main part of the festivals, they will borrow money and finally end up in untold sufferings due to burden of loans. Some people even complain, “These rotten festivals have ruined me.” and earn the blemish of blaming sacred festivals, in addition to the sufferings mentioned earlier.

4\)For many people the festivals of our culture, has become a puzzle for various reasons and it has resulted in ridicule and incoherent opinions. The main issues of the puzzle are the number and variety of the festivals.

Scholars lecture, “We do not reject festivals of merriment. People of all countries have these festivals. But, in our land, every dawn ushers in a festival. There is not a day without a festival. They result in waste of time, money and productivity\! The desire to eat and adorn new clothes results in a lot of waste of money. Time is spent in idling. Demand for holidays increase. These festivals have become the reason for providing beds for the lazy people to sleep. Therefore there is an urgent need to restrict the number of festivals in the interest of the social and economic welfare of the society and the nation.”

There are thousands of gods. There are hundreds of festivals for them. People fight claiming one festival is more important than the other. For every festival, the scripture declares that it is the most superior of all the festivals and the rest of them do not even compare to one sixteenth of this festival, in merit. \(*vratanaamuttamaM vratam\! anyaani tu vrataanyasya lalaam naarhanti ShoDasheeM”*\). There is no answer to the question: Which festival's proclamation of the benefits are genuine?

“The fact that there is no unanimity about the specific dates for some of these festivals has resulted in division among people. The date for the New Year's Day \(*ugaadi*\) according to solar \(*saura maana*\) lunar \(*chandra maana*\) and Jupiter \(*Brahaspatya maana*\) calendars are different. Lack of a common date agreeable to all for festival days like *prathama ekaadashi, krishna aShTami, Sree jayanthi* and many other festivals cause arguments. In contrast, let us look at the systematic nature with which Christmas is celebrated. It is celebrated on the same day, every year in all the countries of the world”. Orderliness of date of Christmas and the disorderliness of our festival dates are of equal weight. Some of these criticisms and comparisons are the direct result of lack of understanding of the essence of the festivals of *bhaarateeyas*. Some of these variations are the result of the mutilated form of our festivals. In any case, these facts have created confusion in the community.

5\) Due to various notions described above, the mentality of mocking and deriding our festivals and holydays of our culture are on the rise, even among our own people. Proponents of opposing religious faiths are feeding fuel of their amity to this raging fire of disgust.

6\) On top of this, meaningless customs, that are contrary to the essence of rites of the righteous eternal order \(*satya sanaatana dharma*\), have raided our cultural life. Wearing various facial masks of modernism and fashion, these new customs have captured even the orthodox followers of our religion. We offer a specific example to illustrate this trend.

We address birthdays as addition of years, augmentation \(*vardhanti*\), that which brings victory \(*jayanti*\) and other words of progression. Our culture advises sighting and savoring auspicious things on such occasions. It is a special and propitious day, in praise of the new unfolding step in the evolution of the soul. But, birthdays are celebrated now-a-days by blessed folks, as an ordained rite of mounting as many candles as our age on a cake, lighting those candles and then blowing them off with our own breath, then cutting the cake in to pieces and distributing them to family and friends. How inauspicious is to follow this ritual, of turning off the lamp which is characteristically followed in the funeral rites, during the birthday celebration of a live person\! \(The practice, of ‘making the light big’ \(literally shutting off\) and then relighting it, is followed in our religious rites also. However, blowing the candle off is not in that group\). In the households who have the ability to practice the rites of a culture which, desires to avoid using the phrase ‘tuning off’ when it comes to lamp which indicates the Eternal Divine light and instead uses the phrase “to make the light big” as a derivative, what an inauspicious practice has taken foothold\!

The main reason, for the present dark day environment, is the cloud of ignorance that covers the bright Sun of our intellect, our lack of knowledge of the subject and our blind faith. In this situation, we feel a gale of scientific deliberation, as to what our festivals and holy days are, what are its special characteristics, what is prescribed in the scriptures, what are the procedures to follow, what are their usages, what is the arrangement of their timing, is essential to drive away the cloud of our ignorance and to shine light of the propitious day. In this exercise, we should not give room to obstinate stances that we have to prove that everything in our culture is somehow correct, or everything in other cultures is to be censured. Without viewing the subject matter with such colored glasses, we substantiate and propound the festival and holy days of bharateeyas following the majestic thought waves of our heroic preceptor, who proclaimed “Information, experiment, experience, is my entire scripture”. It is our desire that this deliberative mirror pertaining to an important aspect of our culture will aid in the reexamination and their apt performances.

We had avowed earlier that we will expound with praiseworthy proof that: the festivals and holidays graciously endowed by the great sages \(*aarya-maharshis*\) have many distinguishing features; they are replete with intellectual and scientific facts; they are based on the wisdom pertaining to the time embodiment of the divine; they grant the fourfold objectives of life \(*purusharthas : dharma, artha, kama and moksha*\) to those who practice with a good understanding \(of the festivals\). Traversing in the path of fulfilling that promise, firstly, we will examine the meaning of the terms used for festivals and holydays, the derivative words used to name the festivals and holidays, and the significance of their meanings, subsequently.

		
Our inquiry into the subject of various terms and names of the festivals and holy days, their meanings and their etymology, in order to illustrate credibility of our opinion about them as promised earlier, should not be viewed as semantic jugglery or infatuating doctrine based on the argument that they are not so important, even if they are relevant. If we study carefully the origin of the words, the literal and inferential \(implied\) meanings stemming from them, such a study becomes a systematic process of studying the culture and civilization. ***Sree Rangamahaaguru*** used to teach us that \`Intimate knowledge of a word concludes in the ‘intimate knowledge of the object of that word”. Modern scholar Dr, Earnest Klein says“ To know the origin of words is to know the cultural history of mankind” and further, he has observed its utility as “ In tracing the words of their origin, we are tracing simultaneously civilization and culture to their roots”

In addition, a critical examination of these words and their meanings will help in understanding the science behind the time, the process and the object of the festivals and holy days promulgated \(brought forth\) by the seers.

While we are discussing the words used to enunciate the names of festivals and holy days of *bhaarateeya* culture along with their meanings, it is necessary to examine the notions of festivals expressed by other well known cultures of the world, in different languages. This examination enables us to weigh the cultures, as well. So, let us take that subject first.

Festival, feast, festivities are the words used in the English language for these celebrations. Webster Dictionary defines festival as a day or time of religious or other celebration marked by feasting, ceremonies or other observations; A period or program of festive activities, cultural events or entertainment and gaiety, revelry, merrymaking in remembrance of a great event or in respect of a great person.

In old French the derivative of the word festival is ‘Feste’, and it is ‘Fete’ in modern French. In Spanish it is ‘Fiesta’, in German it is ‘Fest’ and Russians use the word ‘prazdnik’. All these words except prazdnik are derived from the Latin root ‘Festivus’.

These words mean: an occasion to celebrate happiness, joyous congregation with feasting, dancing and singing and a sectarian celebration.

In Arabic language the word ‘Id’ is used. It gives the meaning, it is a holy day, a day of rest from work, a day of happiness and a special Muslim festival. They use the word ‘Roza’ to refer to religious fasting. In European languages they use Fast, Faste, Fasten, Fastan, and Foestan and so on. These words convey the idea of total fasting.

The words, used in Chinese language for these occasions, ‘Chieh’ and ‘Yen hui’ also mean happiness, celebration and a day of rest.

Let us analyze some of the words for festivals and holy days used in languages influenced by the *bhaaratheeya culture*. We will discuss the prominent words used in Sanskrit language, which is primal force and the mother of many linguistic offshoots.

**1.Utsavah:** The cited etymology of this word is: that which produces happiness \(*utsoote harSham*\), that which impels wellbeing and dearness \(likeability\) \(utsavati, prerayati shreyase preyase wa\), an uplifting ritual \(*unnaayakaK yajnaH*\). \[note: the word uplifting has very special *yoga* significance. This implies upward path on the way to realization\]. This brings the notion of a celebratory form of worship with the characteristics of satisfying, nourishing, rejuvenating and uplifting \(involution\). Figuratively, any subject that bring pleasure to the eyes, ears and other sensory organs are also called utsava for example that which brings pleasure to eyes is netra-utsava and that for ears is *shravaNa utsava*.

**2.Maha:** Etymologists describe this as an activity time for worshipping gods. \(*mahyante devaH atra*\), an activity time fit for the performer to acquire venerability and spiritual illumination \(*mahyate poojyate tejo va praapnoti anena*\). Their intention is to state that these festivals are for worship of preceptor and divinity and which will yield the fruits coveted venerability and spiritual illumination.

**3.Uddhava:** It is an activity time for expelling delusion and pain. \(*uddhoonoti, duHKam moham ca*\).

**4.KShaNa:** \(*kShaNam kaala visheShe syaat parvaNya vasare mahe \(haima koSha\)*. It is an activity time to destroy attachment and delusion. \(*kShiNoti shoKam moham ca*\). An activity time to experience pleasure of the soul and experience joy which is not incompatible with righteous order \(dharma\), having dispelled attachment and delusion, is festival. Here, we can recant the sayings \(*tarati shokamaatmavitM*\) a realized person overcomes the \(bounds of\) afflictions and infatuations and *\(dharma viruddho bhooteshu kamosmi bharatarshabha*\), Oh, the best among the Baratha clan, desires which are not incompatible with the righteous order \(*dharma*\) is Myself, understand it as a pleasure that is agreeable to God, as quoted in upanishad and geeta respectively.

**5.Jayanti:** This word is used to refer to a birthday celebration of divine incarnations and great human beings. it is a day which propagates victory \[over evil\] and virtue \(*jayam puNyam ca tanute jayanteem tena taam viduH*\).

It is a celebratory occasion of the enlightening and majestic day which enables the practitioners, by providing incentives and the wealth of virtuosity, to be successful in their great pursuit of fulfilling the objectives of the human existence \(*purShArtha*\).

The explanation given above, clarifies the great benefits gained by proper practice of these festivals. We remember with reverence the following words of sree ranga mahaa guru, when he was giving a discourse on the celebration of the birth day \(*jayanthi*\) of great Spiritual guides \(*aachaarya*\). He taught us that “Whenever we experience the state of realization, the bliss, the immortality and the state of union with the divine, which was experienced by the spiritual guides, then all those occasions become the birthday celebration of the spiritual preceptors. During, certain auspicious lunar days \(tithi\) and auspicious asterisms \(*nakShatra*\) the nature possesses special qualities which can naturally carry a practitioner to such a state, those auspicious times can also be called the birthday of the spiritual guides.”

Technically, Supreme Spirit sree *krishNa's* birth day \(especially\) is also referred to as *jayanthi*. \(For example:\) The eighth day of the waning moon in the month of July or August together with *rOhiNi* constellation signifies *sree krishNa's* birth day \(*“rohiNee sahita shraavaNa maasasya krishNaasTami jayanthi” from Appayaa Dikshita's yaadavabhyudayaa vyaakhyai, shlo 1*\).

**6. janmamahaH: 7. janmOtsava** It is evident from their meaning that these terms are associated with the festival celebrating birth \(*janma*\).

**8. parva:** *‘parva’* means conjunction of times. Since it has the quality to protect and since it is complete, it derives the name ‘parva’ \(*piparti-iti parva, poo paalanapooraNayOH*\).

The eighth day \(aSTami\), fourteen day \(*caturdashi*\), fifteenth day \(full moon day, *poorNima*; new moon day, *amaavaasya*\), the sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another \(*saMkramaNa*\) are knows as the five parvas \(*panca parva*\). Apart from this, eclipse times are especially called *parva*. And, the conjunction times \(dawn, noon, dusk etc\) on full moon day, new moon day and the first day of the fortnight are also known as parva.

The primary meaning of the word parva is node, or a knot, or an important part of a plant, creeper and fingers and toes. Figuratively, it refers to conjoining point in time, a step or phase, a part of a treatise and so on. \(*‘ikShorograatya kramashaH yathaa parvaNi rasavishEshaH’* \(*subhashita*\) *‘Bhaarate cEkShudanDE ca pratiparva rasOdayaH’* \(*Bha. prashaMsaa*\) *‘sOpaana parvaaNi vimuMcadaMbhaH’* \(*raghuvamsha 16-46*\) *‘parva kleebam mahE granthau prastaave lakShaNantare darshapratipadoH sandhau vishwavatprabhritiShTapi\)*. Just as a node is an important and very beneficial part in plants, trees and vines, a festival or conjunction of time periods \(*parva*\) is an important and very beneficial part in the time bound body. Indigenous, regional languages which are directly influenced by *maharShi* culture talk about festivals as follows.

A festival is *‘habba’* in Kannada derivative of *‘parva’* in *samskRuta*. *‘parva’* transformed to *‘parba’* and from which transformed to *‘habba’* The meaning of this word has already been explained clearly.

In Telugu the word *‘panDuga’* is used for festival. In Tamil it is *‘panDikai’* and in Malayalam it is *panTika*. Pandu means to be fruitful. So, it is an opportune time for one's practice to bear fruit; *‘pandam’* means an object, It is a time for consuming objects for a specific purpose; *paNNika* means harnessing systematically; panti means a row, \(*pankti*\) or it is a day when friends and relatives sit in the same row and experience feast etc; all these are the derived meanings suggested for the words above. In any case it is a joyous day, a fruition day of our actions, a day of consuming enjoyable and emancipating materials. We recall the following message of *sree ranga mahaa guru,* on the occasion of a festival “on that day when we use and consume materials your mind should be filled with the object \(*panDa*\) of the Supreme Spirit \(*panDaa aatma viShayaah buddhiH, geeta, shankara bhaShya 5-18; panDithaH atmayathaatmya vidaH, geeta raamaanuja bhaShya - 11; paanDithyamaagamajnanam \(geeta madhwa bhaSya 5-18*\). If it is so, the festival \(*panDikai*\) is fruitful”

On festival days special foods like lentil soup, pudding, juices and many other special dishes and ingredients are prepared. These special foods should not have limited aim of satiation and culinary delight of the tongue, but, they should have the disposition of spiritual reverence, mentioned above, and a sense of bestowing the fruits the fourfold objectives of life \(*puruShArhta*\).

The word *ullsavam* in Malayalam is a corrupted form of utsavam in Sanskrit. The word visheSham is also borrowed from Sanskrit. These words convey that these are very auspicious times, and times that make substances distinct and times which bear superior fruits for practitioners.

The Tamil words *viLa, viLavu* indicate that it is a celebration which brings prosperity. The word tirunaaL proclaims that the time is auspicious and sacred.

*‘varShada hecchu’, varsha ‘vardhanti’* in Kannada also indicates prosperity. These words convey the meaning that it is a day to attain prosperity, a day for a new step in the evolution of the soul.

In classical Hindi, the word ‘thyohaar’ means a festival. This word is made up of two words *\`tithi'* \(lunar day\) and *‘vaara’* \(day of the week\). This word conveys clearly the meaning that the festivals are to be celebrated on a specified time and day and not on a time and day of our convenience.

The word *‘varShagaanT’* in Hindi means birthday. It is derived from the Sanskrit word *varSha-granthi. ‘granthi’* means a knot. It is in tune with the word *‘parva’*, referred to earlier.

Finally we will examine the meaning of the word *‘haridinam’*. It means the day of the Almighty, a very dear day of Lord naarayaNa. Its derived term is *‘harivaasaraH’*. \(*Sree harErdinam, haridinam, haripriyam vaasaram - harivaasaram iti vivRitiH.*\)

On the occasion of some of the festivals there are opportunities for the happiness and pleasure which do not conflict with righteous path . But *haridina* \(*harivaasara*\) is a day which is totally devoted to the worship of God. It is an auspicious and holy day, very dear to the Lord.

In a technical sense, the eleventh and twelfth day of the fortnight \(*Ekaadashi and dvaadashi*\) are also known as haridina. \(*“ekaadashi dvaadashi ca proktaa sreechakrapaaNinaH”* - *ubhayordevataa hariH*\). Lord *naarayaNa* is the presiding deity for both of these days. Therefore they are *haridina*.

It is also said that the term *haridina* refers only to the eleventh of the fortnight *\(Ekaadashi*\). *“tasminkasminschidaadye haridina tuLasee dwaadashibhiH prasaadye” \(haridinatilakam I;\)*. The first quarter of the twelfth day of the fortnight \(*dvaadashi*\) is also said to be the *hardiana*. \(*“dwaadashyaH prathamaH padaH harivaasarasamjnakaH”*

*Shivaratri* also comes under this category of holy days, as it is totally devoted to the worship of God. On that occasion the almighty is worshipped specially in the form of shiva, the worship services during the night is auspicious, it is indicated as *Shivaraatri. Ekaadashi* and *Shivaraatri* are called fasting festivals. On these days the soul is served the feast of bliss, although the stomach is hungry.

Other languages of *bhaaratha*, such as maraaTi, bengaali, gujaraathi and sindhi use either the above mentioned samskrita words or their derivatives of their own, to refer to these festivals.

In military circles when a high ranking official visits, there is the practice of arranging a grand feast in their honor. In such feasts excessive eating, drinking, singing and shouting, some speech and some gymnastics are the main feats carried out. In English such a grand occasion is called a feast. But in Hindi it is not called a feast \(tyohaar\), but it is called as a big meal \(*baDaakhana*\), conveying the activity literally. Our big salute to them for this distinguishing term\!

A close analysis of the terms used indicate festivals and holy days in the languages influenced by the bharateeya culture and the languages of other cultures, their derived forms and etymology, a few facts standout.

1. The fact that festivals are celebrations of happiness is accepted by both the bharateeya culture and other cultures. 
2. Both cultures agree that there are some festivals for showing respect and reverence for God or remembrance of saintly personalities. 
3. Both cultures accept that fasting is a part of the rites. 
4. There are a numerous derived terms to refer to the festivals in the languages of bharateeya culture. That wealth is comparatively less in the languages of other cultures. 
5. There are no separate words to distinguish the festivals and holy days in the languages of other cultures. 
6. Both the spiritual and material enjoyment aspects are integrated in *bharateeya* festivals. Even the fasting days are termed festivals \(fasting festival\) in this culture. The delight of the soul derived in *yoga* *‘samaadhi’* state \(in the state of absorption with the divine\) is regarded with utmost respect and is termed as the coveted supreme or divine bliss, serves as the proof \[of the fact both spiritual enjoyment with or without material enjoyment is termed festivals\]. In English and the languages of other cultures, fasting and feasting are contradictory terms and can not be used in singular sense. 
7. The terms which refer to various aspects of festivals in *bharateeya* culture signify their utility in absolving sin, accruing religious merit \(*punya*\) and attainment of the four fold objectives of life \(*purusharthas\)*. Such aspects are not found in any terms or words used for festivals and holy days in the languages of other cultures. 
8. Terms such as *‘parva’* \(festival time\) tyohaar which indicate that festivals should be celebrated on specific time and specific days decorate the *bharateeya* languages. The science of the time, *karma*, substances that come to light with these terms are magnificent. Such terms and the scientific significance of time etc are not found in other languages. 

It is appropriate here to describe the term *‘parva’*. It is most fitting that the term ‘knot’ \(*granthi*\), which connotes the nodal joints of plants, trees and vines, is used to indicate special confluence of time.

In bamboo plants and sugar canes, the knots governed by a \[biological\] rule, appear at regular intervals and in a determined quantity. In a similar fashion, in the time embodiment of the divine, the festival occurs at regular intervals, in determined numbers governed by a law. Protection of the plant's life force, nourishment, evolution and the leaves, branches, flowers necessary for bearing fruits originate from their nodes. In the same way, the protection, nourishment, enfoldment, and the avenues necessary to attain the four fold objectives of human life, which is dependent on time, specifically originate from the confluences of time. Nodes in plants are the storehouses of nature's gifts. In the same way, the knots in times, called festivals are the store houses of strength for renewed evolution of human beings.

This is the significance of these festivals. The great sages preached that the rituals performed during these festivals bring the wealth of their fruits in quick order. If so, many questions arise: Can these festivals be celebrated at different times? Do such \[untimely\] performances become less virile? Do we have to wait for such special festival time \(parva\) for God reminiscence? What do we do, if the person waiting do so passes away? What is time? Does it have form? Does it have limbs? Let us examine these questions and ponder over the classical investigation and analysis of time and actions \(*kaala-karma-meemaamsa*\), which provides the answers.

The rituals should be performed at the earliest possible time. There is no guarantee that the present good state of man's mind lasts in the next minute. It is said that good deeds face many obstacles \(*shrEyaamsi bahu vighnani*\). As the time is postponed obstacles may increase in number. Furthermore a person who plans to perform a rite, on a certain auspicious time and awaits such a time, might pass away. Our scriptural cannons \(*neeti shaastra, dharma shaastra*\) teach us to perform the religious rites at the earliest, as if the messenger of death has grabbed us by the hair \(*gRiheeta iva kesheshu mruthyunaa dharmamaacarEt*\).

Furthermore, there is no prescribed time for offering prayer to God. There is no defilement or impurity for offering prayers to God *“naashoucam keertanE tasya”*. There is no fixed time, place or direction for worshipping *“yatraikaagrata tatraavisheShaat”* \(*brahmasootra* 4.4.11\). In whatever land or whichever time facilitates concentration, that is where and when is the right time to worship, according to the realized. So, it is natural to object and ask ‘is it not silly to wait for an opportune auspicious or festival time \(parva\) to perform religious rites’? However, this is not a deep rooted objection. In prior discussions, it is only avowed that the rites performed at the prescribed time for the festival or holidays bear special fruits, but it does not prohibit performance of the rites at different times or suggest the auspicious time has to be awaited. It is better to perform the rites without delay.

But, those who are confident that they can perform the ritual now, as well as perform it in eight days, which is the stipulated time for the eighth day of fortnight \(*aShTami*\) celebration and further they are confident that their mind will not change during that time interval, may wait until the prescribed time. Those who lack such determination or lack facilities to celebrate at the prescribed time, have the freedom to celebrate it today. Those who do not lack the facilities, but, if they ask what guarantee is there that death will not consume them, no such guarantee can be given. But, the question, ‘what if death embraces them while they are making the determination to perform the rites instead of waiting eight days for the propitious time’, has to be asked.

If we were to say, ‘when one dies with a desire to do these sacred rites will get a chance to do it at least in his next birth’, then the same rule applies to one who dies while waiting for the auspicious time to perform the rites.

Now let us think about meditation on God and prayer \(*nimeShaardham na tiShtanti vRittim brahmamayeem vina* | *brahmaadyaa naaradadyasca sanakaadyaashyukaadayaH*\). Brahma and sages like *naarada* and *sanaka* never detach themselves from the meditative path \(*braahmeevRutti*\), even for half a minute. People who belong to this category need no special festival time for prayers and singing carols \(*sankeerthana*\). Why shouldn't those who do not have the ability for such uninterrupted contemplation, and those who are in the process of acquiring such contemplative ability, make use of the facility of auspicious festival times? By God's grace, if they acquire such power of concentration of the mind at other times, let them perform intense meditation at those times. From their vantage points those times are also auspicious times. The natural facility, that is available to all, at special times in the time embodiment of the divine, is called festival times \(*parva kaala*\). If, on these special and auspicious times mediation, carols, worship bear especial fruits in a short order, why shouldn't they be used for the benefit of the soul?

When one has all the facilities to perform a propitious rite today, as well as on the specified future day, it is always advisable to perform it on the specified day.

We recall the following advice given to us by *Sree Ranga mahaa guru*. “The divine, in the time embodiment form, has provided facilities at known auspicious time phases, known as festival times \(*parva*, for the deliverance of the souls. We shouldn't forego the use of these special times”

*Bharateeya* sages possessed amazing knowledge of the source and the science \(*jnaana-vijnaana*\) of the subject of time, such as, it's nature, form, quality, consequence and the benefits we can derive from it. This knowledge is also incorporated in the festivals which they have brought into practice. This fact becomes clearer, if we undertake a comparative view of the perception of time in different cultures.

What is Time? Does it exist or is it only a concept ? Normally, people do not ponder over these issues. But, all have the experience of time. All understand at least a little bit of the effect of time. People understand the daily morning, afternoon, evening, night time changes from a shorter duration to longer periods, at certain longitude and latitudes. \(At the north and south poles the days and nights stretch for months\). These durations are calculated by observation of the period of daylight, darkness, the distance at which the sun, the moon, the stars, appear in the skies. Depending on the changes caused by time in weather conditions such as cold, rain, heat, winter, the rainy, summer seasons are observed; by observing the changes in the body and the mind due to time, childhood, youth, old age are categorized; so also, with the aid of instruments, and knowledge obtained by perception. Second, minute, day, month and year of time period is measured.

In order to understand the nature of people's reaction to the time, we can observe they adapt themselves to extremes in weather, such as cold and heat, by wearing warm clothes or stay comfortable with artificially cooled air.

In order to understand what benefits people derive from divisions of time, we can observe they eat hot and spicy food in winter, they drink cooled juices in summer; work longer and harder in milder climate, and get salaries and bonuses paid at specified times etc. All these activities are related to pleasure of the physical and sensual body. As a result of time, if someone near and dear to us passes away, we express sympathy and say “poor thing, he got caught by sharp teeth of time” and forgetting the fact that we are also going to face the same fate sooner or later, we engage ourselves in the routine life. \(*ahanyahani bhootaani pravishanti yamaalayam| sheShaH sthavaramicchanti kimaascharyamataH param.” mahaabharatha yakShaprashna*\)

Western philosophers and scholars of even advancing physical sciences also do not say anything conclusively about the nature of time. They say, “Although very familiar to us, yet it is a subject full of mystery and riddle”. “Time, more than any other subject of philosophical concern, has been a perennial source of puzzlement and perplexity. It is ironic that something with which we are so intimately acquainted with, should give rise to paradoxes as soon as we attempt to scrutinize it analytically” \(The philosophy of Time, edited by Richard M. Gale, preface\) “It has no independent entity. It is the virtue of a quality of an object” is what Aristotle, Jeno, Augustine and many other philosophers say about time. “It has being only as an attribute of an attribute of substance.” “Time proves itself unreal, under the weight of analysis.”

Among the physicists, Isaac Newton opined that time has independent existence and it is not \(relative\) dependant on perception \(*bhavanaasapekSha*\). According to Einstein's theory, time is a relative object, not an independent and real object. Can one escape the power of time? Although not practicable, it is theoretically possible if one travels at the speed of light. To give an example, if out of the just born twins one stays on the earth, and the other is taken into space in a plane which flies at the speed of light, for seventy years and returned back to the earth, it is not aged at all. The child that remained on the earth will be 70 years old. This has to be explained by the scholars of physics.

What do scientists say about the use of time? They talk about the previously described material benefits, comfort and enjoyment for the senses. Other than these, they talk about the intellectual delight \(satisfaction\) due to the enquiry into the subject of time. They also talk about the application of the knowledge of time in scientific investigations. All these are also confined to the material plane.

With a review of this background, we will examine, the doctrine of time of *bharateeya* sages on the subject, and the nature of their experience of time. When we view it in this respect, we will observe that they have not refuted the subject matter discussed above. But, we can observe that their thought flow encompasses incredibly deep and broader areas.

The flood of time keeps us captivated and pushes us ever forward. We get a glimpse of the power of time, when we are rushing downstream, outwards facing. But, it is impossible in this state to know its nature and its origin. If we want to know these, we have to have the courage and the contemplative ability to go in the opposite direction, swimming upstream. The people, who achieved this great feat by rigorous meditative practice are bramha *JnAni RiSh-s* \(Seers who have the knowledge of the Creator\). When they entered into deep contemplation, restraining \(*samyama*\) their mind, the senses and their intellect, they had the audience \(*dharShana*\) of the effulgence of supreme spirit, the origin of all that is. They discovered that It was the origin of time as well. Not only did they personally experience the One without the limitation of time, action \(karma\), directions, sans forms, sans impurities \(pure -*niranjana*\), the great sea without motion, ocean of peace, blissful \(*amRuta*\), but they also realized that it is the absolute universal truth which can be experienced by all human beings. While nearing that contemplative state they saw a force, the embodied form of God, in deep contemplation and they perceived it to be a still, not orbiting \(*bhramaNa*\). They named that divine form *“su-darShana puruSha”* \(auspicious - audience person\), *su naabha* \(auspicious navel\), the origin of the wheel of time and they praised it as “To whom the Cosmic wheel as well as the everlasting wheel of time are subservient, to that divine person, *su-darShana*\) *“yadaayattam jagacakram, kaalacakram ca shaswatham”* \(*Shodashayudhastuti*\). While returning from that contemplative state to the world of nature, they witnessed that wheel's super natural motion, and they witnessed the majesty of that wheel controlling the whole universe, they discovered each and every stage of its formation and they preached their acquired knowledge to the whole world.

		
In their experience, time is the radiance or force \(tejas\) of the Supreme. *“kaalaatmEti samaakhyataam tejo maheshwaram param.” “tasyaaMshaMshamayee shaktiH kaalatmani mahaatmani*. \(*Shivapurana*. Chapter 6.6\). Although, as a force it is formless, it has a supernatural divine form visible to yogis. Its elemental form, can be described metaphorically as: He wears many nooses; He is majestic with armor and rings; He has pleasing disposition with six seasons. \(*“bahupaashadhaarah, Sreemaan kuNDaleekavacaanvitaH RutuShatkamayOdaaravaktraShatkasamanvitaH”*\).

The meaning of the term itself conveys its glory *“kalayati iti kaalah” kaalaH kaalayataamaham”* \(geeta Chapter 10\). Because it counts or measures, it is time. \(*kalaanaatsarvabhootanaam sa kaalaH parikeertitaH, viShNudharmottara*\). Every thing is created and so also everything is swallowed, by time \(*“kaalEnaiva ca srujyante sa eva grasatE punaH”*\). It is the glutton that swallows even the great godheads. It cooks everything \(*“kaalaH pacati bhootaani”*. But it's tricks does not work with the Almighty, because he as *mahaakaala* \(Supreme Time\) has measured even the one which measures everything \(*“aahaakalo mahaanaTah”*\). He is beyond the blemish of time. \(*“kaalam kaaala kaalaateetam kalitaasheSham kalodoShaGnam” govindaaShtaka.*\) He is the lord of the *‘sudarShana chakra’* which is regulator of the wheel of time. *“kaalah kaalakaraH prabhuH”* \(*koormapurana*. Ch. 15\),

\(*swaatma yonijJnaH kaalakRudguNi* \(*shiva puraaNa* Chap.6\) *“naivEshitum prabhurbhoomnaH”* \(*bhAgavata* Part 3-11\) *“shivasya tu vashe kaalaH, na kaalasya vashe shivaH.”* \(*shiva puraaNa* Chap -6\). Time is his body. It is his power. Since he is embodied and possesses the power, time works as subservient to him. But, as is his ever-present power it is the regulator of everything except him, it is called as the *“paramEshvara”. “aanadirESha bhagawaan kaalOnantO ajarO amaraH || sarvagatwaat swatantratwaat sarvaatmatwanmahEshwaraH”* \(*koorma* c25”\). No one can act against its order. *“yadalamghyamashEShasya sthaavarasya carasya ca | niyOga roopameeshasya balam vishwaniyaamakam”*. In its holistic form, it is everlasting. *“anaadi nidhanaH kaalah rudraH samkarShaNa smRutaH”* There is no conception without time. *“na sO asti pratyayO lOke yatra kaalo na bhaasatE”*. In its component view, the realized sages, described by categorizing it starting from a ‘supreme atom’ form to the ‘supreme substance’ form. That which has no smaller division than it is the ‘supreme atom’ \(*paramaaNu*\). That which has no greater form than it is the ‘supreme form’ \(*mahattatva*\). This is comprehended only be yogis. \(More details about this can be found in *bhaagavata* III - 11\).

Time is a fierce force that cooks and swallows everything \(* “kaalOsmi OkakShayakRut pravRuddhaH”*\). It is also referred to as decease \(*mRutyu*\) or god of death \(Thanatos, *yama*\). It is a wheel with thousands of blades that chops off everything. It is a black asp with venom of ignorance, that bites and kills everyone. It is a flood of time which carries away everything. It is an unconquerable tiger of time, with sharp canines. We find these above mentioned frightening portrayal of time in our scriptures.

		
However, within the terrifying body of time, the seers discovered that the Supreme Being has placed propitious centers for human being's welfare. When human beings make use of these centers in an appropriate manner, they become focused inward. During these times they are pulled toward their origin, with little or no effort. When they are so travelling inward, they get the audience of godheads from whose blessings the four fold objectives \(*dharma, artha, kaama, mOkSha*\) are especially attained. In addition to this, the seers found there are nodes in time itself, that can help one to get release from the hold of time and enjoy the supreme bliss of timeless state. People who make use of this facility are most fortunate, indeed. The seers called these nodes as *parva* \(festival\).

During these special junctures of time \(*parvas*\), the body also experiences transformation externally \(these changes cannot be perceived by gross minded people\) and internally. Due to these transformations, the rate of flow in the naadi \[pulses that indicate the three humours, *pitta vaata kapha*\] undergo changes . The seven constitutent elements of the body \(*sapta-dhaatu*\) undergo changes, in their quality. It will be clearly visible to the sensitive minds that the innate nature \[of a person\], comprising mind, intellect and senses etc, is also transformed. As proclaimed earlier, for the conscious ones who understand and utilize these transformations, it brings bountifully auspicious results, in a very short time. “So, mark those festival times \(*parva*\), don't neglect them, don't waste them. If they are lost they don't come back when we desire them. We have to wait for their next occurrence. “Sail with the wind”, “don't close your eyes when the \[medicinal oil is offered” with these forewarnings, the kind hearted seers showed us the excellent utility of the festival times. They praised this means, for deliverance of the soul and the betterment of the world, as the charming and propitious portals and named them as festivals \(*parva*\) and showed us the precept and method of practice of these rituals. Offering our gratitude to the seers, we have performed the worship, with this brief exposition, of our preceptor, who is the embodiment of time, beyond the bounds of time and who mastered the science of time.

Time \(*kaala*\) is the wonderful and invisible force of the Supreme Spirit. Its play does not touch the Supreme Being and the emancipated souls in His shelter. Time chases everyone else wherever they go and plays with them. Without a tiny bit of compassion, it devours them in its fangs, and swallows them like a black cobra that devours frogs. However, even in this formidable embodiment of time, merciful God has placed centers which help human beings to prosper. They are the festivals and holy days handed down to us, in our culture and custom, by the great sages of *bhaarata*. Those who understand the significance of these occasions, and use them are indeed blessed.

*“martyo mRityuvyaalabheetaH palaayan lokaansarvan nirbhayaM naadhyagacchat | twatpaadabdhaM praapya yadRicchayaadya swasthaH shEtE mRityurasmaadapReiti”*\(*bhaagavatha* X - 3 - 27\)

Next, we will take up the main objections about the festivals and holy days, that have preoccupied our minds, for discussion. If we reconcile these doubts, it will help us clearly grasp the topics in the future sections of this work.

The first objection is that Hindus have too many festivals. Whenever a person is faced with a series of troubles, this fact is published highlighting the grandeur of simile as ‘problems and poverty besieged them as the Hindu festivals do’. They express the opinion that the abundance in the number of festivals results in excessive waste of money, waste of substances, waste of time and waste of energy.

In order to solve this problem, they prescribe the solution ‘let them reduce the number of festivals; just like other religions, let them celebrate four or five festivals during a year; let them celebrate them on a grandeur scale; so, without much effort, merit and the fourfold objectives of life are attained.

Apart from the above objections, they continue, ‘why follow the dogma of observing the festivals in their order, one after the other, we have to have the independence to select their order to suit our convenience. For example, let us follow, *Shivaraatri* right after *Ugaadi*. This way the effect of the sumptuous meal of the first day is remedied by fasting of the next day, and it is good for health. It is not good to declare public holiday separately for each festival. It comes in the way of other important worldly affairs’. There are some folks, who race their intelligence, and suggest, ‘we can celebrate the festivals on days which are declared holidays for other reasons’.

We can say, the very meaning of the term *‘parva’* \(festival\), proclaimed by *bharateeya* sages are not understood by those who argue these points.

If these festivals were occasions meant only for eating, drinking, dancing, playing, and chatting, we could have increased or reduced the number of festivals to suit our monetary, leisure, and health conveniences. We could have celebrated them on days of our liking. But, as we have already observed, the festivals as taught by the realized, are the nodes and centers of power in the time embodied form of the Divine. Their numbers and their order, also, follow the rule as conceived by the omnipotent God, the regulator of time. It is not possible or desirable to reduce their number or their order. For example, the rule of how many nodes are to be, which node follows which node, in a sugarcane plant, is determined by its variety and its growth, by mother nature. Such a change is as undesirable as the degree of impossibility of effecting its change. The reason being, according to botanists, each knot in a sugar cane is the seed substance for the birth of a new plant. If there are more nodes they will be helpful in increasing sugar cane plant population, by planting and nurturing all of the nodes, at a proper stage of the plant's growth. Whether we observe them or not, or use them or not, a certain number of nodes, in a given order will be there in them according to a law of nature. The same law applies to the festival time nodes, in the tree of time. In a gross manner, everyone can observe that morning, noon, afternoon, evening and night occur, in order. We do not wish to change their order, although we observe them. We make use of them for our physical benefits. We have to understand the festivals nodes, which can be observed in a subtle view, in the same way and make use of them. The wise way is to utilize them for plane related to deities \(*aadhidaivika*\) and spiritual plane \(*aadhyaatmika*\) and not limiting them only to the material plane \(*aadhibhoutika\)*. There is an adage which says “New moon \(*amaavaasya*\) does not wait till the big brother arrives”. Likewise, festivals do not occur, when we wish. We have to make use of them as and when they happen. On such occasions, our senses and mind will be naturally focused inward. If we practice the rites during those times sincerely and enthusiastically, the journey in the inward kingdom progresses at a fast pace. This is the gracious gift of Mother Nature or Supreme Spirit, for our wellbeing. Therefore, the desire for reduction in their number is not a propitious wish.

On account of certain special reasons, it is said that on some festivals, special foods and dishes are dearer to the deities. Those who can afford may prepare such dishes, offer it to the deities and partake the foods as their gifts \(*prasaada*\). For example, for *gaNapati* festival special sweet dish ‘modaka, for *hayagreeva* festival, special lentil \(split chickpeas\) dish are said to be propitious in the scriptures. But, these dishes are not the main aspects of these festivals. Those who cannot afford it, need not stop the worship services on that account. They should offer whatever food is available and consume it, as if it is gift of the Gods. *“yadannaH puruShO bhavati tadannastasya dEvataaH”* \(*vaalmiki raamayana, ayodhya khaanda*\).

As the Lord said in bhagavad geeta, without any obligation to anyone, using whatever is readily available in nature, like leaves, flowers, fruits and water the festival performance can be accomplished. Those who cannot get even these substances can perform the worship services with the five elements \(*pancha-bhoota*\) of their body as five offering to the Super Spirit. As ordained in *Shivananda Lahari* mental worship can be performed \(*“shraddhaanadeevimalacittajalabhiShEkaiH nityam samaadhi- kusumaira punarbhavaaya”*, *“samarpairkyaM cEtassarasijamumaanatha bhavatE”-shivananda lahari*\). For whatever reason, we need not stop the performance of the festival due to lack of money and substances and so also, we need not engage in blaming \[of festivals\].

Since great benefits are derived during the festival times from the meditation and other worship of even a short duration, spending money, substance, time and energy for them become a means of earning high \(supreme\) profits *“sakala pruShaarthasaadhanaM sukha sampaadhyam alpaprayaasam analpaphalaM.”* \(*viShnusaharanaama bhaaShya of shankaraachaarya, shlOka 1*\). It is unintelligent to think of these as unnecessary waste.

The argument which states there is no time available for other important tasks, because plenty of time is spent in the performance of various festivals, is also not correct. Because, there is no rule that states every one has to observe everyone of the festivals. As described above, affairs of the state have to be organized wisely so that there is time allocated to celebrate festivals. Until the wisdom to facilitate such times for festival observance sets in people, the festivals should be observed at available times, without hindering the affairs of the state.

There is no end to the number of divinities worshipped during these festivals. Among the devotees the fire of hatred is on the rise due to arguments that the deity they worship is superior, all other divinities are inferior. Every rite states, when recalling its benefits, that it is superior and derides all other rites as inferior to it. Let us take up the discussion of the suggestion, ‘let Hindus worship one God and let the worship method be the same’, based on the facts observed above and predicting these divisive factors cause fights and friction among people.

There should be peace of mind for performing any rites and worshiping any divinity. There should not be any passion or enmity. The fruits of worshiping are, also, peace and contentment. So, there is no doubt that it is highly foolish for worshippers to fight among themselves. However, It is similarly foolish to argue that the divine form and the worship methods be the same, only then there is unanimity and equality; because these rites that are practiced conform to practitioner's preference, desire, level of spiritual progress.

We recall the teachings of ***Sree RangamahaaGuru*** : “It is foolish to argue that all patients irrespective of their different diseases should take the same medicine and in the same quantity, only then there is equality. Let there be equality in the desire that all patients regain their health, with medicine.”

Our scriptures describe vividly that even if various divine forms are worshipped in the field of actions \(*karma khaanDa*\), their root is the same in the spiritual view. *“Ekam sadvipraa bahudhaa vadanti”, “yO devaanaam naamadhaa Eka Eva”, “Ekassanbahudhaa vicaaraH”* \(Rigveda\). For examples, we can recall from *manusmRuti “EthamEkE vadantagnim manumanyE prajaapatim* and the commnetary by etymologists \(*niruktakaaras*\) *“Ekaiva devatha mahaabhaagyaat bahudhaa stooyatE”*. If we view from a philosophical angle that there is one and only one indwelling Supreme Spirit, there is no subject for infights.

If that is so, why do the compendium of rituals \(*pooja-kalpa*\) praise “Only this form is the Supreme God”. This is because their objective is to help the performer to have a teady and undivided devotion to that particular deity.

*“saamanyamEShaam prathamaavaratvam”* As the poet laureate kaaLidaasa says, due to the distinction of the place, the distinction of day, the distinction of the form of worship, this glory of being the Supreme God, may be afforded to all forms of divinity. The intention is in the importance of ISTadEvata and not in derision of other deities. “The God in question, alone, is present in the mind of the singer. With Him; for the time being, is associated everything that can be said of a divine being. He is the highest, the only god; before whom all others disappear, there being in this however, no offence or depreciation of any other god.” \(Koegi, P. 33\)

“Which is the main and most important part of a coconut tree.? Is it root? Is it the trunk? Is it leaves? Is it the bunch of flowers? Is it the husk? Is it the shell? or Is it the kernel inside? According to the time period, circumstances, and utility any of these parts can become the main part. The common part is ‘coconut’. It is the innate essence for all of these parts. So, also are the Creator \(*parabrahma*\) and the rest of the divinities”. We recall the occasion *Sree Ranga Mahaa Guru* taught us this essence, using the simple example above.

In *bhaaratha* land, Hindus celebrate the same festival on different dates in different parts of the country. Also, different sects celebrate the festivals on different days. This scattered practice is very unscientific. Apart from that, it leads to divisiveness and mutual distrust among people. \(We can provide contrary example that in the festivals of other religions we do not see this kind of diversity and the resultant difference of opinion or hatred\). For example, Lord *Krishna's* day of incarnation is called *janmaaShTami* by some and they celebrate it on a particular day. They consider that the eighth day of lunar fortnight \(*aShTami*\) is important. Some others call that day as *‘Sree Krishna Jayanti*, and celebrate it on a different day. They consider lunar asterism *rOhiNi* \(*nakshatra*\) as the important factor. Why has this difference cropped up? Did the Lord incarnate on two days? In the same way, the new year day \(*ugaadi*\) is celebrated on the first day of caitra month \(Spring Equinox\), in certain parts. Some others observe it on winter solstice \(*mESha sankramaNa*\). *Ekadashi* \(eleventh day of the lunar fortnight\) is observed on different days. These differences create disunity in the society. In order to avoid such rifts, some suggest that all Hindus, wherever they are in the world, should celebrate each festival on the same day.

Some others argue that it is better to celebrate the same festival on different days in different households; so that the families can visit each other's house and partake in the celebration; Both can enjoy the dishes prepared in each of the houses; Mutual friendship and harmony grows as a result of this; “The best way to heart is through stomach”.

Without viewing these objections from an emotional angle, we should take them up in a logical sense and render our opinion. In that opinion, there should not be any attachment or prejudice *“abhinivEshavasheekRitacEtasaam bahuvidhaamapi sambhavati bhramaH” \(Agama praamaaNya. Shloka. 3*\)”

If these differences are caused by prejudice or attachment or out of rivalry, they must necessarily be rejected. It is a well known truth that the sunrise, sunset does not occur at the same time in all places on the globe \(Let alone the globe, even in different parts within a country\). Planets and stars do not cast their influence on all places at the same time. There is no rule that says they affect all the practitioners in a similar fashion. Among the practitioners, some may only have emancipation as their goal. Some others may perform rituals to fulfill desires \(dharma, artha\). ‘A measure of time from one winter solstice to the next winter solstice, is called a solar year. A measure of time from one new moon to the next new moon is called lunar month \(*chandramaana*\). These two measurements of time may suit different people in different parts of the country for different purposes. Observance of a rite in a lunar day \(tithi\) with or with out *‘vEdha’* \[The term means protrusion of one *‘tithi’* into another\] may be different in accordance with the difference of the desired results. If this is the credible reason, it is logical for people to celebrate a particular festival on different days, in different places.

But they should not quarrel with each other on account of this. Patients may consume different medicines depending on the nature of their ailments. But for this reason there should be no ill feelings among them. Let people observe festivals on the scientifically determined day, to fit their intended purpose. There should be reverence and appropriate cooperation, if some others practice it on a different day for the same reason. In our view, there is both the wisdom and amity in this type of action.

Similarly, at times while accenting the glory of a particular rite and the inferiority of other rites are stressed. The aim of this \[comparison\] is to induce a firm resolve in the performer for the particular rite. There is no desire to deride other rites. This method is formally named *‘artha vaada’* \[‘Explanatory Remark or a sentence which conveys the praise or glorification of a thing enjoined or the censure of others\] \(*“nahi nindaa nindyam ninditum pravartatE, apitu nindyaaditarat prashaMsitum” \(Agama pramaaNya pp 4 - 45*\). However, this should not give room to incoherent arguments.

We have reconciled some of the main objections that are caused by misconception about bharateeya festivals and holy days. Distinct and special topics of these festivals are to be learnt by approaching those great souls, who have gained the knowledge and science of the Supreme being to their satisfaction, with reverence and offering them service and asking questions. We are pleased if these discussions have helped calming some notion which have raided our intellect, resulting from information that are contrary to our culture's festivals and holy days.

Festivals are one of the life's most savory occasions. Life's journey, lacking their knowledge and not practicing them, is like a voyage in the desert without oasis. “It is common experience that ‘Human life without festivals is oppressively monotonous and tortuous. It is a journey in a desert-land devoid of any oasis”. This subject is the common experience of all people. Therefore, forgetting all bitter situations of life, mingling with near and dear friends to enjoy the delightful and not so delightful moments to the extent possible, the custom of celebrating at least a few festivals are found among all peoples of the world. We have observed that among these festivals there are many special praise worthy aspects in the festivals and holy days of the culture of the great sages \(*maharShi*\). Now, we have to take a few important festivals and holy days as examples, and distinguish these aspects.

While we study the various festivals we have to bear in mind some of the related significant facts When we do so, it becomes easy to categorize them and study individual festivals and holy days. For performing any religious festival or holy day \(*parva*\), our mind should be in good humor.

The three instruments \(mind, speech and the body\) should be pure \(*trikarana shuddhi*\). All the senses should be restrained. The virtues of the soul should be abundant. In accordance with the rites either fasting or subsisting on wholesome bland diet \(*saatvika*\) should be observed. The lunar day \(*tithi*\),day of the week \(*vaara*\), and the asterism \(*nakShatra*\) should be pronounced and with the requisite resolve \(*sankalpa*\) the rite should be performed.

The performance should consist of meditation \(*dhyaana*\), rosary \(*japa*\), fire offerings \(*homa*\) and worship \(*pooja*\). If one does not have the facilities to all these external worship, at least mental worship \(*maanasa pooja*\) should be performed. Devoid of stinginess, false pride and arrogance, charity should be practiced. When giving charity, things that are good and useful should be gifted. It is good practice to gift the items prescribed for a particular festival. They should be only given to the needy and deserving such as mendicants, families, the poor and invalids.

*“kShama satyam dayaa daanam shoucamindriya nigrahaH |*  
*dEvapoojaagnihavanam santOShostEyamEva ca |*  
*sarvavRatEShwayam dharmaH saamaanyO dashadha smRuthaH* || *\(agnipuraaNa 175-10-11\)* 

*“japO hOmascha saamaanavRitaantE daanamEva ca* |  
*brahmacaryam tathaa shoucam satyamaamiShavarjanam”* || *\(agnipuraaNa 174-10\)* 

*"vRatEShvEtaani catvaari variShTaaneeti niscayah* |  
*bhOjanE tu haviShyaannam saamaanyata udaahrRutam* *\(naaradeeya" \(110-48.\)\)* 

These great sayings of sages above support this view. Festivals practiced without these attributes become the festivals of demons or animals.

When there is impurity \(*ashouca*\) \[10 days after the birth or death of a family member, monthly periods\] no festivals should be celebrated. If such event occurs while a rite is being observed, that rite should be continued with the purity of mind or get it completed by a competent person. A religious rite should not be discontinued in the middle, after taking a firm resolve to carry it out. Even if the person passes away in the middle of the rite he accrues the full benefits of its conclusion.

*“yO yadartham carEddharmaM asamaapya mRuto yadi |*  
*sa tatpuNyaphalaM prEtya praapnOti manurabraveet” ||* 

Commonly, religious stories are associated with rites. Without criticizing them from historical or literary perspective, the principles contained therein have to be valued. Excessive hyperbolic accounts \(*atishayOkti*\) of the benefits are seen at times. The intention here is only to create deep interest in the celebration of the rite. We have to take it with wisdom as sensational benefits \(*“rocaanaartha phalashrutihiH”*\)

In this work, the term *‘vrata’* \(rite\) is used along with festivals and holydays as their derivative. Some people think vrata is different from festival. For example they say ‘we celebrate *shivarathri* festival not *vrata*’. *‘vrata’* means fasting, and puritanical cleanliness and other rules. Festival means eating satiating meals, according to them. But even in festivals there should be discipline, following certain procedures prescribed by religious canons. There are requirements of fasting or consumption of lighter food untill the completion of the ritual. These are also *vratas*.

For this very reason there is the custom of referring to sree *Siddhivinaayaka vrata* as *vinaayaka* festival, *ananthapadmanaabha vrata* is as *anantha padmanaabha* festival. *Sree Krishna Jayanthi* is both a festival and a *vrata*.

The attribute of the term *‘vrata’*, as described in the scriptures, \(that which conforms to the Divine law, which is scientific and which protects those who practice them\) is canonical law. It is in the form of penance \(*tapas*\) and it purifies us spiritually. It makes the attainment of the fourfold objectives of life \(puruShaartha\) possible. We may experience difficulties while performing, but it becomes bearable with practice. \(*“abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tannirOdah” patanjala yOgasootra, “abhayaasEna tu kauntEya, vairaagyENa ca gRuhyatE” geeta*\). All the difficulties are resolved upon fruition, and a newer variety of enthusiasm ensues and pleasure of the highest order \(bliss\) is obtained. *“klEshaH phalEna hi punarnavataam vidhattE”-kumarasambhava - 5*, *“shastrOdito hi niyamaH vratam taccha tapO matam.”* Every festival has its rules and regulations to enable these. For examples, the rules of commission such as worship God, give gifts to the deserving, and also, the rule of omission such as, do not resort to bad thoughts, do not speak foul language, there should be no stinginess, are common to all festivals.

But customarily, if fasting, chanting, technical methods, sacrificial offerings and ceremonies are prominent, the rite is called vrata and when such religious injunctions are not very many, and after the worship if the consumption of foods, sweets and juices as divine grace are permitted, such a rite is called a festival.

On the same day, in the same house on such an occasion, it can be a vrata to some and a festival to some others. For example the occasion of upaakarma ceremony, to those who are initiated to the *vEdas*, or those who perform *Rishi pooja* and those who perform offerings to elders who have passed away \(*tarpana*\), it is a day vrata. Such people should fast at least until noon or during the night. But to the others, it is a festival.

### Classification

Festivals can be classified from different angles.

1. Those festivals which are observed based on a specific lunar day \(*tithi*\), day of the week, \(*vaara*\) and asterism \(*nakShatra*\), can be divided as *tithi-vrata, vara-vrata, nakshatra-vrata, divasa-vrata* and so on. For example *kaarthika prathame, chaitra prathame* or *maargashira prathame* are classified as *prathama-tithi vratas. shravaNa dvaadashi*, *shayana dvaadashi, utthaana dvaadashi* these are *dvaadashi vratas*. *shravaNa shanivaara, kaarthika sOmavaara*, are *vara-vratas. punarvasu vrata, dhenu vrata*, are *nakshatra vratas*. The term *chaitravishu* indicate that it falls on the auspicious equinox day \(*vishuvat*\) in the month of *chaitra. aavaNee aviTTam* \(*yajur vEda upaakarma*\) indicates that the *vrata* takes place on *shraviShTe* of the month of *shraavaNa. samkranti, amaavasya poorNima* and other parvas are ever present in the flow of time and cast their influence on all. 
2. Festivals and vratas are classified based on the main deity of worship on the festival day. For example, *utthaanadvadashi, shravaNa-shanivara, Ekaadashi* are *vaishNava vratas.* *mahaashivarathri, kAarthika sOmavaara* are *shaiva vratas*. *Mangala Gauri, Svarna gauri, varamahaalaxmi* and many others are *dEvi vratas*. Although these vratas pertain to the worship of specified gods or goddesses, they are propitious occasions for mediation and worship to all spiritual seekers. 
3. *kaamya, nithya* and *nithya-kamobhaya-vratas* such as *santaana saptami, avidhavaanavami* come under *kaamya*. \(based on specific desire\). *Ekaadashi, amaavasya* are *nithya vratas*. *Mahaashivarathri* and *nRusimhajayanthi* are both *nithya* and *kamya*. If one performs *nithya* *vratas* with specific desire, they become *kaamya vratas*. 
4.   
	+ Festivals that can be celebrated by all, are *satyanarayaNa vrata, shivaraathri* and *krishNajayanthi*. 
	+ Similar to the rule that certain medicines are taken only by certain people, there are vratas which only some select people should perform. *Upaakarma* and *Vedavrata* rites come under this class. 

5.   
	+ *Ekadainika vrata*. \(One day festivals\) *Ugadi* and s*Ankraanthi* fall under this class. 
	+ *anEkadainika vrata* \(Festivals celebrated for a specified number of days\) *navarathra paarayaNa, saptaaha vrata* belong to this class. 

6. *Vratas* can also be categorized as *Maanasika, Vaacika,*Kaayika and so on. 
7. Festivals in the form of birthday celebrations:  
	+ God's incarnation days: *Raama Navami, Krushna Ashtami*. These festivals influence all those who worship *brahman* and *dharma*. If the preceptor \(*aachaarya*\) happens to be an incarnation of God, this rule applies to their *jayanti* also. 
	+ Birth anniversary of great men: Such celebrations inspire those who have special regard for them. 


Such great people's birthday is called *vardhanti* when they are alive and *jayanthi*when they are no more.

The birthdays of all others - It is a sacred day for the particular individuals. These are termed as *vardhanti*.

With this necessary background we can start studying, in detail, some special festivals. We will elaborate in a chronological order beginning with the first month of the year, incorporating any special features in the description of festivals \(*parvas*\).








	 
### Publisher's Preface

We offer our endless pranams \(obeisances\) at the holy lotus feet of ***SriSriRangapriya Sri Srih*,** the supreme Yogi, who was blessed by the grace of ***Sri SriRangamahaguru*.** H.H. the Swamiji was the president of *Bharata Darshana*, and is the author of this book.

By the grace of the kindly Lord, and the benevolent glance of the merciful Sadguru, and by the good wishes of the learned and good hearted persons, we are offering this book “Yogic And Vedic Heritage - FESTIVALS OF BHARATA” at the holy feet of God, and we are placing it as a sacred prasada in the hands of our dear readers.

Today, even though we celebrate many festivals that were graced to us by the enlightened persons \(Jnanis\), we are not observing them with the due knowledge of the spiritual science behind them. While some people are observing them with apathetic belief, some are observing them with half hearted trust, and also with indifference. Many people hit by hardships, poverty and want of time, observe the festivals with weariness, and curse the very arrival of these festivals and feasts. We are not being properly enlightened in this regard. At the same time, propagandists of Anarya Samskriti \(unrefined culture\), who are proliferating like the progeny of the demon ‘Rakta beejasura’, and armed with their practices, theories and activities, have been invading our culture and virtuous conducts. We have lost our discernment and also our pride, and so we are being subjected to scorn as a result of blind imitations. Let us explain this by an example:

The celebration of a birthday as per virtuous Bharatiya traditions include taking an oil bath and wearing of new clothes, lighting a lamp in front of God, offering obeisance to Teachers \(Gurus\) and elders, and seeking their blessings for health, prosperity, success, peace, contentment, good nourishment, and abundant growth, consuming prasada which consists of six different dishes, keeping away from either scolding others or getting abused by them, dwelling in auspicious thoughts, and drawing out a plan with family and friends happily for brightness and prosperity. But, due to the influence of the alien culture, a new custom \(of celebrating birthdays\) has made an entry in our country, even into the households of orthodox and tradition respecting people.

In this, cakes numbering the age of the person whose birthday is being celebrated are cut, and an equal number of lighted candles are put out. Nobody questions this. If at all anyone were to question this, the answer would be—“The cake, and the drinks taken along are the flesh and blood of Jesus. The number of lamps put out stand for the number of years completed by the person so far, and it is a symbol of the vow—‘Let us lead a good life at least in future’.—This is the new custom.

It is a disgrace that followers of Sanatana Arya Bharateeya Samskruthi are into accepting this custom and its observance, like copy cats. Because, on a birthday, one is supposed to consume prasada \(consecrated food\) offered to God, and not the flesh and blood of a great soul who was crucified by inconsiderate people who lacked judgment. The auspicious thoughts on that day should be about long life, and making a sacred vow ’—*Tanme manasshivasankalpamastu’*, and not the remembrance of the past days of bad *Vasanās* \(impressions of good or bad actions\)

The act of putting out the light \(in the candle\) is a custom which is indeed most inauspicious and an unwished one. In the homes of the virtuous and tradition respecting people, no one would utter the words—“Blow out the lamps’. Instead one would only say—“increase the light of the lamp”. \(In Hindi they say ‘Deepak badhavo’ and not Deepak bazaavo’\) If the lamp is extinguished, light vanishes and darkness sets in. We generally pray God to lead us towards light from darkness—*‘Tamaso ma jyotirgamaya’* and not *‘Jyotishah Tamo gamaya’* \(lead me towards darkness from light\).

In the above custom of the aliens, only the part of drawing out a good plan \(for the year\) is O.K. But the rest is all inauspicious. Why should Sanatana Arya Bharateeyas give up the custom of worshipping the auspicious deities and embrace the opposite of it?

This scared book is an attempt to set right to the extent possible, these erors related to the festivals and feasts, which have crept in because of lack of wisdom, laziness and lack of pride. The essays \(articles\) here scientifically explain the division of festivals, their common true form, necessity, importance, analysis, the proper and improper forms, the time of celebration, the materials needed, the method of observance, the benefits, and other such important matters. The Bharateeya festivals are not modes of forms of any blind tradition. They have a sound scientific background. The articles here indeed convince the virtuous who are free from prejudice, that the festivals have the potential to bestow the four-fold values of life i.e. Dharma \(virtuous conduct\), Artha \(prosperity\), Kama \(Desires or enjoyment not opposed to Dharma\) and Moksha \(Liberation-Emancipation\).

In the description of these festivals, a discerning explanation of the deities that are worshipped on the respective days \(of festivals\) is given. Some may feel that the explanations are very elaborate. But, many people at many places are falling preys to wicked propaganda about our deities, through the internet, print media and lectures, and thus we see a decline in devotion and faith towards our deities. Also, we have been noticing every day that enthusiasm is waning in matters of observance of festivals, in which those deities are worshipped. So, feeling the need for a scientific enquiry and discernment, we have utilized a good part of this book, with an aim to set right such wrong notions.

In this book we have reverentially used some words such as ***Sri Gurudeva*** \(Holy Teacher\), ***Maha Guru*** \(Great Teacher\). etc. The divine person thus referred to was one who bore the auspicious name ***‘Srirangamahaguru’***. He was noble person, a supreme Yogi, and a great soul satiated with divine knowledge and divine science. He hailed from a sacred place called ‘Hedathale’ near the pilgrim center ‘Nanjanagudu’, near Mysore. He was a supreme preceptor who spiritually educated hundreds of blessed souls about Bharateeya Samskruti in a scientific way.

Revered Sri Sampath Krishna Desikachar \(younger brother of His Holiness the Swamiji in his previous stage of life\) is a fatherly figure and an elderly person. He has special admiration and affection for Bharatha Darshana Publications. He has kindly graced all our endeavors and has been guiding us.

Prof. Sri.K.S.Sridharan, a scholar in Sanskrit and Kannada is an amiable and an accomplished person. He was a student of His Holiness in the degree and postgraduate classes, and had the fortune of receiving the blessings and guidance of the venerable Swamiji in various aspects for over four decades. At our behest he undertook the difficult task of translating this book into English from the original in Kannada penned by His Holiness and has excellently brought forth the essence of Swamiji's words in this translation. Working hard for several months, he has completed this sacred task as a form of service to God. We are grateful to him for his invaluable and praiseworthy service done with great devotion and commitment.

Dr.Hungi Papanna Eswara a neurologist by profession has worked in many Hospitals in the US. He was specially blessed by the grace of His Holiness. To serve His Holiness personally and to obtain guidance in spiritual life under his supervision, he quit his profession in the U.S. and returned to Bangalore . He served His Holiness for twelve years with full devotion. To bring this English translation to the present form from the summarised form, he has worked hard to incorporate all the points, and has provided invaluable inputs. We are grateful to him for his commendable work.

Sri Viswanatha sharma, a long time resident of USA, worked as a consultant electronics engineer for several prominent companies there. He has great respect for Bharatheeya Culture. He is an Initiate in ‘Kriya Yoga’, and has practiced it for several years. He has studied the works of Sriranga Mahaguru and the revered Swamiji. He has translated the introductory and concluding chapters of this book into English. We are grateful to him for the same.

Prof. Sri. T.N. Prabhakar is a Sanskrit scholar, and retired as Additional Director in the Directorate of collegiate education, Karnataka. At present he is the editor for Bharatha Darshana publications. He has edited the Sanskrit slokas in this book. We are grateful to him.

Professor, G.S. Mudambadithaya is a retired Deputy Director of Public instruction in the department of Education, Karnataka. He has provided a summarised English translation of the original work. We are grateful to him for the same.

Srimathi Roopa Madhwapathy a post graduate in English, teaches English literature and also has been writing lessons at Cogswell Polytechnical College in California, USA. She has assisted in editing some chapters in the book. We are grateful to her for the same.

Our endless salutations to Ashtanga Yoga Vijnanana Mandiram and many individuals, who have cooperated directly and indirectly in the publication of this book.

## Akshaya Tṛtīyā

Many *vratas* coming in the month of *Vaiśākha* such as *Vishuvatīparva*, *Mādhava prārambhotsava, Amāvrata, Tretāyugotpatti, CandradarsanaVrata, AkshayaTṛtīya, Paraśurāmajayantī*, *Śrī Śaṅkarācārya’s Śrījayantī, ŚrīRāmānujācārya’s Tirunakshatra, GaṅgāsaptamīVrata, MohinīVrata, NṛsimhaJayantī, PaurṇimāVrata, KūrmaJayantī*, *Vaiśakhasnāna Vrata* etc., are prescribed for observance. We shall discuss only a few of them which are important from the above view points.

### Importance of this Parva:

*Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is considered as one of the most important festivals celebrated in the month of *Vaiśākha*.

There is a reference to this *parva* in the *Bhavishya Purāṇa* where Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* himself has described the extraordinary greatness of this *Vrata* thus:-

बहुनात्र किमुक्तेन किं बह्वक्षरमालया ।  
> वैशाखस्य सितामेकां तृतीयामक्षयां शृणु” ॥ 

\(Of what avail is stating with plentiful words? Just listen to the topic of the *Parva* of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā* coming in the month *vaiśākha*.\) This statement proclaims the superiority of this *parva*. This day is considered as one of the most commendable days for taking bath in the *Gaṅgā* and to worship Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* with *dhūpa*, *dīpa*,* Pushpa* and *Candana*. *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, the God of all gods refers to *Badari* as “My *Āśrama*” and narrates the great benefits one gets by going on a pilgrimage to *Badarī*.

गच्छोद्धव मयाऽदिष्टः बदर्याख्यं ममाश्रमम् ।  
> तत्र मत्पादतीर्थोदे स्नानोपस्पर्शनैः शुचिः ।  
> ईक्षयालकनन्दाया विधूताशेषकल्मषः । \(श्रीमद्भागवत xi-29\) 

\(O *Uddhava*, I command you to visit *Badarī* which is my *āśrama*. By bathing in my *Śrīpadatīrtha* there and doing *ācamana*, and by the contact and the sight of the water of *Alakanandā* you will be freed from all the sins.\) *Tḷrumaṅgai Āḷvar*, the best among devotees, declares—“Undertake the *Badarīyātra* before reaching the state of walking with the help of a stick with a bent back, and the state of \(keeping repeatedly\) coughing \(due to old age\). It is the doorway to salvation.” And *Akshya Tṛtīyā* is the day on which the gate of *Badarinārāyaṇa mandira*, the greatest of the pilgrimages, is opened. It can be termed alternatively as the day of opening of the doors for emancipation.

This day also happens to be the day of incarnation of *Paraśurāma,* who is referred to as *Brahmakshatra Avatāra*, and whose incarnation is the sixth among the ten *avatāras* of Lord *Vishṇu*.

The *Akshaya Tṛtīyā Parva* is praised as a great day for the worshipping of gods and also for the worshipping of the manes.

The day is also considered the first day of *Satya Yuga*, which is the first among the four *yugas*. It is also considered a good day for sowing seeds in the fields.

This *parva* is called *Akshaya Tṛtīya* because the *snāna*, *japa, tapas, adhyāyana*, *tarpaṇa* and *dāna* and other rituals performed on this day bring in inexhaustible merit to the doer. *\(Akshaya Phala Tṛtīyā\)*

\(“स्नात्वा हुत्वा च जप्त्वा च दत्त्वानन्तफलं लभेत्”\(*Vratarāja*\) The name is also well suited because it bestows on the performer *akshayamoksha*. The *Kannada* name *‘Akshatadige’,* is the vernacular form of the word *Akshaya Tṛtīya.*

### The time of observance:

It is stated that this *parva* should be observed on *Vaiśākha śukla tṛtīyā*. What should be the extent of the *Tithi* on that day? Does it require a conjunction of *Vāra* and *nakshatra*? What is the outcome of these? Let us discuss these points in detail.

The *tṛtīyā tithi* should extend from sunrise to midday on that day.

“सा च पूर्वाह्‌णव्यापिनी ग्राह्या” It is possible that the *tṛtiyātithi* may be touching the *caturthī*. *“Gaurīvināyakopetā”*, But if the duration of the *tithi* is less than six *ghatikās* on the next day, the *Vrata-parvas* should be celebrated on the previous day itself. If it extends beyond six *ghatikās,* the *parva* should be celebrated the next day.

“त्रिमुहूर्ताधिकव्याप्तिसत्त्वे परा, त्रिमुहूर्तन्यूनत्वे पूर्वा” \(*Dharma Sindhu*\) If that day happens to be a Wednesday \(or Monday\) and if it has the conjunction with star *Rohiṇi*, it is very commendable. But, just for the sake of that conjunction, the *parva* should not be observed the previous day. \[i.e. even if such a conjunction occurs on the previous day, the *parva* should not be observed\] which means, this *Vrata* should not be observed when *Dvitīyā* and *Tṛtīyā* occur on the same day. Just as the pervasion of *Tṛtīya* in the *purvāhṇa* is prescribed, the prohibition of the observance on the day when *Tṛtīyā* has pervasion in the afternoon, is also done clearly.

> पूर्वाह्‌णे तु सदा कार्याः शुक्ले मनुयुगादयः ।  
> दैव्ये कर्मणि पित्र्ये च कृष्णे चैवापराह्‌णिकाः ॥  
> वैशाखस्य तृतीयां च पूर्वविद्धां करोति वै ।  
> हव्यं देवा न गृह्‌णन्ति कव्यं च पितरस्तथा ॥ 

\(For the observance of *Manvādi* and *Ugādi*, only the *tṛtīyā* of the *Śuklapaksha* which has pervasion in the forenoon, has to be considered. Only in the *Kṛshṇapaksha* it can be considered, if it pervades in the afternoon, both for religious rites of gods or *pitṛs*. If it is considered when it pervades in the afternoon in the *śuklapaksha*, all the worships offered will go in vain, says the *Vratarāja*.\)

### Vrata Parva procedures

Early in the morning on that day, bath should be taken in the *Gaṅgā* as a part of the *Vrata,* along with vows. \(वैशाखे शुक्लपक्षे तु तृतीयायां तथैव च । गङ्गातोये नरः स्नात्वा मुच्यते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ॥\) *\(Nirṇayasindhu\)* Those who cannot afford to bathe in the *Gaṅgā* directly, should invoke HER in the water in which they wish to take bath, worship her and then take the bath. And, purified by such a bath, they should worship their *ishṭadevatā* and especially *Lakshmīnārāyaṇa* and *Śrī Kṛshṇa,* along with the rituals for the manes.

> वैशाखस्य तृतीयायां श्रीसमेतं जगद्गुरुम् ।  
> नारायणं पूजयेच्च पुष्पधूपविलेपनैः ॥ 

It is very auspicious to apply sandal paste on the idol of Lord *Kṛshṇa* during his worship.

> यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनलेपितम् ।  
> वैशाखस्य सिते पक्षे स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ \(धर्मसिन्धु\) 

The *ŚrīKṛshṇamantra* should be chanted. *Tarpaṇa* should be performed for the *pitṛs* and *Pinḍapradāna* should be done. After that, gifts of wheat, barley, roasted barley powder, Bengal gram, many varieties of cooked rice, especially curd rice, a pot filled with water and other articles useful for the summer season, should be made to the suitable persons. And the gift of cash should also be made along with other gifts. Offering of gold is very auspicious. The rule of *Ekabhukta* \(i.e. eating only once\) should be observed on that day.

### The Science of Time

The *Parva* is celebrated on the *śukla tṛtīyā* of *Vaiśākha* which comes only in the *vasantaṛtu*. We have already described in the chapters of *Rāmanavamī* and *Ugādi*, that *Vasanta* among seasons, and *śuklapaksha,* are most commendable for the worship of god, and for rituals relating to gods. Now let us discuss the *māsa*, *tithi* and *nakshatra* of the *parva*.

#### Māsa
**A\) *Māsa:*** In the celebration of this festival, barley is prescribed as the main substance for *Havana*, *pūja* and *dāna*. Gifting wheat, Bengalgram and roasted barley powder are also mentioned as the most suitable ones for *dāna*. In our country which is predominantly agricultural, it is only in the month of *vaiśākha* all these \(grains\) become readily available, both for consumption and for sacrificial and religious purposes. Thus the science in \(mentioning\) *Vaiśākha* as the month may be noticed, when all the specific materials required for the ritual of the *parva* are available in plenty.

Further, *Meshasaṅkramaṇa*, the most auspicious time of *Vishuvat* comes in this month only. We have already discussed and explained the importance of this *puṇyakāla*, in the chapter on *Ugādi*. This *saṅkramaṇa* and the time proximate to it, are the most suitable times for worshipping the *pitṛs*. Therefore it has to be noted here that the month of *vaiśākha* is convenient for the observance of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, which is best for the worship of both *devas* and *pitṛs*. Though the advantage of the spring season is available in *caitra* the month previous to this, there is no guarantee that grains arrive at homes in the ready-to-use form. And also, the *Vishusaṅkramaṇa* does not occur in that month. It \(i.e. *Caitra*\) is considered as a *Kharamāsa* because of the happening of *Mīnasaṅkramaṇa* in that month.

#### Tithi
**b\) *Tithi***: The *tithi* of this *parva*, viz. *tṛtīyā* is called *‘Jayātithi’*. And that too, the *Jayātithi* of *Śukla Paksha* is very auspicious.

		
> नन्दा भद्रा जया रिक्ता पूर्णाःस्युः तिथयः पुनः ।  
> पर्यायत्वेन विज्ञेयाः ॥\(पीयूषधारा = नारद वचन\) 

“उदकुम्भान् सकनकान् सान्नान् सर्वरसैः सह ।  
“यवगोधूमचणकान् सक्तु दध्योदनं तथा ॥\(निर्णय सिन्धु\) 

The name *Jayā* indicates that it is the precious time for success, ie the securing of the accomplishment of the endeavours taken up with auspicious intentions.

We have also heard that *tṛtīyā* conjoined with *caturthī tithi* is highly auspicious for this festival. *‘Gaurī Vināyakopetā’*. *Tṛtīyā* is considered to be the *tithi* of goddess *Gauri* who bestows auspiciousness for all living beings, and *caturthī* as the *tithi* of Lord *Gaṇeśa*, the remover of all obstacles. “चतुर्थीगणनाथस्य” गौर्याः तत्पूर्ववासरे” \(Agnipurāṇa\)

The union of these two *tithis* which is dear to these gods \(i.e. Goddess *Gauri* and Lord *Gaṇeśa*\) is indeed \(a time\) which cherishes the removal of obstacles and the accomplishment of auspiciousness, brought about by the tranquility of the said time.

The main reason for laying down that the *tṛtīyā tithi* should extend till noon is because *śuklapaksha* is dear to gods. As it is the domain of the gods, they desire the forenoon only for their worship. Also, in the duration of the day, the forenoon is dear to gods and the afternoon to the *pitṛs*. If any worship is offered in the afternoon of a *śuklapaksha,* it enters the sway of the *pitṛs* typically. So the *śāstras* stipulate only such a *tithi* which has a forenoon pervasion, and as the bright half of a month belongs to the gods, it is commended for worships and rituals.

#### Vāra and Nakshatra
**C. *Vāra and Nakshatra***. *Yogis* says that if on that day, there is a conjunction of *Rohiṇī* with either Monday or Wednesday, it is a \(rare\) *Yoga* which is a result of imperishable good deeds. This is because, those two days and *Rohiṇī* are very auspicious days for the worship of Lord *Kṛshṇa*. So, on *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, it is only *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who is to be specially worshipped after the worship of the *ishṭadevatā* isn’t it?

> यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनलेपितम् ।  
> वैशाखस्य सिते पक्षे स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ 

\(We shall explain how the \(conjunction of the\) above said day and star \(*Rohiṇī*\) match well for the worship of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, in the chapter of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī.*\)

#### Gaṅgā Snāna
**d\) *Gaṅgā Snāna***

***Vidhi Vijnāna*\(Modalities\):** While discussing the rules of celebrating *Akshayatṛtīyā*, we have stated that a dip in the holy *Gaṅgā* is most auspicious. According to *Vagbhata*, even the \(regular\) bath taken in clean water on any day, is \(highly\) beneficial.

> दीपनं वृष्यमायुष्यं स्नानमूर्जाबलप्रदम् ।  
> कण्डूमलश्रमस्वेदतन्द्रातृड्दाहपाप्मजित्\(वाग्भट 2:15\) 

A bath stimulates *agni* in the stomach, increases the virility in the body, promotes long life and gives enthusiasm and strength. It removes itching, dirt, exhaustion, sweat, lethargic sleep, thirst, burning sensation, and sins. During *parvakālas*, water \(used for bathing\) possesses special powers to induce *puṇya*. Water used by *jnānis* and blessed by their grace is termed as *Tīrtha*. \(“ऋषिजुष्टजले गुरौ”-अमर\) \(यदध्यासितमर्हद्भिः तद्धि तीर्थं प्रचक्षते”-कुमारसम्भव सर्ग-6\) Taking a holy bath in that water cures not only bodily ailments but also mental illnesses.

		
Taking bath in clean water removes bodily dirt, sloth and fatigue and this is commonly experienced by all. But ordinary knowledge does not help in understanding how it can remove sins and bestow *puṇya*. Unless this is understood scientifically, the importance of having *Gaṅgāsnāna* on *akshyatṛtīyā* as prescribed by the *śāstras* cannot be known. Therefore we are taking this up for discussion. As a backdrop to this, we would like to give the commentary \(as commanded\) by Śrī Raṅgamahāguru pertaining to this.

##### Puṇya and Pāpa
A background for the introduction to Puṇya and Pāpa.

“What do puṇya and pāpa mean? Generally no one ponders about that. The words—*‘Puṇya* is accrued”, “*Pāpa* has perished”—uttered by people casually, sometime sound as though they have better knowledge than those who have understood them clearly. But, are they visible to the naked eyes like the coming and going of, say a cow or a calf? Then what are they? A solid? Liquid? Gas? What is their form? Where are they located? How long do they exist? They are not meant for animals right? If they are applicable only to human beings, where do they remain and how long? Don’t they get reduced to ashes along with the person who has earned them, after he dies? Such questions naturally arise. They can be comprehended only when they are seen through the discriminating eyes of jnānis. Merit and sin are a kind of distinctive marks \(impressions\) recorded on the gramophone plate of the mind. They are also called *Samskāras* and *Vāsanās*. The impressions causing happiness are called *Puṇya* and the ones that cause misery are called *Pāpa*. Both these are marks imprinted on the mind. It is almost impossible to erase these inner impressions. They do not perish even when the soul leaves the body. As evident from the words “मनष्षष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति”, the mind also goes with him. All the old records of impressions will be present in the mind. They stay with the person as long as the relationship between the *jīva* and the mind exists. These marks do not touch the person who crosses the wheel of mind itself and flies to the place of Brahman. In all other persons, the impressions of *puṇya* bring happiness and the impressions of pāpa bring misery, and this phenomenon exists for ever. Deeds performed to imprint the marks of merit lead to happiness, and the ones contrary to that, lead to misery.”

By minding this principle as explained below, one can easily understand how a holy bath can absolve sins and cause *puṇya*.

1. A religious bath taken in the holy waters wash out all the dirt and inertia of the body. Tranquility is felt in the mind. Turbidity caused by the sinful impressions get removed. Mind becomes clear. Some marks of misery get erased and comfort sets in. Such comfort-causing marks are indeed *puṇya*. The crooked marks which get erased are *pāpa*. This should be understood clearly. 
2. Some *tīrthas* have the capacity to cure both bodily and mental ailments, as they \(the *tīrthas*\) come into contact with medicinal herbs and holy ground surfaces \(while they flow\). One who takes a bath in them is benefitted with the cure of bodily and mental ailments. 
3. Even by pondering about the meaning of names given to the holy waters by the *maharshis* such as *‘Pāpanaśini’*, *mānasasarovara*, *Bindu-sarovara*, *Nārada kuṇḍa* and *Gaurīkuṇḍa*, bad impressions vanish and good impressions get recorded in the mind. 
4. While taking a bath in the holy waters, if one remembers the virtues of *Jnānis* and their auspicious deeds with the feeling-“This is the water which the *jnānis* have used for bath. As said in ‘सन्मनुष्यमनो यथा’, their minds are pellucid. They are free from the dirt of the *guṇas viz., rajas* and *tamas*. They dwell in a *Śuddhātma* who is free from *vikāras.*” And, by remembering their holy deeds, bad *samskāras* vanish and good *samskāras* arise. 
5. Also, chanting of holy *mantras* while bathing helps in routing bad impressions, and good impressions get imprinted on the mind. 
6. If auspicious feelings are mixed in the waters \(to be used for bathing\) after a good *Saṅkalpa*, then the bath becomes not just a dip in the water in the physical sense, but a dip in the holy *atma tīrtha*. “आत्मैव सर्वतीर्थानि” “मन्मनो मीनवन्नित्यं क्रीडत्यानन्दवारिधौ” \(My mind always enjoys in the ocean of bliss like a fish”\) Such sacred feelings are hidden in the above words. 
7. During a dip in the waters, breathing gets stopped \(for a while\). It creates the natural *kumbhaka state* for the *Adhikāris* with a good mindset, and makes their mind immersed in *śubhālambana* \(auspicious support\). The supreme bliss produced from that becomes not just a dip in the water in the physical sense, but a dip that clears all bad impressions undoubtedly. 
8. With the sacred contact of the lotus feet of the *jnānis*, the *tīrthas* are rendered even more great and powerful, to remove sins. “तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि तीर्थभूता हि साधवः” \(*Jnānis* make the *tīrthas* holier. They themselves are *tīrthas,* says *Bhagavān Vyāsa*\). A narrative, popular in the society of saints may be remembered here. A *sādhaka* who was standing near a hermitage of a *Brahmarshi* happened to see some women in dreadful form entering the hermitage. After sometime, he saw some women divinely beautiful women coming out of the *Āśrama*. Stopping them he asked who they are. They said, “We are *Gaṅgā* and other rivers deities. People taking bath in our waters become pure dropping all their sins on us. We became ugly like female demons on taking their sins. But on entering the hermitage of the *Brahmarshi* and staying there with devotion for a while in their presence, we got back our natural divine form.” Then the *sādhaka* asked them—“Then did the *Brahmarshi* get a dreadful from by taking your sins?” “No” they said. “The sins do not touch them at all. They were reduced to ashes by the very sight of *Brahmarshis*.” The *jnānis* untouched by either *puṇya* or *pāpa*, purify them \(the waters\) and make them *tīrthas*, and therefore, those who take bath in the *tīrthas* shed their sins and become pure. 
9. On some occasions, the *brahmajnānis* who visit the *tīrthas*, happen to touch the waters with their divine minds, sights and bodies, and pass into them a divine energy stream with the wish “Let these *tīrthas* acquire the power of ridding bad *samskāras* of people who bathe, for a specific span of time. Let them obtain the capacity to fill good *samskāras* in such people. Let them acquire the capacity to carry them \(the devotees\) to the *Brāhmi* state which is free from *puṇyas* and *papas.*” Those who take bath in such sacred *tīrthas* which are filled with the divine willpower, reap the above said benefits accordingly. 

##### Gaṅgā eminence
The eminence of the holy waters of Gaṅgā

The word *Gaṅgā* means something which gives *mukti* \(‘सद्गतिं गमयतीति गङ्गा’\) The word applies to a goddess and also to the river presided over by that goddess. *Śāstras* and traditions openly praise the holy bath in the sacred river in similitude with the \(*dhyāna*\) of that goddess. They profusely praise not just the holy bath in the river and drinking of its sacred water, but also the very sight and the remembrance of it. \(A few of\) such extolling statements are collected as under.

> दृष्टा तु हरते पापं स्पृष्टा तु त्रिदिवं नयेत् ।  
> प्रसङ्गगेनापि या गङ्गा मोक्षदा त्ववगाहिता ॥ 

Even a casual *darśan* of the river removes sins. If one touches it, it leads him to heaven and a holy bath in it leads one to *moksha*.

A person approaching the river for a bath is blessed to obtain with ease the benefits of performing *yajnas* like *Aśvamedha* and *Rājasūya*, with each step he places towards it.

		
> यस्यां स्नानार्थं चागच्छतः पुंसः पदे पदे अश्वमेधराज-  
सूयादीनां फलं न दुर्लभमिति\(भागवत 1-130\) 

*Gaṅgā* is the image of God in the form of water. Worshipping her is equal to the worshipping of the *devatās*. The very same fruits of the *darshan* of God will be obtained by one who even sees the *Gaṅgā*.

> इयमेव शिवस्य तोयरूपा मूर्तिः ।-  
> गङ्गायां पूजितायां तु पूजिताः सर्वदेवताः । 

> यत्फलं जायते पुंसां दर्शनात् परमात्मनः।-  
> तद्भवेदेव गङ्गायाः दर्शने भकिभावतः ॥ 

If one takes a holy bath with *bhakti* in the *Gaṅgā* even once, his entire family \(lineage\) also gets *Sadgati*.

> यैः पुण्यवाहिनी गङ्गा सकृद्भक्त्यावगाहिता ।-  
> तेषां कुलानां लक्षं तु भवात्तारयते शिवा ॥ 

One who inspires others to have a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā* gets blessed with *sadgati*.

> ये गच्छन्ति स्वतो गङ्गां परांश्च प्रेरयन्ति ये ।  
> इह ते सर्वभोगानामन्ते ज्ञानस्य भाजनम् ॥ 

Performing of *yajna*, *dāna*, *tapas* and *japa* on the banks of the *Gaṅgā* causes infinite benefits.

> यज्ञो दानं तपो जप्यं श्राद्धं च सुरपूजनम् ।  
> गङ्गायां यत्कृतं सर्वं कोटिकोटिगुणं भवेत् ॥ 

*Sadgati* is attained invariably by a person who, knowingly or unknowingly, casts off his mortal coil there.

> गङ्गायां ज्ञानतो मुक्त्वा मुक्तिमाप्नोति मानवः ।  
> अज्ञानात् ब्रह्मलोकं च याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥\(कूर्मपुराण\) 

Even remembering her name is itself an act of great religious merit.

> गच्छंस्तिष्ठन् स्वपन् ध्यायन् जाग्रन् भुञ्जन् श्वसन् वदन् ।  
> यः स्मरेत् सततं गङ्गां स च मुच्येत बन्धनात् ॥ 

Even taking a bath directly in the *Gaṅgā* causes *Puṇya*.

		
> गङ्गास्नानफलं ब्रह्मन् गङ्गायामेव लभ्यते ।  
> यथा द्राक्षाफलस्वादो द्राक्षायामेव नान्यतः ॥ 

*Śrī Śaṅkarācārya* says “If a person \(unable to have a bath directly in the *Gaṅgā*\) chants the thousand names of the river \(*Gaṅgāsahasranāma*\), he earns spiritual rewards equivalent to the act of having a holy bath in the sacred *Gaṅgā*. Drinking even a drop of holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* leads to immortality. Even the banks of the *Gaṅgā* are very sacred.”

> गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता ।\(भजगोविन्द स्तोत्र\)  
> गङ्गातीरमनुत्तमं हि सकलम् ॥\(मणिकर्णिकाष्टक\) 

##### Gaṅgā - ailments and health 
2. The power of Gaṅgā to cure ailments and to bestow health.

Many Ayurvedic texts tell us that, besides absolving people of sins, and blessing with *Sadgati*, the water of *Gaṅgā* is very tasty, removes a number of diseases, and helps to acquire good health.

“All the rivers which take their origin on the slopes of the *Himālaya* mountains have medicinal value. Their waters consumed by *devarshis* are really beneficial” says *Caraka*.

> हिमवत्प्रभवाः पथ्याः पथ्याः देवर्षिसेविताः । 

The prince of ayurvedic physicians by name *Cakrapāṇidatta*, confirms this view point.

“यथोक्तलक्षणहिमवत्प्रभवत्वादेव गाङ्गं पथ्यम् ।” 

*Vagbhata’s Ashṭāngahṛdaya* also states that these \(rivers\) do have medicinal properties, and are enduring *tīrthas*.

> “हिमवन्मलयोद्भूताः पथ्यास्ता एव च स्थिराः ।” 

A work by name *Bhojanakutūhala* showers rains of praises thus:-*“Gaṅgatīrtha* is cool, sweetish, clean, very tasty, suitable to health, digestive, improves digestion, removes sins, relieves thirst, quells infatuation, increases appetite and sharpens the intellect.”

> शीतं स्वादु स्वच्छमत्यन्तरुच्यं पथ्यं पाक्यं पाचनं पापहारि ।  
> तृष्णामोहध्वंसनं दीपनं च प्रज्ञां धत्ते वारि भागीरथीजम् ॥ 

##### Modern views 
Views on the quality \(properties\) of Gaṅgā by people belonging to other religions, and experiments by modern physicians and their opinions.

History tells us that the healthy qualities of the waters of *Gaṅgā* have attracted not just the Hindus, but the followers of other religions also who were cognizant of its use and were dxiligently consuming it. A travelogue writer by name Iben Batuta tells that Mohammed Bin Tughlak used to get *Gaṅgā* water from Doulathabād regularly. And it would take forty days to reach him. \(Gibb’s Translation, P. 183\)

A book pertaining to Akbar by name Ayine Akbari tells that Akbar considered *Gaṅgatīrtha* on par with nectar. He was drinking it both at home and during travel. He had appointed trusted officers to get him sealed *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Though water from river *Yamunā* or rainwater was used for cooking purposes, a small quantity of water from *Gaṅgā* was being added to that. Not just Akbar, even the bigot Aurangazeb used to love *Gaṅgātīrtha*. A French physician of those times by name Vernier tells us-“*Gaṅgātīrtha* is being kept along with other food stuff and drinks of the king in Delhi and Agra. It would be there even in his travels. Camels used to carry it.” “Even Muslim Nawabs stupefied by its healthy properties, were consuming it.”—statements like this can also be seen \(Narrative P. 248\). Gulām Hussain in his book on the history of Bengal writes “No water can be equal to the water of the *Gaṅgā* in sweetness, taste and the quality of lightness. It does not deteriorate even after a long time.” Taivernier says “It would cost two to three thousand rupees to get *Gaṅgātīrtha* from a long distance and to distribute during marriages.” We come across a statement which says that after the Bhūtān War, the Tūshilāmas of Tibet bought land on the shores of *Gaṅgā* and built a monastery there. Modern physicians and scholars have conclusively stated after conducting experiments that the water of *Gaṅgā* is curative of ailments and a sure cure for skin diseases and infectious diseases, and it does not get stale like the water of other rivers. One Dr. Nelson has said “*Gaṅgātīrtha* taken from Calcutta and carried to London by ship would be thoroughly pure. But water from Thames would turn stale before it could reach Bombay. When I landed in Agra, I came to know of the astonishing fact that the water of *Gaṅgā* had the property of destroying bacteria.” After conducting research on *Gaṅgātīrtha* Dr. Han Cran declared—“We drew water from the *Gaṅgā* at *Kāsi* from a spot where a lot of dirt was getting collected. It contained cholera spreading germs in lakhs. When we examined the water after six hours, we found that all the cholera germs had died. The same was the result in the water collected at a spot where a dead body was floating. When the cholera causing germs were let into pure water, they found that they had multiplied in large numbers. And when placed in *Gaṅgātīrtha* they became dead within six hours. Therefore we began to use the *Gaṅgātīrtha* now and then for curing diseases.” *Pandit Ṭhakūrdatta Sharma*, a researcher of the periodical *“Amṛtadhāra”* says that experiments have confirmed that *Gaṅgātīrtha* kills cholera germs. One *Kaviraj Pratāp Simha* has cured a number of cholera patients in his clinic treating them with the water of *Gaṅgā*. To the question why cholera does not figure in the list of diseases in Bhutan, he says”—They drink only the water of *Gaṅgā*. They bathe the cholera afflicted patient in the *Gaṅgā* and cool him down. They make him drink *Gaṅgātīrtha* frequently and cure him of the diseases the doctors there say. “Water of the *Gaṅgotri* cures diabetes” “By using *Gaṅgātīrtha* in injections, many diseases have been cured.” the doctors say.

##### Gaṅgatīrtha qualities 
A Discussion on the praise of the qualities of *Gaṅgatīrtha*.

**a\) A discussion on its capacity to cure diseases**

		
We have already noted scriptural evidences and also the statements of modern physicians based on experiments, which declare that *Gaṅgatīrtha* has the potential to remove sins and cure physical ailments. Here, some people argue “Only because it has the power to cure bodily ailments and improve health, it is called holy water.” And they comment—“The reason for this belief is the presence of some special chemicals in that water which absorb the bacteria in the water and kill them. The cholera bacteria themselves get dissolved and die in it\! The human body is benefited most by the use of this kind of water\! That is why our ancestors who understood this, called *Gaṅgā* holy and attached religious importance to that.” But this is a wrong opinion. Because, many substances prescribed as medicines which fecilitate health and nourishment are prohibited for consumption when one is healthy. And they are not considered sacred just because they are healthy. On the contrary, persons who pursue spirituality seriously are barred from consuming them, when their health is alright.

**For example:-**‘औषधार्थं पिबेन्मद्यम्’ \(liquor should be consumed as a medicine\) i.e. In some diseases, alchohol should be taken in a certain quantity as medicine. Though recommended as healthy \(in exceptional cases\), alchohol is not considered as sacred. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, a Mahāvaidya, used to say ṝ “Onion and garlic are indeed healthy substances. Raw onion is a good medicine for farmers, who inhale unavoidably dust in the fields. It increases urination and clears the dust collected inside, through urine, and cleans the body. So it is recommended for the farmers, at that time. Garlic removes rheumatism and improves digestion. It is a best remedy for diseases of rheumatism and indigestion.” He also used to caution “But these \(onions and garlic\) are not helpful for those who pursue spiritual life. So, they should not be consumed by people whose inclination is mainly towards spirituality.” Thereore, it is not correct to say that all those things that contribute to health can annihilate sins. And there is no substance in the argument that *Gaṅgā* came to be considered as sacred only because of its capacity to cure ailments.

Many ancient and modern physicians have proclaimed by experiments that *Gaṅgātīrtha* has the capacity to cure many diseases. But we have to come to a conclusion in this matter only after examining their opinions, and arguments of objections.

Now, argument that the water of *Gaṅgā* does not cure diseases, but causes diseases: “*Gaṅgā* is clean only at the place of its origin, and only for a few kilometers further. In all other places, it is a stream of filth and pollution. It’s water is full of filth and it is nothing but an open drain and stinking gutters. It is a godown of bacteria.”

The reasons for these are as follows. Dangerous chemicals and effluents from many industries join *Gaṅga* river in plenty exereting urine and faces on its banks is common. Animals are washed in those waters. During festivals, thousands of people take bath at the same place, and the dirt of their bodies collects in the river. In pilgrimage centers like *Kāśī*, half burnt corpses are thrown in abundance into the river, spoiling the water further. Therefore river *Gaṅgā* is one of the most polluted rivers of our country. Germs which cause typhoid, cholera, gastroeneteritis, hepatitis and tapeworms in the stomach, spread by consuming \(drinking\) that polluted water.” This is the statement issued by an organization called *Gāndhi Śāntipīṭha*. A research work in 1976 by physicians has reported that the water of river *Gaṅgā* is unfit for consumption. We cannot refute this opinion which is based on medical research. But there is also a statement from physicians which says-“Abundant bacteria in the water was noticed by us. But we also noticed that after six hours all the germs had died.” These are opinions that have come up at different times. We need to find out the quality of water only by scientific examination from time to time. Contextually, it has to be noted that generally all rivers are naturally gifted with the property of purifying their waters.

###### Self purifying rivers
The natural capacity of rivers to purify themselves

Generally all rivers naturally purify their water themselves. Scientists explain it in a book \(*Holasu Tumbida namma nadigalu—BSN\)* as follows:-In rivers, bacteria which clean water are also present. There are two types of bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. Bacteria belonging to the first type thrive on oxygen. The bacteria of the second type abhor vital air and live without oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria destroy the solid substances at the bottom of the stream, and the one of the other variety destroy the substances on the surface of water. And these bacteria devour even organic matter that are present in filthy water. When they enter the body of the bacteria those organic matters get converted into inorganic matter. They wont decay. They cause no harm. Moreover, some of the single cell bacteria present in the water destroy disease causing germs in the filth. “Aerobic bacteria take away the oxygen dissolved in water which is their food. Is it not harmful?”, one may ask. The answer is, even if oxygen is lost like that, the rivers draw oxygen present in the atmosphere to make up for the loss. And also, the algae in the water produce oxygen by photosynthesis, and supply it to the bacteria.

When the organic matter get reduced in the river water, the aerobes get reduced in number because of lack of food. Then the river increases its oxygen content by absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere. But if the amount of filth in the water is too much, the process of purification slows down. Because, the bacteria that devour the organic matter coming with the filth in large numbers, grow in large quantities and empty the oxygen content \(in the river\). The river by itself cannot make good this enormous loss of oxygen. Then the aerobes and the bacteria-killing single celled organisms, die due to lack of oxygen. Then the entire river becomes a settlement of the aerobes. They get a lot of food, and, oxygen that is inimical to them will also be not present there. Therefore they multiply on the surface of water. In addition to this, they release a foul smelling black coloured toxic gas called hydrogensulphide to water, and render it black and stinking. They cause the vegetation in the river to die. The fish in the water also die because of the lack of sufficient oxygen. And the entire river gets polluted.

This is the capacity of rivers to purify themselves commonly seen. Since *Gaṅgā* flows across medicinal plants and herbs, its capacity to destroy germs and to purify may be greater. Even then, if the river is dumped with filth all the time beyond a limit, the above purification capability may get weakned.

######  Preview of the argument

Simply because river *Gaṅgā* is getting overpolluted and becoming an abode of diseases due to our own thoughtlessness, it does not mean that the statement that *Gaṅgātīrtha* is by itself is disease-resistant and health-promoting is untrue. If unwise persons mix poison with nectar like milk and meet with death, it does not go to falsify the statement that milk by itself is nectar like.

It is an act of great sin to pollute river waters with sewage. Even while bathing in the rivers, we should not let our body dirt into them. Bath should be taken elsewhere and, with a pure body and mind, one should take a dip in river waters with the feeling that it is a sacred water flowing from the holy feet of the Lord. While proclaiming these words, we feel horripilated to remember the great value attached to the purification of river water by our *śāstras*. We should decry ourselves for the heinous act of letting various filths into the waters of great rivers without an iota of hesitation\! This is indeed the result of deviating from the dos and don’ts prescribed by *jnānis*, and it is nothing but the crookedness of the mind to add filth to the flow of river waters, advancing the ruse that the rivers are gifted with the capacity to purify themselves. Rivers by themselves remove the filth accumulated unavoidably. But the offence of adding filth to them should not be commited from our side. It is not wrong to cleanse and purify polluted rivers scientifically without causing damage to their properties. It should necessarily be taken up even if it may cost much, as the great benefit of health is obtained thereby.

A story goes like this-Someone said that sewage should not be let into the *Gaṅgā* and dead bodies should not be thrown into its waters. Goddess *Gaṅgā* appeared in their dream and said-“Why do you insult my greatness? Have you no belief in the fact that I have the capacity to destroy any filth of any quantity? You have no right to tell that filth or dead bodies should not be let into my waters” The truth of this story is worth discussing. This goes against the principle that we have to take a holy bath in a river and not the mere bath that removes dirt from the body. It is common sense to know that a holy great river which is to be worshipped as a goddess should not be polluted, either with body filth or with the filth of mind. We can see that as a rule, even idols of gods are cleaned before giving them a bath and then they are given an *Abhisheka* with *pañcāmṛta* and *śuddhodaka*. When we look at this, it can be understood that it is not wrong to purify scientifically and consume the waters of rivers, which are like deities.

To conclude, it can be said that the water of *Gaṅgā* by itself, has the special capacity to cure ailments. This matter has been established by experiments. We should profit from this god given gift. But it is a great sin to deliberately add poison to this nectar and commit an offence against divinity and the living beings, who use its water. It should be given up. We should safeguard the purity of this great river which is a gift of god and accomplish our purity also.

1. The argument that *Gaṅgātīrtha* has the capacity to cure illness, is just an idea of sentimental origin.

Answer: *Gaṅgātīrtha* has an uncommon ability to cure diseases. In the *Mānasasarovaratīrtha,* which is it’s origin, and in its tributaries such as *Alakanandā*, *Mandākinī* and also in the great water streams of *Gaṅgā* which is formed by the confluence of the above rivers, there exists a potential to cure indigestion, sloth, some types of fever and some contagious diseases, and the water of *Gaṅgā* is a nourishing drink. These facts have been established by the experiments of many physicians. But one Dr. Kovoor of recent times, has stated that there is nothing special about *Gaṅgātīrtha,* and he states that this is proved by his experience. He gives an example of an incident that occurred in his life.

“When I set out for Kolkata from Kerala for further studies, Hindus in my village had requested me to bring the holy water from *Gaṅgā*. But on reaching Calcutta, it was nauseating to see the dirty water of *Gaṅgā*. My conscience did not agree to give this water to the devout people, which could cause diseases from germs. On my return journey from Kolkata, I took some water from a well in a railway station near my village and gave it to the village people telling them that it is the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* which was requested for. Many people who drank that water came to me and shared their experiences.—“We are grateful to you. Just by drinking a few drops of that *Gaṅgātīrtha,* my chronic illness vanished. My sister also was relieved of such and such an evil.” So it can be established that, the above said cure became possible only by faith cure and there is nothing special about *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Because, I had not given them the real *Gaṅgātīrtha* at all” This has been put forth by him as a proof \(Be gone Godmen\)

We do not say that the incident quoted by him is untrustworthy. But the conclusion drawn by him is unscientific because, he has not stated what exactly was the effect of consuming *Gaṅgātīrtha*. The only thing that is conveyed by the incident is that a good effect was the result because some well water was consumed with the faith that it was *Gaṅgātīrtha*. So, *Gaṅgā* came to be invoked in some \(ordinary\) water, with a full faith that it was *Gaṅgā*, though it was actually not *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Thus, the fact that there is great power even in sentimental *Gaṅgā*, has become loudly clear.

In reality, *Gaṅgā* and other *tīrthas* are present within us. *Jnānis* enjoy bliss by immersing themselves in that internal *Gaṅgā*. The scriptures of *maharshis* declare that the external holy waters \(*tīrthas*\) are instrumental in taking ordinary people to the internal *tīrthas*. “आत्मैव सर्वतीर्थानि”, “यः स्नाति मानसे तीर्थे स याति परमां गतिम्”, “त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा.”

*Śāstras* have prescribed in our *Nityakarmavidhi* itself, that *Gaṅgā* should be invoked in any water used for bathing.

> इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति, शुतद्रि स्तोमं सचता परुष्णिया ।  
> असिक्निया मरुद्वृधे वितस्तयार्जीकीये शृणु ह्यासुषोमया ॥\(महानारायण\) 

> गङ्गे च यमुने चैव गोदावरि सरस्वति ।  
> नर्मदे सिन्धु कावेरि जलेऽस्मिन् सन्निधिं कुरु ॥ 

Thus, drinking of even sentimental *Gaṅgā* \(water\) can help in the curing of diseases. We have noted previously, that not only sentimental devotees but even discriminating scientists, and people with first hand experience have stated that actual *Gaṅgātīrtha* has even more potential in that regard. It is our responsibility to maintain the holy water of *Gaṅgā* in the natural state and use it for the curing of both mental and physical ailments.

######  The redemptive power
The redemptive power of *Gaṅgā:* An explanation

Let us agree for the moment that clean *Gaṅgātīrtha* when consumed, can cure diseases. But how to believe that it has redemptive power? Doing worship of God and following the path of *dharma* is known to redeem one’s sins. How can it happen just by drinking water from a river? If sins are redeemed just by drinking water, then the fish, crocodiles and other acquatic creatures that always live in water must be more blessed than human beings, isn’t it? This question naturally arises here. The answer for this can be found by recollecting what Śrīraṅgamahāguru had expounded about the meaning of pāpa and puṇya.

*Pāpa* and *Puṇya* are *samskāras* that are imprinted on the gramophone plate of the mind. The marks which cause misery or misfortunes are called sins and the marks that lead to happiness are called *puṇya*.

The marks of sins disturb the mind, make it impure and cause agitation. They incense the *dhātus* and cause anger in the mind. The impressions of *puṇya* generate waves which dissipate agitation and impurity, and help to attain a state of happiness.

One who has *samskāras* of sins may appear healthy outside, but his *dhātus* remain irritated in the inner layers of his nature. When this agitation within is gone and tranquility prevails, it can be understood that the marks of evil have vanished and sins are removed. It is established by experiment that when holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* is taken with the right disposition mind, the above said effect takes place. When a person sees holy *Gaṅgātīrtha*, takes a holy dip in it and drinks that sacred water, the abnormal nature vanishes and the tranquility of *dhātus* manifests. This can be clearly known by those who are in the path of self realization and the ones who possess the knowledge of the body and corporeal science.

This effect will be there even on ordinary people, at least in small proportions. When this pleasantness of *dhātus* is accomplished completely, then the very realization of *Brahman* occurs as proclaimed by the *Upanishads* in the words “धातुप्रसादत् महिमनमीशम्.” Just as the above said result \(i.e. the pleasantness of *dhātus*\) happens from *tapas* and meditation etc., it also happens in a measure, by drinking the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha*. And that is why it is valued greatly. Thus, as the drinking of the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* causes attainment of the *brahmī* state, it may be called a destroyer of sins, without any doubt.

###### Mechanism of sin-removal
The ways in which the taking of *Gaṅgātīrtha* results in the removal of sins.

A\) Drinking of *Gaṅgātīrtha* causes the removal of ailments and thereby becomes instrumental in the tranquility of the self. Only a healthy person indeed can meditate well says an ayurvedic aphorism.

“अनामयी यावदात्मानं सम्मन्यते” 

Ill health is unnatural and a stronger. It is surely a result of sin. The holy water that removes sins should be indeed called a redeemer. Ill health is the fruit of sins committed during previous lives. *Āyurveda* states “पूर्वजन्मकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते.” The modern medical science has clearly demonstrated that diseases are caused by bacteria. Then, is it not blind faith to say that ill health is a result of sins?-To come to a judgment on a matter without pondering over it right from its origin, is also blind faith. It is not wrong to say that bacteria causes diseases. But to conclude that bacteria alone are the root cause for all diseases is not correct. They happen to be the cause in the intermediate phase. Bacteria can cause illness only when our body becomes weak due to the imbalance caused by *Vāta, pitta* and *kapha* in our system. They cannot cause any disease in the body of a person who possesses a state of balanced *dhātus* and who is robust. Bacteria of the same type and same number, can cause diseases to some, and cannot cause diseases to some others. Therefore the root cause of diseases is the rage \(imbalance\) of *dhātus* in our body system. *Āyurveda* says that the marks that cause the imbalance are nothing but sins and so, sins are responsible for diseases. Thus, *Gaṅgātīrtha* which is capable of correcting the unevenness in dispositions and removing ailments, is indeed the redeemer of sins.

The *Himālayas* abound in medicinal plants, herbs and mountain born minerals. It is natural that *Gaṅgā* which flows across all these, has the power to cure ailments.

B\) *Gaṅgātīrtha* relieves one of sloth and infuses spiritual inspiration. It brings about great happiness of the mind. The cognizance of this comes to the mind only because the marks of sins get washed away.

c\) The blemishes which distort the mind are called sins. How *Gaṅgātīrtha* is capable of removing them, has to be discussed here.

As the Holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* has had the contact of sacred most people, it brings to our mind sacred memories. “Lord *Rudra deva* performed penance in *Rudraprayāg* a on the banks of the holy *Gaṅgā*, regularly drinking its water. *Nara* and *Nārāyaṇa* \(*Arjuna* and Lord *Kṛshṇa*\), did *tapasyā* in the hermitages on the banks of this *Gaṅgā* river consuming this *tīrtha* regularly. They performed fire sacrifices at a place called *Daśāśvamedha* on its banks. The seven *ṛshis* perform rituals in its water Great sages like *Nārada, Vyāsa*, and *Vālmīki* have consumed its holy water.”—When such holy memories come to our mind, bad impressions vanish.

###### Divine and grand reminiscences.

A holy dip in *Gaṅgā* brings to our memory all that has been said in the holy *Vedas, purāṇas*, history and great literary works based on them, which describe the holy bath, the holy men and the power of *Gaṅgā*. These reminiscences will erase all the sinful *samskāras* in our dispositions and purify our mind, intellect and senses.

For example, in the beginning of OM it adorned the water pot of Lord *Brahma*.

‘आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलम्’ It is the sacred water that flowed from the holy feet of Lord *Vishṇu.* “पश्चात्पन्नगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम्” “विष्णुपादोद्भवा गङ्गा” “विष्णुपादात्परिभ्रष्टं प्लावयित्वेन्दुमण्डलम्” “तत्र भगवतः साक्षाद्यज्ञलिङ्गस्य विष्णोर्विक्रमतो वामपादाङ्गुष्ठनखनिर्भिन्नोर्ध्वाण्डकटाहविवरेणान्तः प्रविष्टा या बाह्यजलधारा. . . . साक्षाद्भगवत्पदीति’ “अथाङ्घ्रये प्रोन्नमिताय विष्णोः उपाहरत्पद्मभुवोऽर्हणादिकम्” “धातुः कमण्डलुजलं तदुरुक्रमस्य” “पादावनेजन पवित्रतया नरेन्द्र” “स्वर्धुन्यभून्नभसि सा पतिता निर्मार्ष्टि” “लोकत्रयं भगवतो विशदेव कीर्तिः” It is the holy *tīrtha* that found a blessed abode in the knot of har \(on top of the head\) of the Lord of Lords *\(Śiva\)*

“भूयो शम्भुजटाविभूषणमणिः” ‘भवाङ्गपतितं तोयं पवित्रमिति पस्पृशुः” “निपपात ततो गङ्गा धन्ये शिवशिरस्युत” “नैव सा निर्गमं लेभे जटामण्डलमोहिता” “तच्छङ्करशिरोभ्रष्टं भ्रष्टं भूमितले पुनः । व्यरोचत तदा तोयं निर्मलं गतकल्मषम्” “It is the holy *tīrtha* that came out of the opening of the ear of *Jahnuṛshi*.” “ततो हि यजमानस्य जह्नोरद्भुतकर्मणः । ततस्तुष्टो महातेजाः श्रोत्राभ्यामसृजत्पुनः” It is the holy water which incarnated on the earth as a result of the grace of god bestowed on *Bhagīratha* for his penance. “इयं च दुहिता श्रेष्ठा तव गङ्गा भविष्यति” गङ्गा त्रिपथगा नाम दिव्या भागीरथीति च”

We come across such sayings in the stories of *Gaṅgā’*s descent \(to earth\). Among these, Lord *Brahma* is the divine entity, who keeps on performing the work of, creation while he remains unchanged.

एतन्मतं समातिष्ठ परमेण समाधिना । भवान्कल्पविकल्पेषु न विमुह्यति कर्हिचित्” ॥ “सर्वभूतमयो विश्वं ससर्जेदं स पूर्ववत्” *Mahāvishṇu* is the changeless supreme *Brāhmaṇ*. “अविकाराय शुद्धाय नित्याय परमात्मने । सदैकरूपरूपाय विष्णवे सर्वजिष्णवे” Mahādeva is *Parameśvara* \(Lord of Lords\). “विष्णुर्यथैकः पुरुषोत्तमः स्मृतः महेश्वरस्त्र्यम्बक एव नापरः” Sage *Jahnu* is a *Brahmīshṭha* who is absorbed in the bliss of meditation in the matted hair of Lord *Mahādeva. Bhagīratha* is a *Rājarshi* who by his highly astonishing penance visualized the Lord of lords, and caused the holy contact of *Gaṅgā* to his manes, to himself, and also to the world. When the flow of sentiments concerned with these great personages makes movement within us, the evil marks viz. the sins, dwelling in our dispositions get undoubtedly washed out.

###### The holy water used by great men.

From times immemorial many *Brahmajnānis*, *Satyakāmas, Satyasaṅkalpas* and *Siddhas* have taken a holy dip in this river. They, who are holy by themselves, in the pretext of making a pilgrimage to *Gaṅgā*, have consumed its water and enhanced its holiness. With the words “May the sins of those who take this water \(with devotion\) vanish,” they have added their divine will power to it. Because of this power also, the sins of people who take it persish,—“भवद्विधा भागवतास्तीर्थभूताः स्वयं विभो । तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि स्वान्तस्थेन गदाभृता” “प्रायेण तीर्थाभिगमापदेशैः स्वयं हि तीर्थानि पुनन्ति सन्तः” ।

##### Representative of Principles-a symbol

“The river of *jnāna* and *dharma* itself is the spiritual *Gaṅgā*. This is nothing but the image of God in the form of water.”-So say the *jnānis*. Also, we come across compositions of *jnānis* which express the following sense.-“The *Idā* nādī in our body is *Gaṅgā*. *Piṅgalā* is *Yamunā* and *Sushumnā* is *Sarasvatī*. And the place of confluence of these three viz. the place of meditational immersion between eyebrows \(*bhrūmadhya* is nothing but the *tīrtharājaprayāga*.”

“काशीक्षेत्रं शरीरं त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा”  
> “सेयं जलमयी मूर्तिः शिवस्य परमेशितुः”  
> धर्मस्रोतोऽवहं तीर्थं शिवं कल्मषनाशनम्”  
> “इडा भागीरथीनाम्नी पिङ्गला यमुनानदी ।  
> तयोर्मध्ये स्थिता नाडी सुषुम्नाख्या सरस्वती ॥ 

*Jnānis* have done the *tattvasamyoga* here in the ascending and descending order, in the following manner—Placing the lucid vision in the river obtained by delving deep in the above said principles, remembering those principles while taking a bath in the river, and again delving in the principles.

We come across statements in scriptures which say that all the accumulated sins will get redeemed by taking a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*. “सर्वपापहरां शिवाम्.” We also see statements such as “A person bereft of spiritual knowledge, cannot attain salvation by any means, even if he takes a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*, or performs rituals or offers great gifts. “कुरुते गङ्गासागरगमनं व्रतपरिपालनमथवा दानम् । ज्ञानविहीनः सर्वमतेन मुक्तिं न भजति जन्मशतेन” These two statements appear to be contradictory. But when seen in the background of the above *tattvasamyoga* principles, they concur with each other. Undoubtedly, the evil impressions present in our inner and outer nature get washed out and the divine knowledge in the form of bliss, and *dharma* which is its natural disposition, flow naturally in us, if *Gaṅgātīrtha* is taken with the faith that it is a spring of *jnāntattva* and *dharmatattva*.

##### The map of tattvas

Śrī Raṅgamahāguru used to expound-“The basin of Gaṅgā and the holy pilgrimages along its banks are indeed the maps drawn in the land of Bhārata by mother nature. This can be made clear by one or two examples.

Lord *Mahādeva*, who had held *Gaṅgā* captive in his head, laid her down at *Bindusaras,* to bless *Bhagīratha*. We see in the *Rāmāyaṇa* that the river branched into seven streams while descending.

विससर्ज ततो गङ्गां हरो बिंदुसरः प्रति ।  
“तस्यां विसृज्यमानायां सप्तस्रोतांसि जज्ञिरे ॥ 

ह्लादिनी पावनी चैव नलिनी च तथोऽपरा ।  
तिस्रः प्राचीं दिशं जग्मुः गङ्गागाश्शिवजलाश्शुभाः ॥ 

> सुचक्षुश्चैव सीता च सिन्धुश्चैव महानदी ।  
तिस्रस्त्वेता दिशं जग्मुः प्रतीचीं तु शुभोदकाः ।  
> सप्तमी चान्वगात्तासां भगीरथमथो नृपम् ॥” 

We can observe a map that conforms to the inner design also, in the external form of *Gaṅgā*. This *Bindu* is an effulgent principle, which can be seen only by the inner vision of the *jnānis*. And *nāda* gets manifested out of that. Then the seven *prāṇas* are created. The universe is created next.

> बिंदोर्नादसमुद्भवः समुदिते नादे जगत्कारणम्”  
> “मध्ये फालं बिन्दुर्दीप इवाभाति वर्तुलाकारः”  
“सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति” 

At the origins of river *Gaṅgā*, we come across a *tīrtha* by name *Gomukha*. This happens to be the map of the principle that is responsible for the origin of speech.

The holy places related to *Gaṅgātīrtha* such as *Brahmakapāla*, *Brahmakunḍa*, *Haridvāra* and many others, belong to this category.

On the banks of Gaṅgātīrtha we see a bathing ghat called Maṇikarṇikā in the Kāśikshetra. Śrī Śaṅkaracārya in his stotra ‘Maṇikarṇikāshṭaka says that both Gods Hara and Hari vie with each other to bestow their world to those who take a bath here. This may sound like a funny story or like an arthavāda \(exaggeration either to praise or to disparage\). But we humbly remember here the explanation bestowed by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, based on his vision of truth and dharma that it is the external form of the philosophical truth \(tāttvik satya\). “Maṇi means God, a self luminous light. The words of the Vedas and also the scholars of the past exhort this. “अन्धो मणिमविन्दत्, तमनङ्गुलिरावयत्” “चिन्तारत्नं सुलभमिह नः” “आराधयामि मणिसन्निभमात्मलिङ्गम्” There are two nādīs associated with the place of vision of that luminous light within. One nādī takes a person to the abode of Vishṇu and the other to the abode of Śiva.” This was the description graced by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru. The jnānis have given this name to it \(i.e Maṇikarṇika\) because the river Gaṅgā has formed two beds resembling the passage of these two nādīs.

Thus, *Gaṅgā* is chosen by Mother nature, as an important ‘line’ to draw the map of the abode of *tattva*. Those who take a dip at some special nodal centres of this line with their mind immersed in the divine meaning will travel in the abode of those principles only. With this, \(it can be known that\) *Gaṅgā* is giving a message to both intellectuals and sentimental people, that they should give up the path carved out by the evil, and take the path of the aforesaid maps.

In this article on *Akhshayatṛtīyā*, the discussion on the *Gaṅgā* has occupied a large part. Though this may appear to be an encroachment on the discussion of *Akshayatṛtīyā*, a lengthy analysis of *Gaṅgā* was necessitated because, this is a very important and useful matter in the study of all festivals, where the taking of the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* is prescribed. Now, we shall attempt answering some important questions regarding *Gaṅgā*, as a remaining part of this discussion.

##### The forms and features of Goddess *Gaṅgā*.

*Āgamas*, history and *purāṇas* proclaim Goddess *Gaṅgā* as a river of divine knowledge, a stream of *dharma* and an embodiment of the supreme power of the Almighty. In the *dhyānaśloka* of that river, it is described that *Gaṅgā* has a unique third eye, holds a lotus, a pot and a rosary in her hands, sports *varadamudrā*, and has a crocodile as her vehicle.

> सितमकरनिषण्णां शुभ्रवर्णां त्रिनेत्राम् ।  
> करधृतकमलाक्षां कुम्भहस्तेष्टमुद्राम् ॥ 

Are these just fantasies of a poet, or can there be a form of a deity with the above said paraphernalia? This is the first question.

##### Ordinary view
Answers coming from an ordinary vision

When viewed ordinarily, these appear to be the forms imagined by a poet. “As *Gaṅgā* is in the form of a river, a water filled pot is placed in her hand. The small quantity of water that can be filled in the *kalaśa*, later expands and flows as a great river.

“The term *tīrtha* also means *āgama* or *vidyā* \(निपानागमयोस्तीर्थं\). To suggest that the garland of letters i.e. the alphabet is the mother of all learning, the poet has presented an *akshamāla* \(rosary\) in one of her hands.

		
“As the lotus is the best of flowers born in water, a beautiful lotus has been placed in the hand of the goddess of holy water. The waves of the river are her hands. The shining fish are the many eyes of the goddess. As she is a great sustainer of the livelihood of people, she is fancied as one who sports the right hand in the blessing posture. As crocodiles abound in the river, a crocodile has been shown as her vehicle.”—Such answers come to the minds of the sentimental people.

##### Exrta-ordinary view
Answers that are perceptible to the extraordinary vision

But, when the disposition \(of a person\) is purified and the *tattvas* are pursued with an inner vision, it can be realized that they \(the form of *Gaṅgā* and the parapheralia\) are not mere imageries but sublime forms that are clearly and naturally visible in the divine ground. In the chapter *‘Devatā vigrahatattvādhikaraṇa* of the *Brahmasūtras*, the subject matter viz., whether the gods have forms or not, has been discussed, and it has been established that they do have forms. And, just because of this, one need not believe that \(gods have forms\). It should be clearly understood that they are forms which have been seen, being seen and are going to be seen, directly, by pious persons who undertake a spiritual inward journey in the body called *Brahmapura*. Also, it is not impossible that those principles and their paraphelnalia could be seen manifestly, by the will of God who is the almighty, *Satyakāma* and *Satyaksaṅkalpa*.

“They are the forms seen and described by the yogis”—these are the words of ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru the great yogi par excellence, who uttered from his own experience, and we remember them here with reverence.

The upward facing lotus which has adorned the hand of the holy *Gaṅgā*, is the thousand petalled lotus of the *yogis*. It has blossomed by the golden rays of the sun of divine knowledge. Even the *Kamanḍalu* in the shape of a lotus facing upwards held in her hand, is filled with the nectar of divine knowledge. The rosary is the canon of the universe. The beads in that are the principles under her control. Her shining eyes are not the representatives of the fickle fish. They are the steady eyes of a *jnāni*. Among them, in the middle, is the bright upward eye that is similar to the third eye in the region of the forehead of Lord *Mahādeva*.

अन्तर्लक्ष्यं बहिर्दृष्टिः निमेषोन्मेषवर्जिता ।  
> एषा सा शाम्भवी \(वैष्णवी\) मुद्रा सर्वतन्त्रेषु गोपिता ॥ 

\(Even though the eyes appear opened, the focus is inside. There is no movement of the eyelids. This is a *mudrā* called *Shāmbhavī mudrā-Vaishṇavī mudrā*, which is esoteric in all the *tantras*\)-This is precisely described in the *śāstras*. Anyhow her lotus, *Kamanḍalu*, eyes etc., have all taken the upward path, as can be seen in the words. “ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्थाः”

Now, about her vehicle *makara*. It is nothing but *avidyā*, which by its sharp jaws slashes the poor ignorant souls into pieces and devours them. But that goddesses of *vidyā*, who is an embodiment of divine knowledge, has conqured it and has transformed it as an instrument that takes the devotees to her divine abode. The *Upanishads* proclaim that ignorance can be a ladder that dismounts one to death, and can also be a boat which can make \(the souls\) to cross the \(ocean\) of death, and elevate them to immortality.

> “अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्ययामृतमान्ते”\(ईशोपनिषत्\) 

They acquire the above said second power when they come under the command of a *guru* who has a penetrating wisdom. In the present context, the *makara* which symbolizes the *avidya*, has almost obtained that capacity, as it has come under the rule of the goddess of *Vidya*. Because of the association with that goddess who is an embodiment of *Śuddhasattva* and who looks comely with her pure white complexion, even that crocodile has turned white.

##### Some problems
Some problems posed by the stories relating to *Gaṅgā*:

The *Gaṅgā* is a river which takes its birth at the top of the *Himālayas*. Let us believe that its water has the power to cure a number of ailments. But *Itihāsas, purāṇas* and *āgamas* pronounce strange statements about the river. “It is the holy water which was in the *Kamanḍalu* of *Brahma Deva.* When he \(i.e. *Brahma*\) the Lord of *Satyaloka*, washed the lotus feet of *Trivikrama Nārāyaṇa*, *Gaṅgā* took birth \(there\). There-after, she ascended the head of *Śiva* the most auspicious, and later, due to the efforts of the great ascetic *Bhagīratha*, she was made to descend to the earth and the nether worlds. She also happened to flow out of the ears of the sage *Jāhnu*. The gods took her, who was a sibling of *Umā,* to heavens for their work.” We come across such statements about her origin \(*Rāmāyaṇa* 1-53 to 65-*Śrīmadbhāgavata* 8-21\).

Many questions arise here about these stories. Are they not imaginary stories? There is no unanimity also in them. Is it true that *Gaṅgā* descended from heaven to the earth? Or Is it true that it was taken from the earth to the heaven? On the contrary, if *Gaṅgā* is a river of divine knowledge, should she not always stay in the head of lord *Śiva* a *jnāni*? Did it become empty in its origin, when it descended to earth? We hear that *Gaṅgā* became arrogant, imagining that she would even wash *Śiva* away by Jumping down on his head. Then *Śiva* arrested her in his matted hair and made her roam about there only. If so, can there be arrogance even in the power of God?

One more question invades us-*Gaṅgā* is the holy water of Lord *Vishṇu’s* feet. The statement that *Siva* bore it on his head, could be only a part of a story composed by devotee poets, to show the difference between *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*.

It has to be noted here that the solution for the questions pertaining to topics related to the visualization of *Gaṅgā* within, should be searched only in the *jnānabhūmi* and not in the sphere of intellectual gymnastic. A brief answer will be provided hereby, in the background of the upadeśa of our Gurudeva who has travelled in all the relevant spheres.

###### Brief Answers

*Śāstras* state that *Gaṅgā* is associated with the Trinity-famously known as *Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Maheshvara*.The philosophical meaning of this is that all these three gods are forms of *jnāna*, and they also bestow *jnāna*. *Gaṅgā* is the nectar of the divine knowledge filled in the vessel of the will of creation of Lord *Brahma* who is thoroughly proficient in the *Vedas*. She is the nectar of the divine knowledge dwelling in the head of Lord *Śiva*, which is the abode of *jnāna* of *Sadāśiva* who is the annihilator, super universal, and the embodiment of divine knowledge. She is the ambrosia of the nectar of the upward going lotus foot of *Urukrama*-*Trivikrama* praised by *Purushasūkta* as “पादोऽस्य विश्वा भूतानि, त्रिपादस्यामृतं दिवि” As all these three are \(different\) modes of the almighty, taking refuge in any one of these results indeed in the obtaining of *jnānāmṛta.*

The *Vaishṇava purāṅas* say that *Śiva* came to be known in the true sense of the word, on bearing *Gaṅgā* in his head, who was in the feet of *Vishṇu*. “पादोदकेन स शिवः स्वशिरोधृतेन” The purport of this is to state *Vishṇu’s* supremacy. Similarly *Śaiva Purāṇas* say that *Vishṇu* engaged himself in searching for the feet of *Śiva*. This is to state the supremacy of *Śiva*. But actually speaking, the *tattva* of the statement that *Gaṅgā* belongs to *Vishṇu’s* feet and the head of *Śiva*, should be understood in the *Yogamārga* only. The place of *Nārāyaṇa* is *Sahasrāra*. The place of *Rudradeva* is the midpoint of the eyebrows. This entire region is the abode of *jnānatīrtha* which is the redeemer. This can also be termed as, “The origin of *jnānaGaṅgā* is the feet of *Nārāyaṇa* and the head of *Śiva* is its expanse.” This is the principle here.

The feet i.e. the tread ofLord *Nārāyaṇa* who is known as *Tripadvibhūti* fills the three worlds viz *bhū*, *bhuvas* and *suvar* and crossing even them, covers the upper \(regions\). When the foot \(of *Nārāyaṇa*\) comes to the abode namely *Vyāhrti* it is natural that God *Brahma* who is its Lord, worshipped it. But the upward foot of the Lord doesn’t stop just at that place viz *Satya*, but rests in the place of supreme effulgent light \(*paranjyothi*\) proclaimed as *‘Satyasya satyam* in the *Upanishads*. This is the principle here. Our respectful *Pradakshiṇa namaskāras* to that *jnānaGaṅgā* who, after participating in the *Sṛshti*, *sthiti* and *laya* and later has positioned herself in the fourth and the superfourth state, which is beyond the commotion of those three \(viz *sṛshṭi*, *sthiti*, and *laya*\)

*Gaṅgā*, who jumped down on the head of *Śiva*, is his infinite power. Lord *Śiva* is the possessor of power. “परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च” “अखिलशक्तिधरः स्वधाम्ना” When a power competes against the sustainer of power, it has to face defeat. “तेन कोऽर्हति स्पर्धितुं” The principle that God is capable of both arresting and also releasing that power, is proclaimed by the story of *Gaṅgā* getting entrapped in the matted hair of Lord *Śiva*.

A *Brahmajnāni’s* right ear is the refuge for knowledge and also the path for the flow of currents of sound which is endowed with divine knowledge. This truth is expounded by the statement of the sages “ब्रह्मण आणी स्थः.” The story of sage *Jahnu* the king of *Jnānis* letting out *Gaṅgā* from his right ear proclaims this very same principle.

The right ear is the place by which the hearing of the current of *praṇava* is fecilitated “शृणुयाद्दक्षिणे कर्णे नादमन्तर्गतं शुभम्”

*Gaṅgā* and *Gaurī* are the two modes of divine knowledge of *Mahādeva*. They are together even in the incarnation state, as they are seen in the original state, and therefore we find them in stories as sisters and as daughters of *Himavān*.

*Gaṅgā* is the flow of *jnāna* which always adorns the head of Lord *Siva*. Sheerly to bless the people, he makes a small part of it to descend, and those who take a dip in that are rendered pure and drawn towards the origin of divine knowledge. This is the exposition of the way, by which a *mahāguru* lifts up the devotees.

When we say *Gaṅgā* is the daughter of *Himavān*, it does not mean that an inert entity called water is born of another inert entity called a mountain, as it may seem to the eyes. The purport is that the *jnānadevi* took birth as the daughter of the mountain’s reigning deity, only to bless him and to render him holy. It is also natural that gods took her back to their place for their work, after the purpose of her incarnation got accomplished. In this way, both the descent of *Gaṅgā* from the heaven to the earth, and her ascent to the heaven from the earth match well.

Thus, the stories about *Gaṅgā* found in our *Āgamas, Itihāsas* and *purāṅas* appear just like stories at first sight. But we understand that they are beautiful compositions which expound a *mahātattva* that is eternally true. Those who merge in them, get all their sense organs sanctified.

What should be done by those people who are unable to have a holy bath directly in the *Gaṅgā* on the day of *Akshaya Tṛtīya*? They should sentimentally feel that the water they are going to use for bathing is *Gaṅgātīrtha* itself. The *jnānaGaṅgā* will bestow her divine presence in that water and sanctify them.

We would like to conclude after discussing briefly, the time science and the science of other modalities pertaining to *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, and sing the epilogue for the discussion of the festival. Here *Vijnāna* means knowledge backed by discussion “विविच्य ज्ञानम्” and knowledge distinguished by the inference obtained by the study of cause and effect. “विशिष्टं ज्ञानम्”.

### The Science of Time

*Śāstras* have prescribed the third day of the *Śuklapaksha* of *Vaiśākha* which happens to be the latter half of the spring season for this festival. It should be noted that all the limbs of the above said time, happen to be highly favourable for the observance of this festival.

The distinction of *Vasanta* renowned as the king of seasons, has been explained in the discussion on *Ugādi*. Pertaining to this festival \(i.e. *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*\) it should be specially noted that grains such as barley, wheat etc., which are necessary for the worship of God and also for the offerings, arrive at homes in a ready-to-use state, in this season.

It is not certain that all those grains in the ripened state arrive at homes in *caitra,* the first month of *Vasanta*. But by *Vaiśākha* they will have surely arrived at homes. As *Vishuvat parva* also occurs in this month, it is a month which is best both for the worship of gods and *pitṛs*.

*Śāstras* say that the entire six months of *Uttarāyaṇa* is the day time for *devas* and the *śuklapaksha* especially is time of their delight and nourishment. In addition to this, if festivals like *Sankramaṇa* and *AkshyaTṛtīyā* also occur, they will be dear to *pitṛs* also. The time that is dear to both of them \(i.e. gods and *pitṛs*\) is the time when the centers connected with them in the temple of the human body blossom. And it is the time when nature gets specially propitious and takes those who worship at that time to the grace of gods easily and swifly. This need not be believed just because a statement is made to that effect. Those who honestly undertake that worship can experience it at the distinct time. The *Tṛtīyā* of this festival is also known by the appropriate name *“Jayā”*. Particularly the *Tṛtīyā of śuklapaksha* is still more auspicious.

> नन्दा भद्रा जया रिक्ता पूर्णाः स्युस्तिथयः पुनः ।  
> पर्यायत्वेन विज्ञेया नेष्टमध्येष्टदा सिते ॥ 

		
And if the *Tṛtīyā* which is associated with the all auspicious *Gauri,* and the *caturthī* associated with *vighnādhipa Gaṇeśa* come together, it becomes a festival of great accomplishments.

### Modalities \(of worship\)

**Worship of God:** It is a part of *Nityakarma* to worship god mentally and also to worship in detail externally, in keeping with the grandeur of the festival. Sandal paste and barley are specially prescribed for offering to god during worship on *Akshaya Tṛtīya*. Let us now discuss the appropriateness of those two \(prescribed\) for offering.

यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनभूषितम् ।  
> अर्पयेद्धान्यराजं च स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ 

One who decorates Lord *Kṛshṇa* with sandal paste on *Tṛtīyā* and offers him barley the king of cereals, he will attain *Vaikunṭha*. As *akshaya tṛitīyā* falls in the latter part of *Vasanta* which is very close to *Grīshma*, some *śāstra* texts term it as summer season only.

वैशाखज्येष्ठौ ग्रीष्मः \(सुश्रुतसूत्र 6-10\) 

Whatever may be the definition of the month, it is a time of strong currents of wind, and the body gets dry because of increase in temperature in nature due to sun’s heat, and thirst increases. Sandal paste controls all these detriments.

> चन्दनं शीतलं रूक्षं तिक्माह्लादनं लघु ।  
श्रमदोषविषश्लेष्मतृष्णापित्तास्रदाहनुत्” ॥\(भावप्रकाश-कर्पूरादिवर्ग\) 

\(*Śrīgandha* provides cooling effect, is fragrant, drying, bitter, delightful and light. It relieves tiredness, dryness, toxic effects, phlegm, thirst, *raktapitta* and burning sensation.\)

Sandal paste in one among the important substances offered in the external worship of God. *Pūjakalpas* consider it very auspicious in using it for smearing on idols of God and for the offering of *abhisheka* with it’s water. Though there are many substances with good fragrance, sandal paste is considered best among them and also as the one very dear to Goddess *Śrīdevi* and thus it is called *‘Śrīgandha’*. As it is also delightful, it is called *‘candana’* \(*cadi āhlādane*\)’ In addition to this, there is an element in the *Śrīgandha* which provides inspiration to get divine feelings, when offered in the freshly ground state for worship. When a piece of *Śrīgandha* is being ground on the stone, the pure sandal \(paste\) obtained after the upper layer of dirt is removed, gets ready for offering in the worship of God. In this aspect, *Śrīgandha* reminds us of a Yogic experience, in which, due to the churning or grinding in the form of *dhyāna*, the bad *vāsanās* of the mind surface first in the upper layers \(of the mind\), and after they vanish, as the mind gets near *‘Mānasaspati’* the Almighty who is deep inside, good *vāsanas* appear and get offered to God. That’s why a great *yogi* by name *Śathāri* prays to God with the words, ‘Lord, My mind is the sandal to anoint you. *Pūśum Sāndum Neñjame’*.

The words

> यथा चन्दनागर्वादेः उदकादिसम्बन्धजक्लेदादिजमौपाधिकम्  
> दौर्गन्ध्यं तत्स्वरूपनिघर्षणेन आच्छाद्यते स्वेन पारमार्थिकेन गन्धेन” 

in the *Īśāvasyabhāshya* of *Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavatpāda* may be remembered here. We also humbly remember here the words of Śrīraṅgamahāguru, who said “we have to grind our lives, like the stump of sandal wood, in the service of the Almighty.”

A question arises in the mind of laymen here. Let us agree with the view of *Āyurveda* that *Śrīgandha* is a great subtance and we should apply it on the body during festivals. The ailments of the body are removed by that and the mind gets delighted. O.K. But why should it be applied on the idol of God who is free from ailments and who is unattached? Why should it \(i.e. the idol\) be given a sandal water bath?’ This question may invade the mind. The answer to this should be gathered with discrimination. God has no need of this offering of sandal \(paste\). The *Upanishads* declare him as *‘Agandha’* and *‘Sarvagandha’* as well.

So, keeping aside the thought that the sandal paste is meant for ‘we people’ who are stained with blemishful dispositions and when offered with a pure mind to God who is *Nityaśuddha* and *Nirañjana* and taken as *prasāda* after that, it becomes most divinely enjoyable because, the *Śrīgandha* here gets associated with *Brahmagandha* also. Ailments of both the body and the mind get removed. The *Bhogadravya* becomes a *yogadravya*. We are transported to pure piousness, because of an upward proclivity. It is for this intent, it should be offered to God.

Also, when sandal paste is applied to the great *Sāligrama* or a *Śivalinga*, it’s inherent quality increases further by their contact. And when one takes it with the sentiment of *prasāda*, he obtains both *śreyas* and *preyas*.

Now about barley. “It is the king among cereals” say the *śāstras*. \(*Yavosi Dhānyarājosi*\). In *Śrīmad Bhāgavatha*, Lord *Kṛshṇa* tells *Uddhava*. “I am barley among grains.” \(*Oshadhīnāmaham Yavah*\).

यवः कषायो मधुरः शीतलो लेखनो मृदुः ।  
> कण्ठत्वगामयश्लेष्मपित्तमेदः प्रणाशनः ॥  
> पीनसश्वासकासोरुस्तम्भलोहिततृट्प्रणुत् ॥ 

\(It is astringent, sweet, cool and tender. It is a panacea for throat pain, skin diseases, phlegm, acidity and obesity. It cures diseases like catarrh, breathing problem, cough, pain in the muscles of the thigh, diseases of blood and thirst.\) Thus the *Ayurveda* describes the qualities of barley. Consumption of this in the seasons of *Vasanta* and *Grīshma* proves highly beneficial.

Using such a great substance just to gratify our senses is beastliness. It is right conduct for humans to offer it at least on the day of an auspicious festival to *Hṛshīkeśa* \(the Lord of our *Indriyas*, and *Paśupathi* \(Lord of all living beings\) and take it as *prasāda*.

		
**2\) *Pitṛ Pūja.*** “The word *Pitṛ* means one’s father and the ancestors in the family. One should serve them as long as they are alive. This itself is *pitṛpūja* or *pitṛyajna*. Other than this, performing *śrāddha* after death and offering of *tarpaṇa* etc are nothing but blind belief.”—some people say. It is better to treat this topic in a separate chapter called *Pitṛyajna.* For the time being, we wish to state that the *pitṛs* are a class of deities. *Vasu*, *Rudra*, *Āditya*, *Kavyavāhana*, *Agnishvātta* are some of the other names of *pitṛs*. Just as *Brahma* and other gods are to be worshipped with modalities in a distinct time, they \(the *pitṛs*\) also are to be worshipped in a distinct time with modalities. Those who worship them accordingly, will be duly bestowed with desired things. The word *pitṛ* also denotes the father, grand father and the great grand father. No doubt, they should be served. But, they should not be mistaken for *‘Pitṛdevatās’* in the context of *‘Pitṛyajna’* where that word \(i.e. *Pitṛdevatās*\) is used in the technical sense. This is our humble request.

Persons supposed to offer *tarpaṇa* and *pinḍapradān*a to the *pitṛdevatās* on the day of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, will be graced by them.

**3\) *Dāna:*** *Śāstras* state that gifts are to be made after worship of gods and *pitṛ devatās*. This concept of *dāna* also requires a detailed discussion in a separate chapter. This has been alluded to in the introductory section also. For the time being a few important points may be remembered in brief.

The term *dāna* referred to here is not one of the four *upāyas* \(means of success\) namely *sāma, dāna, bheda* and *danḍa* in the path of the work-a-day world. It is an humble gift conforming to the *śāstras*, made either with the pure thought of making an offering to God or with a wish for the accomplishment of desires. Lord \(*Kṛshṇa*\) proclaims this as *‘Pāvana’* like *yajna* and *tapas*.

> यज्ञो दानं तपश्यैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् 

*Śrīmadbhāgavata* lauds this as a means of *dravyaśuddhi*. *Srutis* also praise the glory of this—“शुद्ध्यन्ति दानैः सन्तुष्ट्या द्रव्याणि” “यज्ञेन दानेन तपसा अनाशकेन” “तस्माद्दानं परमं वदन्ति” *Śāstras* state “Those who do not gift in the form of *dāna*, but enjoy pleasures for themselves will meet with misfortunes. The one who gives-away, benefits greatly.”

Here a question arises in the minds of laymen-“True, the person who receives the gifts is benefited. But the donor who parts with the gift, obviously stands as the loser. No gain is seen on his part, isn’t it?” We would like to briefly answer this in the words of *jnānis*. They say-“If a person gives-away with either hypocrisy or insolence, or makes a gift not conforming to regulations of the *śāstras*, or in the wrong place or time, or to a wrong person, such a gift does not fetch any good result. But if done in the proper place and time to a proper person, it does fetch great rewards. Such a gift takes the form of the highly valuable *‘puṇya’*, and goes on increasing in the mind-bank of a person, and in the opportune time, yields results thousand fold to the donor.” This is our concise answer. The matter of *puṇya* and *pāpa* has been already explained previously, in the discussion on the topic of *Gaṅgāsnāna*.

The substance offered as a gift should be good and pleasing. The *Kaṭhopanishad* decries an arrogant person who gave a gift of old and non-milch cows which could not even eat fodder or drink water. \(*Katha*-Chap 1\). People void of judgement have created niggardly words such as coconuts of *dāna*, ghee of *homa* etc. This is indeed undoubtedly reprehensible.

Places such as a holy place of pilgrimage, a temple, and a *yajnabhūmi* are some of the best places for giving gifts. Times such as the time of eclipses and nodal times like *saṅkrāntis* are the best times for giving gifts. A *Brahmajnāni*, a *śrotriya*, a man with a large family, a poor person, a weak person, a person in danger etc., are all the most deserving ones for gifts, in keeping with propriety. In this way making right gifts at the suitable time, place, and to the deserving ones with discrimination, brings in amazingly huge rewards.

*Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is also one such excellent timefor making gifts. The special things that are prescribed for gifting on that day are barley powder, fried barley, Bengalgram, curd rice, water and a *pūrṇakumbha*. Among these we have already noted the greatness of barley. Likewise the dry fried powder of barley is also excellent.

> यवजाः सक्तवः शीताः दीपना लघवः सराः ।  
> कफपित्तहरा रूक्षा लेखनाश्च प्रकीर्तिताः ॥ 

> ते पीता बलदा हृष्या बृंहणा मेदनास्तथा ।  
> तर्पणा मधुरा रूक्षाः परिणामे बलावहाः ॥ 

> कफपित्तश्रमक्षुत्तृट्व्रणनेत्रामयापहाः ।  
> प्रशस्ता घर्मदाहाध्वव्यायामार्तशरीरिणाम्”\(भावप्रकाश-कर्पूरादिवर्ग\) 

The dry fried powder of barley causes a cooling effect, improves digestion, is light, clears wastes from the body, removes phleghm and *pitta,* and is dry. When consumed, it provides strength, happiness, increase in virility and fat. Causes satisfaction, sweetness, and results in the increase of stamina. It removes *Kaphapitta*, exhaustion, hunger, thirst and heals wounds, and is curative of eye diseases. The science of medicine praises its quality as one which is excellent for people who are worn out with the thirst of summer and travel. Gifting of such an excellent substance in the hot summer yields a great reward and so there is no need to explain the propriety of that time \(for gifting\). It is very clear that gifting of curd rice and water in summer, is also most proper. The merit of bengalgram has been already described in the discussion of *Hanumajjayanti*.

A little elaboration needs to be provided pertaining to the gift of *pūrnakumbha*. Gifting of cold water and a vessel filled with it in summer, becomes highly useful to all. Even common sense tells that highly useful things when gifted result in great *puṇya*. But in the vision of *jnānis*, this *pūrṇakumbha* is one which is filled with the riches of divine wealth also. It is suggestive of the supreme entity who is complete and an embodiment of nine *rasas*, as is evident from the words of the *śṛutis*.

“ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते । पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते”

It is also an image of the supreme *yogi* who is completely immersed in HIM. The silence of the *Kumbha* which is filled with water, is also symbolic of the great quietness of a *Yogi* in *Samādhi* who is a *Rasapūrṇa*. It also reminds us of the stillness of the *Kumbhakayoga* which is a form of complete arrest of the *praṇa* and *Apāṇa*. The shape of the *kumbha* being narrow at the bottom, wide in the center and again narrow at the top, represents the cosmos that is subject to creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe, and the principle of *Trimūrti* carried out by God. We can see this meaning in the *ślokas* of the *mantras* recited during *Kalaśapūja*.

Not that the *Purṇakumbha* has only this wealth of meaning in the eyes of the *jnānis*; even the sight or touch of such a pot can remove sufferings and can cause bliss. Worshipping of such a *pūrṇakumbha* as per modalities in the nodal time of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā,* and gifting it to the deserving person during worship, yields inexhaustible results undoubtedly.

**4\) One time fasting:**We shall discuss this topic while deliberating on the observance of *Prathamaikādaśī*. Some people may object—* “Akshaya Tṛtīyā* is not a big festival. Ours is a poor country. We cannot afford to celebrate it.” They should understand that the benefit of celebrating of the festival accrues to them, even if they take up meditation and worship of god in the available time, if they cannot afford to celebrate the festival. Thus, if the *Akshaya Tṛtīyā* festival is celebrated in keeping with the science of time, materials and modalities pertaining to that day, imperishable results will be obtained in the true sense. When even the intellectual science pertaining to this can bestow brilliance and tranquility in us, what doubt can be there in \(the truth\) that it yields imperishable benefits when it is brought into practice? Many salutations to the glory of the *jnāna* and *vijnāna* of the *guruparamātman* who resides in the *guha.* Only because of that,\(glory\), the benefit of the above said *jnānavijnāna* has been obtained by us.



## Anantapadmanābha Vrata  
\(Anantana Caturdaśī-Anantana Habba\)

**The *Āradhya Deva* of this *Anantana Vrata***

*Ananta Padmanābha Vrata* is one of the auspicious *parvas* observed by a vast number of *sanātana Ārya Bhāratīyas*. It is called *AnantanaVrata* as it is a day of austerity of deity worship, and many precepts of *Vratas* have to be followed on that day. The term *Ananta* means ‘king of serpents’, and also *Ādiśesha* the *Śeshanāga*.

“शेषोऽनन्तो नागराजः”

The meaning of the component parts of this term is ‘the one who has no end’. *Ādiśesha* has this name because he is the form of the *prāṇaśakti* \(*Kuṅḍalini*\) of the Lord, who has infinite power.

This term *Ananta* also refers to the the great Lord *Ādinārāyaṇa* who is a *Śeshī* for this endless *Śeshanāga*, whom the Lord has employed \(in his service\) as a couch, a seat, an adornment, the royal white umbrella, a jewel lamp and *Pādukā* \(Sandal\)

“नमोऽस्त्वनन्ताय सहस्रमूर्तये” As his \(i.e. *Śeshanāga’s*\) forms, qualities, powers and glories are all endless, this word \(*Ananta*\) befits him also.

“अनन्तवीर्यामृतविक्रमस्त्वम्”

“अनन्त”is the name in short of that *Nārāyaṇa* the Lord of Lords, who is called *Anantaśayana* as he has made *Anantanāga* his couch, and is also called *Anantapadmanābha,* as he has the navel which is the origin of *Brahma*.

There are three types among the idols of *Nārāyaṇa* who rests on *Anantanāga*. The first one is *Raṅganātha*. He has only two arms. He has no weapons in his hands. He has neither the lotus projecting out of his navel nor Lord *Brahma* on it. The Lord is in the posture of deep sleep placing one of this arms as a pillow. This idol can be seen in *ŚriRaṅgam, Śriraṅgapattaṇam. Śivanasamudra, Raṅgasthala* and some other places.

The second one is *Govindarāja*. He has four arms. He has *śankha*, *cakra* and *gadā* in three hands. The other arm is stretched \(forward\). He is in the posture of having eyes partially opened just after getting up from sleep. *Brahma* is seen sitting on the lotus flower. *Madhu* and *Kaiṭabha* are seen sitting at his lotus feet with folded hands. One can have the *darśan* of this *Govindarāja* in *Govindarājapattaṇa* which is at the foot of *Tirumala* \(*Tirupati*\), and in the *Sannidhi* opposite to that of Lord *Naṭarāja* of the *Cidambara* temple of *Cidambaram*, and in *Kalkunṭe* which is near *Chikkatirupati* \(which is\) near Bangalore.

The third is *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. He has two arms. Of them, the left arm is raised holding a downward faced lotus at the level of his neck. In the outstretched right lower arm, he appears to be covering a *śivaliṅga*. The Lord is shining in the posture of gracing the sages who are wishing him *Suprabhātam* with his broad eyes, just after waking up from *Yoganidrā*.

> योगनिद्रान्तविशदैः पावनैरवलोकनैः ।   
> भृग्वादीननुगृहणन्तं सौख्यशायिनिकानृषीन् ॥ 

The four faced *Brahma* is beaming in the *Padmāsana* posture in the lotus navel of the Lord. One can see this idol in *Tiruvanantapuram*. The *dhyānaśloka* is as follows:—

> श्रीकृष्णं क्षेत्रपालं ध्वजबलिसहितं भूतनाथं नृसिह्मम्   
> व्यासम् शम्भुं गणेशं रघुवरमनुजं जानकीं वायुपुत्रम् ।   
> विष्वक्सेनं सुपर्णं सुरमुनिकमलाभूमिब्रह्मादिसेव्यम्   
> वन्दे श्रीपद्मनाभं परमपदमहोपन्नगाभोगसुप्तम् ॥ 

I salute *Padmanābha* the Lord of the highest abode who is resting on *Anantaśeshanāga*, and who is being attended by *SrīKṛshṇa, Kshetrapālaka, Dhvajabali, Bhūtanātha, Śāstā, Yogānṛsimha, Vyāsa, Śiva, Gaṇeśa, ŚrīRāmaśītā Lakshmaṇa, Hanumanta Vishvaksena, Garuḍa, devatās, sages, ŚrīDevi, Bhūdevi* and *Brahmadeva*, *Sanakādisiddhas, Tumburu Nāradas, Saptarshis, Sūrya* and *Candra, Dikpālakas*, and *Jaya Vijayas*. As all these three are *Śeshanāga Anantamūrtis*, who among the three should be meditated upon and worshipped during *Anantana Vrata*? It is the third one i.e. *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. \(*Ananta* is also the short form of *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*\)

### When should this Anantana Vrata be celebrated?

This *Vrata* should be observed on the *caturdaśi* of *Bhādrapada śuddha*. This *vrata* should be observed even if *caturdaśī* prevails to the extent of just three *muhūrtas* at sunrise.

“उदये त्रिमुहूर्तापि ग्राह्यानन्तव्रते विधिः” “मध्याह्ने भोज्यवेलायाम्”

In all the *Vratas*, the *tithi* should extend till the afternoon.

A scholar by name *Divodāsa* says—

“पूजाव्रतेषु मध्याह्नव्यापिनी तिथिः”

If *caturdaśī* prevails atleast for one *muhūrthakāla* on *Bhādrapada pūrṇima*, it should be considered as *pūrṇa tithi* and *ŚrīVishṇu Pūja* should be performed—

“मुहूर्तमपि चेद्भाद्रे पूर्णिमायां चतुर्दशी । सम्पूर्णांतां विदुस्तस्यां पूजयेद्विष्णुमव्ययम्” \(*Skānda purāṇa*\)

The *Bhavishya Purāṇa* says:

> तथा भाद्रपदस्यान्ते चतुर्दश्यां द्विजोत्तम ।   
> पौर्णमास्याः समायोगे व्रतं चानन्तकं चरेत् ॥ 

“If *caturdaśī* is there at least for a duration of one *muhūrta, Ananta caturdaśī* should be celebrated on that day itself” says a treatise by name *Nirṇayāmṛta*. But, as per the axim “सन्दिग्धेष्वेकवाक्यत्वात्”, it is mandatory to observe *AnantaVrata* on *Caturdasī tithi* if it prevails either at the beginning or at the end of the afternoon. This is the conclusion stated in the treatise *Nirṇayasindhu*.

### How to celebrate the *Vrata*?

*Saṅkalpa* to perform this *vrata* should be done after bath and *ācamana*. And a *saṅkalpa* should be done for performing *YamunāPūja,* which is a part of the *Anantavrata*. \(This *yamunā pūja* should be performed by the side of a river, a lake or a pond or even near a well\)

> लोकपालस्तुतां देवीम् इन्द्रनीलसमप्रभाम् ।   
> यमुने त्वामहं ध्याये सर्वकामार्थसिद्धये ॥ 

> क्षीरोदार्णवसम्भूते क्षीरवर्णोपशोभिते ।   
> प्रसन्ना भव मे देवि यमुने ते नमो नमः ॥ 

And, as a part of the *Yamunāpūja*, the worship of \(the following viz\) *Tuṅga* who is *Sūryapādābjasambhūtā*, the dark hued *Kṛshṇaveṇi*, *Nandipādā, Bhīmarathī, Godāvari* river, deities and *Gaṅgadevī* should be performed. *Yamunādevī* should be worshipped with flowers. After the *Aṅgapūjā*, *nāmapūjā*, and *ashṭottaranāmapūjās* to *Yamunā* are performed, *uttarārādhana* should be done. All the services such as *Dhūpa, dīpa* etc should be offered. And river *Yamunā* should be praised \(with the sloka\):—

> विगाहे यामुनं तीर्थं साधु बृन्दावने स्थितम् ।   
> निरस्तजिह्मगस्पर्शे यत्र कृष्णः कृतादरः ॥ 

The worshipped *Kalaśa* which is filled with the water of *Yamunānadī—devī* who is the daughter of the Sun god, and sister of *Yamadharmarāja,* and who is dearest to *Padmanābha ŚrīKṛshṇa*, should be taken home along with *Maṅgalavādyas*. The *tīrtha* in the *Kalaśa* should to be added to the *Pūjākalaśa* of Lord *Ananta* and, on that \(*Kalaśa*\) the *darbha* knot, clothes, coconut and flowers should be arranged decoratively. That *darbha* knot should be in the shape of a seven hooded snake.

### Worship of *AnantaPadmanābha*

The number fouteen is a fixed number very dear to *AnantaPadmanābha*. The day of his *pūja* is the fourteenth day of *Śuklapaksha*. The number of knots in the thread in which is he invoked, should be fourteen etc. After invoking Lord *Ananta* in both the *Kalaśas*, the following should be done viz *saṅkalpa, Sarvopacārapūja Kalaśapūja, Praṇapratishṭhā, Dvārapālādiparivārapūjā, Dikpālaka pūjā, aṅga pūjā, pūjā* with leaves and flowers \(even red coloured flowers are best\), invoking *śesha* in fourteen darbha knots, *śeshapūja*, *Pūja* of fourteen *doragranthis*. and āvāhana. After *āvāhana*, these fourteen *granthi devatās* \(deities of knots\) viz., *Vishṇu, agni*, *Sūrya*, *Indra, Brahma, Vāyu, Śiva, Vighneśa, Skanda, Soma, Ākaśa, Varuṇa, Pṛthvi* and *Vasus* should be worshipped. And then *pūjā* should be done with *nāmāvalis* and *Ashṭtottara Śatanāmāvalis* addressing *Ananta*.

*AnantaPadmanābha* can be worshipped in a *kumbha* and also in a *manḍala*, an idol, or even in a picture. He can also be meditated upon and worshipped in the abovesaid form, as seen in *Tiruvanantapuram*. Or, he can be meditated upon and worshipped in the form, where he is seen resting on the seven hooded *Ādiśesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*, Four armed holding a lotus in his right hand and a conch in the lower right hand, a disc in the left hand and the mace in the lower left hand, and attended by *Śrī, Bhū* and *Nīlādevīs*, servants like *Garuḍa*, deities, sages like *Sanaka* and the seven sages such as *Bhṛgu* etc. The *dhyānaśloka* \(for that worship\) is as follows:

> कृत्वा दर्भमयं देवं वारांनिधिसमप्रभम् ।   
> फणसप्तान्विते सर्पे पिङ्गलाक्षं चतुर्भुजम् ॥ 

> दक्षिणाग्रकरे चक्रं गदां तस्याप्यधःकरे ।   
> शङ्खमूर्ध्वकरे वामे पद्मं तस्याप्यधःकरे ॥ 

> दधानं सर्वलोकेशं सर्वाभरणभूषितम् ।   
> दुग्धाब्धिमध्ये संस्थाप्य तत आवाहयेत् सुधीः ॥ 

The Lord is resting on a seven headed *Śesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*. He is dark complexioned, has four shoulders, holds five weapons such as *Śankha* and *cakra*. He is being served by *Garuḍa* and *Vishvaksena*, and is accompanied by *Śrī-Bhū-Nīlā Devīs*, and *Dvārapālakas*. He is worshipped by *Brahma, Indra* and other *devatās*. He is attended upon by *Siddhas* like *Sanaka* etc and seven sages like *Bhṛgu* etc. He holds a disc in the upper right hand and a mace in the lower one, a conch in the upper left hand and a lotus in the lower one. He should be offered *Shoḍaśopacāras* in detail. Also, pūja of fourteen *āvaraṇa devatās*, *pūja* with fourteen *patras* and fourteen *pushpas*, and *pūja* with fourteen *doragranthis* should be offered to him. Fourteen types of *bhakshyas* \(eatables\) should be offered to him. They are—

1. *puri unḍe* 
2. *pullangāyi unḍe* 
3. *Tuṇitenkoḷalu* 
4. *araḷunḍe*, 
5. *Cakkuli* 
6. *Thenkoḷalu*, 
7. *muccore*, 
8. *Kāyi obbattu* 
9. *Sajjappa*. 
10. *Āmbode*. 
11. *Kārāseve* 
12. *Kobbari Miṭhāyi* 
13. *Kadubu* 
14. *Atirasa* 
15. Butter \(mixed with saffron, Cardamon and sugar\) and, 
16. beaten rice mixed with jaggery. \(beaten rice should be prepared at home with purity\) 

Each one of these items should be prepared in twenty eight numbers and after offering them to God, fourteen from each of the items should be offered to *ṛthviks*. The rest fourteen should be retained as *prasāda*. And, the services viz *tambūla samarpaṇa*, *uttara nīrājana*, *arghya*, *pradakshiṇa* and *namaskāra* should be offered.

Then, new *doragrahaṇa* \(is done next\), reciting the *śloka*

> अनन्तकामदं देव सर्वपापप्रणाशन ।   
अनन्तदोररूपेण पुत्रपौत्रान्प्रवर्धय ॥   
> अनन्तसंसारमहासमुद्रे मग्नं समभ्युद्धर वासुदेव ।   
> अनन्तरूपिन् विनियोजयस्व ह्यनन्तसूत्राय नमो नमस्ते ॥ 

And saluting God, the *dora* should be tied to the right wrist. The following *śloka* is chanted during *dorabandhana*:

> संसारगह्व्रगुहासु सुखं विहर्तुं   
> वाञ्छन्ति ये कुरुकुलोद्भव शुद्धसत्त्वाः ।   
> सम्पूज्य च त्रिभुवनेशमनन्तदेवम्   
> बध्नन्ति दक्षिणकरे वरदोरकं ते ॥ 

The worn out old *dora* should be discarded chanting

> नमस्ते सर्वदेवाय विश्वरूपधराय च ।   
> सूत्रगन्थिषु संस्थाय अनन्ताय नमो नमः ॥ 

The last part of the *Vrata* is *upāyana dāna*. \(The *Kalaśa* of *Āvāhana*, *vastra*, *dakshiṇā* and half of the *naivedya* offered to God should given as *dāna* to *srotriyas*\)

> गृहाणेदं द्विजश्रेष्ठ वायनं दक्षिणायुतम् ।   
> त्वत्प्रसादात् व्रती देव मुच्यते कर्मबन्धनात् ॥   
> अनन्तः प्रतिगृणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> अनन्तस्तारकोभाभ्यां अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The hymn *“Devasyatvā”* should be chanted while offering the *dāna,* and also during the *Pratigraha*. *Pūjā* should be performed again. And *Anusandhāna* should to be done with the wish that Lord *Anantapadmanābha* may become pleased, graceful and may grant boons.

“अनया पूजया भगवान् सर्वात्मकः अनन्तपद्मनाभः सुप्रीतः सुप्रसन्नो वरदो भवतु”

The story of *AnantaVrata* should be listened to, after the worship.

An important point to be taken note of regarding *Ananta Vrata* is that the number fourteen is significant in this *Vrata*. The day of his *vrata* is *Caturdaśī*. The number of knots in the threads that are tied to the hand in his worship is fourteen. The number of deities in the *Āvaraṇapūja* is fourteen. The number of leaves, flowers and items for *Naivedya* are all fourteen. *Udyāpana* is also after fourteen years. This unique number is symbolic of the fact that the entire universe consisting of the fourteen worlds is under his unabridged reign. *Ādiśesha* who happens to be his couch is *Ananta*. He \(i.e. *Ādiśesha*\) is adored with infinite qualities and endowed with endless power and is totally *Śeshabhūta* to *Anantapadmanābha*. Remaining in close proximity to him, he happens to be the foremost recipient of his *Śeshaprasāda*.

***“Garuḍa* and serpants are enemies by birth. But in the vicinity of *Ananthapadmanābha,* both are friendly and are completely at his service. *Garuḍa* is not gandering at his wings and *Śeshanāga* is not worried about his hoods. Because, the gazes of both of them are fixed at *Nārāyaṇa* who is the eternally blissful Lord.”—These were the words of *Śrī Gurudeva* pertaining to this.** *Kālidāsa* also describes this as “मुक्तशेषविरोधेन”. \(“The one who has not an iota of enemity with *Ādiśesha*”\) *Nāgasarpas* are of different colours and kinds. But this *Nāgarāja Ādiśesha* is pure white in complexion, as described by the *aḷvārs* who were greatest devotees. “Vellattaravil tuyil amarndavittinai”. He is of pure bright white colors is of pure bright white colors is full of pure *Sattvaguṇa*, and not a smidgen of *rajas* and *tamas* is found in him. This *Anantanāgarāja* has one thousand hoods.

The *purāṇas* say that this entire earth is perched on one of his thousand hoods, like a mustard grain. In the images and pictures in temples, he is seen with five or seven hoods. Which is this strange \(imaginary\) serpent?

One may say no such snake carrying the earth is seen around. Yes, it is not the physical serpent. This *Śeshasarpa* is the very *Kunḍalinī Śakti* which is described in *Yogaśastra* and visualized by *jnānis*. As it has countless *Vrttis*, it is called as a thousand hooded serpent, say the *jnānis.* The *jnānis* who witness it say that the *Prāṇaśakti* \(*Kunḍalini*\) in our *pinda* \(body\) which has five *vṛttis* such as *prāṇa, Apāna* etc. or seven *Vṛttis,* is itself *Ādiśesha* as expressed in “सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति”. That is why the *Ādiśesha* who is both the couch and umbrella etc to the Lord, is shown as a five hooded or a seven hooded serpent. One can see this *Śeshanāga* whom the *yogis* who are *jnānis* have seen with the *Jnanadṛshṭi* and described, only after obtaining the inner eye.

*Yogis* see this *AnantaPadmanābha* who rests on this *Anantanāga*. We wish that the external worship offered to Lord *Padmanābha* helps us to obtain the *Yogadṛshṭi* and *Jnānadrshṭi* which are needed for that.

We noted that as per precepts, fourteen pairs of *Bhakshaṇas* should to be prepared and offered as *Naivedya* in the worship of *Ananta*. What should one do if he cannot afford to prepare so many *Bhakshaṇas*? It will be O.K. even if one item among them viz. *Sajjappa* is prepared and offered. God will be pleased even if fruits are offered. Those who can afford, many prepare all of them in fourteen numbers which is a mystrical, significant number and offer them for the awakening of the spiritual centres, and for bliss.

It is prescribed that at the end of the *Pūjā*, half of the things used for the worship of God viz the pot, the idol, clothes and the *Bhakshaṇa* and *Naivedya* etc., should be gifted to *Srotriyas*.

But, eligible recepients who are austere, do not \(generally\) receive \(any gifts\) from others. In such a case, without finding out whether a person is *satpātra* or *apātra*, can those things be gifted as *dāna* to anyone that comes by at that moment?

No. A *dāna* should be given to *satpātras* only. *Dāna* should be made after meditating upon God and with the sentimental feeling that all the items of gift are *Brahmasvarūpas*. The *dāni* also should receive it with the same *Brahambhāva*. Divine observances should be completed without any blemish touching anyone on both the sides. It is for this very reason, the following *sloka*, the purport of which is, “everything is *Anantapadmanābha Svarūpam”* should be chanted and reflected upon.

> अनन्तः प्रतिगृहणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> द्वयोश्च तारकोऽनन्तः अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The person who receives the *dāna* is also *Ananta*, the person who gives it is also *Ananta* and the divine force that helps the two to attain salvation is also *Ananta*. We salute Lord *Ananta* again and again.





	 
## Cāturmāsya

### 1. Importance of *cāturmāsya*

Though the name *cāturmāsya* is familiar to many of us in the row of *vratas*, there is an impression that it is related to monks and some *Maḍi hengasaru* \(some women in the olden days who were very orthodox\) and people belonging to the other *Āśramas* need not consider it. This is a result of misunderstanding. From the view point of *śāstras* this is a *parva* that should be observed by everyone. This does not belong either to the category called *naimittika karma*, a rite which should be performed because of a *nimitta;* Or a *kāmya karma* a rite which is performed only for the fulfillment of a specific desire, which need not be observed otherwise. It happens to be a *nitya karma* only, as it belongs to a category in which certain rituals are mandatory at some distinct times, and the blemish of sinfulness may occur if they are not observed. There is no doubt that it must be specially observed by *sanyāsis*. But the *śāstras* say that is the duty of all i.e. people belonging to all *Āśramas,* to observe it to the extent possible.

> चत्वार्येतानि नित्यानि चतुराश्रमवर्णिनाम् ।   
> नित्यान्येतानि विप्रेन्द्र व्रतान्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ \(स्कान्दपुराण\) 

The *Mahābhārata* proclaims that if this *vrata* is not observed, one will be stuck with the sins of the whole year.

> वार्षिकांश्चतुरो मासान् वाहयेत् केनचिन्नरः ।   
> व्रतेन नोचेदाप्नोति किल्बिषं वत्सरोद्भवम् ॥ 

### 2. Names and their etymology:

As this *vrata* comes regularly for a period four months every year. it is called *‘cāturmāsya’*. \(*“Caturshu māseshu bhavah”*\). As all the four months of observance are the months of rainy season, it is called *“Varshartu Vrata”* also.

### 3. Description of the time of observance:

This *vrata* should be begun on the day of *ekādaśī* or *dvādaśī* or *pūrṇimā* of the bright half of *Āshādha māsa*. It must be begun either on the days of *karkāṭaka saṅkramaṇa* or, in case of difficulties, on the day of *Tulā saṅkramaṇa*. Whatever may be the day it is begun, it should be concluded on the day of *utthāna dvādaśī*.

> आषाढशुक्लद्वादश्यां पौर्णमास्यामथापि वा ।   
> चातुर्मास्यव्रतारम्भं कुर्यात् कर्कटसङ्क्रमे ।   
> अभावे तु तुलार्केऽपि मन्त्रेण नियमं व्रती ॥ \(वराह पुराण\) 

चातुर्मास्यव्रतग्रहणे कालचतुष्टयम् -आषाढी   
> पौर्णमासी शुक्लाएकादशी द्वादशी कर्काटक   
> सङ्क्रान्तिश्च” समाप्तिस्तु द्वादश्यामेव ।   
> चतुर्धा गृह्य वै चीर्णं चातुर्मास्यव्रतम् नरम्   
> कार्तिके शुक्लपक्षे तु द्वादश्यां तत्समापयेत् ॥ \(निर्णयसिन्धु\) 

The *Bhavishya purāṇa* states that *daiva kāryas* and *pitṛ kāryas* should not be performed in the intercalary month, ie the month without the *Saṅkrānti* and also during *āśaucas*.

> असङ्क्रान्तं तथा मासं दैवे पित्र्ये च कर्मणि ।   
> मलमासमाशौचं च वर्जयेन्मतिमान्नरः ॥ 

As *Cāturmāsya* is an exceptional observance of *Devapūjā Karmas*, should it be observed during the above prohibited time, if it happens to come during *cāturmāsya* or not? Also, times such as *Gurvasta* and *Śukrāsta* are generally prohibited times for *śubha karmas*. So, Should *cāturmāsya* be observed at such times or not? The answer is, as *cāturmāsya* is a *‘nitya vrata’* even the above prohibitions \(of time\) are not applicable to it.

> न शैशवं न मौढ्यं च शुक्रगुर्वोर्नवा तिथेः।   
> खण्डत्वं चिन्तयेदादौ चातुर्मास्यविधौ नरः ॥ 

After the *vrata* is begun it must be continued even if one is touched by *Aśauca* in the middle. So this is an important *vrata* that must be observed without taking into consideration any prohibition mentioned for certain times.
### 4. Few objections
4. A few objections pertaining to the observance of this *vrata* and answers to them.

#### avaidikatā
\(a\) The name of this *yajna* called *cāturmāsya* appears both in *Vedas* and *smṛtis*. But it is not the famous *cāturmāsya* mentioned in the *purāṇa*s that is being currently practiced. When we study the *vedaśāstras,* we find that there are some season-related *vidhis,* which have to be observed on the full moon days of the months of *caitra, phālguṇa, Āshāḍha* and *kārtika*. They are called *‘vaiśva deva’*, *varuṇa praghāsa,* and *śākhamedha*. Other than this, there is a fourth \(*vrata*\) by name *‘śunāsīrīya’*. These are the four *cāturmāsya*s prescribed in the *Śrutis*. This alone is the *vaidika cāturmāsya* that has been prescribed by *Āpstamba, Āśwalāyana* and *yājnavalkya* and other *smṛtikāras*.

The *cāturmāsya* that is being currently observed does not belong to this class. So, can’t this *cāturmāsya* be given up as it is unvaidik and of recent origin? This is the first objection.

> पौर्णमासेनेष्ट्वा चातुर्मास्यव्रतान्युपेयात्   
> प्रतिसंवत्सरं सोमः पशुः प्रत्ययनं तथा ।   
> कर्तव्याग्रयणेष्टिश्च चातुर्मास्यानि चैव च ॥ 

This is a not a strong objection at all. It is our tradition that the mandates of *purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* are equally honourable as *śrutis* and *Smṛtis*, if they are not opposed to *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*. And, we have been proclaiming the attitude right from the beginning that, if the outcome of the observance of any precepts proves to be truly beneficial, they should be observed even though they are not mentioned in the *Śrutis, Smṛtis, Itihāsa, purāṇas, Āgamas* etc. **Here, we humbly remember the teaching o *Śrīgurudeva* who said - “If there are mandates which are *Yuktisiddhas* which \(established by means of experiments\) stated by different *ācaryās* prove to be good to one’s soul and the world, as is evident from the words “नानादेशिकवक्त्रस्थैः प्रयोगैर्युकिकल्पितैः” they should be followed, even though they do not find a mention in the *śāstras***. It should be noted here that the rules of food and *Brahmacarya* etc. precepted by the *purāṇas* regarding *cāturmāsya* have been included in the codes of *cāturmāsya* by *smṛtikārās* also. For example, one should not have his hair cut during that period, should not sleep on a cot, should not consume liquor, meat, and salt and should not have sex. One should not utter lies. “केशान्न कर्तयीत अधः शयीत मधुमांसलवणस्त्रीसङ्गमादीन् वर्जयेत् जुगुप्सेतानृतात् ।”

So the *cāturmāsya* which involves the *niyamas* that have the consent of all the *śāstrakārās,* which can bring about *Ātmasamskāra*, should necessarily be observed.

####  Kāmyavrata
b\) *Cāturmāsya* is a *Kāmyavrata*

For example, the *purāṇas* say - if one follows the rule of abstaining from consuming jaggery, his voice becomes melodious. If one gives up the use of oil \(in food\) he becomes handsome.

> मधुस्वरो भवेन्नित्यं नरो गुडविवर्जनात् ।   
> तैलस्य वर्जनादेव सुन्दराङ्गः प्रजायते । 

The second objection is that these types of *“kāmyavratas”* should not be observed by devotees of God.

This is not a strong objection. Because desires that are not opposed to *Dharma* are indeed dear to God. The *Gītacārya* proclaims “धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामो ऽस्मि भरतर्षभ” So, not all *‘Kāmyakarmas’* are prohibited for devotees. Further, by following the rules ordained for *cāturmāsya* with reference to food, the unsteadiness of the tongue gets reduced. And the restraint of senses facilitates *dhyāna* and worship. If that *vrata* is observed for the love of God, even longing for the desires vanishes. If *cāturmāsya* were to be only a *Kāmyavrata* why would *śāstras* prescribe them for *sanyāsis* also?

Some people raise an objection saying that this is specially observed in North India. And that too it is women who mainly observe it, and so is not a universal observation in India.

Even this is a very ordinary objection. If good customs are followed - be it in North India or South India, or observed by women or by men, all should follow them if they bestow *purushārthas*.

### The modalities of the *vrata*

Those who observe the *vrata* should go on fast, worship *Śrī Nārāyaṇa* and pray him “O Lord\! I am observing this *vrata* in your *Sānnidhya*. This can be completed without hurdles, only with your blessings. In case my life departs from the body in the middle of this *vrata*, let me obtain the fruits, of the *vrata* then also with your blessings.” And, reducing the worldly activities as much as possible, one should worship Lord *Nārāyaṇa* who is delightful in the posture of sleep, with meditation, stotra and worship etc. One should follow *Brahmacarya*. One should give up *Rāga* and *dvesha*. Lies should not be uttered. Robes suitable to the *vratadīksha* should be put on. One should abstain from violence to animals. Food prohibited by scriptures and causing disturbance to the *Samyama* should not be consumed. Liquor and meat should be given up during all the four months. It is good to give up some particular food items during some months. For example, One should not use vegetables in *śrāvaṇa māsa,* curds in *bhādrapadamāsa*, milk in *āśvayuja māsa* and pulses in *kārtika māsa.* \(These are respectively called the *śākavrata, dadhivrata*, *kshīravrata* and *dhānyavrata\)*.

> श्रावणे वर्जयेच्छाकं दधि भाद्रपदे तथा ।   
> दुग्धमाश्वयुजे मासि कार्तिके द्विदलं त्यजेत् ॥ 

It is good to totally give up pulses, guava fruit and brinjal.

> द्विदलं बहुबीजं च वृन्ताकं च विवर्जयेत् ।   
> नित्यान्येतानि विप्रेन्द्र व्रतान्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ 

Similarly it is good to forego ash gourd, raddish, sugarcane, jujube fruit, fresh *Āmalaka* fruit and tamarind.\)

विशेषाद् बदरीं धात्रीं कूष्माण्डं तिन्त्रिणीं त्यजेत्॥

It can’t be called a *vrata* if someone takes a vow that he is going to give up fruits and vegetables that are not liked by him, or gives up fruits and vegetables that are not available in that season. One should give up what is prohibited by the *śāstras* and the food items which cause greater unsteadiness \(fickleness\) of the tongue. One should give up with some effort, the vegetables that are available in plenty in that season.

> तत्तत्कालोद्भवाश्शाकाः वर्जनीयाः प्रयत्नतः । 

Among vegetables, the most prohibited is brinjal. That is why the saying *“purāṇa heḷalikke badanekāyi tinnalikke”* has come up.

It is best to consume only *havishyānna* in all these four months. Sins get redeemed by this and it facilities restraint and *dhyānayoga*.

“चतुर्ष्वपीह मासेषु हविष्याशी न पापभाक् \(विष्णुधर्मोत्तर\)”

At the end of the *vrata, śrotriyas* should be invited and they should be informed of the *vrata* that has been taken up. They should be fed well and offere *Dakshiṇā*. They should be gifted with cow, land, gold and clothes etc. To the extent possible, it is better to make *Godāna*, *Vastradāna*, *Śayyādāna*, *Vastradāna*, go*dāna* and *Suvarṇamūrtidāna* to couples, corresponding to the *vratas* observed by the devotee viz., eating once a day, eating only in the night, sleeping on the ground, giving up of vegetables, giving up of curds, liquor and ghee, and the observance of *brahmacaryā*.

### The benefits of observing *Cāturmāsya*:

Those who have observed the *vrata* with a *Kāmyadṛshti* giving up jaggery, oil, pungent oil, betel nut and betel leaves, ghee, fruits, vegetable dishes curds and milk, will obtain the benefits of sweet voice, beautiful body, destruction of enemies, enjoyment of material pleasures, loveliness, intelligence and progeny of many of sons, cooked food and sweet dishes food and attainment of the *goloka* respectively. If one gives up these for the love of God, he will obtain devotion to God through the restraint of senses. By observing *Brahmacarya* one will develop strength of the body, the senses, the mind, and intellect, and the accomplishment of *dhyāna yoga*. By worshipping God who is in the posture of sleep the *jnāna, bhakti* and *Vairāgyas* of the person will increase. *Gṛhasthas* obtain enjoyments which are not opposed to *yoga*, by worshipping God who in the posture of just woken up from sleep.

### *Cāturmāsya* of *sanyāsis*

*Sanyāsis* have some more distinct *Vidhis* in addition to the dos and don’ts regarding food.

		
A *sanyāsi* should undertake the observance on the full moon day of the month of *āshāḍha*. If there are difficulties, he is allowed to take the vow till the next *pañcamī*. If that *pañcamī* also passes \(without the vow\) he will be subjected to *Prāyaścitta.*

> अनेन विधिना भिक्षुः आषाढ्यां सुसमाहितः ।   
> प्रायश्चित्तेन युज्येत पाम्यूर्ध्वं व्रजेद्यदि ॥ 

He should settle down for the *vrata* after tonsure on the day of *Pūrṇimā* of *Āshāḍha*. He should not have his head tonsured in the middle till the *vrata* is completed. He should not cross rivers. Should not travel a distance beyond one *krośa*.

> आषाढ्यां पौर्णमास्यां तु वपनं कारयेद्यतिः ।   
> तेषु मासेषु केशादीनृतुसंधौ न वापयेत् ॥   
> नदीश्च न तरेत्तेषु क्रोशादूर्ध्वं न च व्रजेत् ॥ 

The ascetic should announce in front of *grhasthās* as follows. I will live in one place during these four months when Lord *Mādhava* for the welfare of all living geings is sleeping on *śeshaśayana* and wakes up again. “Generally creatures will be wandering on the paths during the rainy season. To desist from causing any violence to them, I will stay in this place if it is not inconvenient to you.”

> माधवश्चतुरो मासान् सर्वभूतहिताय वै।   
> स्वापं यास्यति शेषाङ्क,ए लक्ष्म्याः सह जगत्पतिः ॥ 

> सुप्तश्चैवोत्थितो यावन्न भवेत्तु सनातनः ।   
> अहं तावन्निवत्स्यामि सर्वभूतहिताय वै ॥   


> प्रायेण प्रावृषि प्राणिसङ्क,अलं वर्त्म दृश्यते ।   
> अतस्तेषामहिंसार्थं पक्षान्वै द्विजसंश्रयान् ॥   
> स्थास्यामश्चतुरो मासान् अत्रैवासतिबाधके ॥ 

He then holds pure *Mṛttika* in his hands and then salutes the elders, offers it to them and then receiving it as *Prasāda* uses that *Mṛttika* for his observances. Then the the disciples who are by his side request him—“You can observe the *cāturmāsya* here with happiness. We shall serve you to the extent possible with pleasure, and shall become *Kṛtārthās*”

> निवसन्तु सुखेनात्र गमिष्यामः कृतार्थताम् ।   
> यथाशकि च शुश्रूषां करिष्यामो वयं मुदा ॥ 

And then he starts the *vrata* there.

There is also a custom of worshipping *Bhagavān vedavyāsa*, the *Bhikshusūtrakāra, sanaka* and other *yogis*, *Śrī Gaṇeśa*, *Śrī Durga*, *Śrī Sarasvatī, Śrī Kshetrapālakas*, disciples of *Vyāsa* and *gurus* who are *sūtrabhāshyakāra*s.

If it is not possible to observe *cāturmāsya* for all the four months, it has to be observed at least for the first two months.

> चतुरोऽयं वसेन्मासान् वार्षिकान् द्वावथापि वा॥   
> वर्षासु ध्रुवशीलः स्यात्। 

If *cāturmāsya* is going to be observed for four months, it should be concluded on the full moon day of *Kārtika māsa*, and, if it is to be observed for two months, it should be concluded on the full moon day of *Bhādrapadamāsa*. After tonsure and bath, the remaining sacred earth should be thrown into the water, and travel should be made in the direction of north. He should then go towards north or east. After this he should return.

During these four or two months he should either observe silence, or be in meditation. Or be engaged in *japa* and *pārāyaṇa*. which facilitate silence and meditation.

Why should a *sanyāsi* observe *cāturmāsya*? The general reason is, travel is difficult during the rainy season and small creatures get troubled by his travel. The significant reason has been mentioned earlier. *Yati* is the representative of *Nārāyaṇa*. During the time when *Nārāyaṇa* is \(in the\) posture of sleep, the *Yati* also, like that God, should spend the special time in *yoga nidrā* in one place. The day of *Kārtika śuddha dvādaśī* is the day when *Nārāyaṇa* wakes up from *Yoganidrā* and receives *suprabhāta*. The custom of worshipping HIM on that day, and then with HIS permission, the *Yati* ending the vow of silence on the following full moon day and thereafter following the *āshrama dharma* for the sake of service to *Nārāyaṇa*, and starting the journey which brings about the welfare of the world, and also welfare of one’s soul, is both natural and beautiful.





	 
## Dīpāvaḷi

> उपशमितमेघनादम्   
प्रज्वलितदशाननम् रमितरामम् ।   
> रामायणमिव सुभगम्   
> दीपदिनं हरतु वो दुरितम्॥ 

Just as *Meghanāda* \(*Indrajit*\) who becomes quieted in the *Rāmāyaṇa,* the *meghanāda* becomes silent in this great festival. Like the ten faced *Rāvaṇa* who is burnt in *Rāmāyaṇa,* the tips of the wicks are lighted in this festival. As *Rāma* rejoiced in *Rāmāyaṇa*, *Śrī Rāma* and beautiful women enjoy here. This way let the day of *Dīpāvaḷi mahotsava* which is delightful like *Rāmāyaṇa,* ward off our your sins.

**\(*Bhavishyottara purāṇa* 140-71\)**

*Dīpāvaḷi* is a great festival which is most popular among the *sanātana Āryabhāratīyas*. People of all classes celebrate this with grandeur and enthusiasm in all parts of *Bhārat*. If it is celebrated with thoughtful happiness, the supreme light \(*parañjyothi*\) which is the source lamp of all knowledge, arts, and which is in the true form of the light of knowledge which is described by *jnānis* as “सत्तामात्रं निर्विशेषं निरीहं स त्वं साक्षात् विष्णुरध्यात्मदीपः” “हृदयकमलमध्ये दीपवद्वेदसारम्” \(*Guru gītā, skāndapurāṇa*\), will be pleased.

*Dīpāvaḷi* is the famous name of this festival. *Āvali* means a row, \(*vidhyālirāvalih paṅktih*\). *Dīpāvaḷi* means a row of lights \(lamps\). As this festival has a series of such \(lamps\), it’s name is *Dīpāvaḷi*. Rows of lamps are lighted in different places both inside and outside of homes and *mandirs* in the festivals of *Śivadīpotsava* and *Vishṇudīpotsava* \(*kṛttikadīpotsava*\) also, which come at the end of the month of *Kārtika*. Then, why is it that this festival \(i.e. *‘Dīpāvaḷi’*\) alone, which we have taken up \(for deliberation\), bears the special name? It is because this festival has rows of lamps lighted in a variety of ways, for many days and this festival will be a prelude for the celeberation of lighting of lamps which is special in *Kārtikadīpotsava*.

The festival of *Dīpāvali* is not limited to just one day, but is spread over four to five days, and lamps are lighted on all those days. Lamps are lighted in all the deliberations of the worships in this festival pertaining to the killing of *Narakāsura, Balīndra Vijaya, Mahālakshmī pūjā, Mahādeva pūjā, Mahārātri pūjā, Kubera pūjā, Yamadharmarāja pūjā, Go-pūjā* and *Govardhana pūjā* etc. *Dīpārati* is performed not only to God but also to human relatives and animals.

नीराजयेयुर्देवांस्तु विप्रान् गाश्च तुरङ्गमान् ।   
> ज्येष्ठान्पूज्यान् जघन्यांश्च मातृमुख्याश्च योषितः॥ 

Lamps are lighted not only in different par ts of houses, but also in *Aśramas, Maṭhas*, banks of rivers, seashores and town squares. A distinct type of sky lamp is lighted \(during night\). Not only the illumination from the lighted lamps with oil and ghee, but also the effulgence from fire crackers spread around. Gifting of lighted lamps is also done. Thus, the name *Dīpāvaḷi* suits this festival best, as this festival is full of lights in all respects. This is the reason why this festival is also called by the names *‘dīpālikā’*, *‘dīpotsava’* and *Dīpa.*

In addition to the above names, this festival is also being called by the names such as *‘sukha rātri’, ‘sukha suptikā’ ‘yaksharātri’, ‘kaumudīmahotsava’ balipāḍyamī* \(*pratipadā*\) *vīrapratipadā*, *bhaghinīdvitīyā*, *sodara bidige* etc. corresponding to the special observations of the festival. This day came to be called *Sukharātri* and *Sukhasuptikā*, for, affectionate enquiries such as “Had you a good sleep?” “Did you have a good morning” are made to greet each other by friends and relatives, who have spent the night with pleasant conversations, amusements and good sleep, after worshipping *MahāLakshmī*, the auspicious deity in the night. As *Kubera* the king of *yakshas* is worshipped and *yakshagāna* is enjoyed on that day, it is called *‘yaksharātri’*. The day was named *narakacaturdaśī* to bring to memory the killing of *naraka* by *Nārāyaṇa*. The day on which worship is offered to emperor *Bali* the *vīrabhāgavata śiromaṇi*, came to the called as *‘Balī’* and *‘Vīrapratipāda’*. The last day on which the brothers visit the homes of their sisters, and enjoy exchange of honour and regard for each other is called *‘sodara bidige’*, or *‘bhaginīdvitīyā’*. It is also called *Yamadvitīyā* to bring to memory the day on which *Yamadharmarāja* visited his sister *Yamunādevī* at her residence.

Though *dīpavali* is being celebrated by all classes of people, some call it specially as “The festival of *Vaiśyas”*. It is because *Mahālakshmī* the Goddess of wealth \(*Dhana devatā*\), and *Kubera* the presiding deity of wealth are worshipped on that day.

‘पूजनीया तथा लक्ष्मीर्विज्ञेया सुखसुप्तिका’   
“सुखरात्र्यां प्रदोषे तु कुबेरं पूजयन्ति हि” 

But it is not just a festival reminiscing one of making money only. *Mahālakshmī* is not merely the goddess of material wealth, as lay people think. All forms of auspiciousness \(prosperity\) are the forms of *Lakshmī* only. It should be remembered that she is one who is called *‘Maṅgala devatā’* being the source of all auspiciousness, and being *ashṭalakshmī rūpiṇī* \(possessing eight divine forms\) of wealth, grains etc. also happens to be *Dhanalakshmī* and *Mokshalakshmī*. Therefore it is the worship of *Lakshmī*, which is celebrated for the attainment of all the wealth of all the *Purushārthas*. The wealth of \(grains\) and money etc acquired in the parameters of *Dharma*, is desirable indeed. Merchants begin to keep a a new trade account related to their business, after *Lakshmīpūja* on that day.

The time of the celebration of the festival is the last four or five days of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* of the *āśvayuja māsa*. “आश्वयुक् कृष्णपक्षस्य चतुर्दश्यां विधूदये”. Why then this has been called a festival of the *Kārtika māsa* in some treatises? “कार्तिकेकृष्ण चतुर्दश्यामिनोदये”. Because, it will be *Kārtika māsa* according to the calculation based on the end of the month with full moon day \(*pūrṇimānta*\). But, according to *amānta māsa* calculation \(the month ending with new moon day\), it is *āśvayuja māsa* only. Though the names of the months differ, there is no change in the day of the festival.

		
Though the manner of observation of *Dīpāvaḷī* differs a little in different parts of the country, the *dīpotsava* is in vogue in all the traditions of all the provinces \(states\). Not only people belonging to *vaidik* traditions, but people belonging to *Jaina* and *Bouddha* traditions also observe the worship and *dīparādhana* at that time.

In Tamilnadu, the day of *caturdaśī* only is called *Dīpāvaḷi*. In *Karnataka* both *narakacaturdaśī* and *Balipāḍyami* are called *Dīpāvaḷi*. *Bhaginīdvitīyā* is observed in Karnataka, Andhra, Maharashtra and all over North India.

The festival of *Nīrutumbuva habba* falls on the previous night of *narakacaturdaśī* and \(in that festival\) all the vessels used for bathing are cleaned, and pure water is filled in them. Afterwards, taking oil bath very early in the morning \(*Brāhmi muhūrta*\), inviting sons-in-law and others, and having a happy conversation with them at home, children and grownups bursting crackers together, worshipping of *Balīndra* on *Balipāḍyami* on the day next to *Amāvāsya*, wearing of new clothes and ornaments, feasting, hospitality etc., are observed. These deliberations and pomp are more in Karnataka and Andhrapradesh.

The celebration of *Dīpāvaḷi* as described in *purāṇas*, *Itihāsas* and *pūjākalpas* may be summed up as follows:

*Skānda purāṇa* says that a lamp should be lighted outside the house on the night of *trayodaśī*, to ward off untimely death and to please *Yamadharmarāja*. This is called *Yamadīpa*.

> कार्तिकस्यासिते पक्षे त्रयोदश्यां निशामुखे।   
> यमदीपं बहिर्दद्यात् अपमृत्युर्विनश्यति ॥ 

May *Yamadharmarāja*, the son of *Sūrya*, who is accompanied by *Mṛtyu, pāśa, danḍa, Kālapurusha* and *shyāmādevi*, be pleased by the gift of this lighted lamp, \(done on\) this *trayodaśī*.

> मृत्युना पाशदण्डाभ्यां कालेन श्यामया सह।   
> त्रयोदश्यां दीपदानात् सूर्यजः प्रीयतां मम ॥ \(स्कान्द, पद्मपुराण\) 

All should take oil bath in the early morning of *caturdaśī* of *Kṛshṇapaksha*. Even ascetics should have this auspicious oil bath on that day. *Nārāyaṇa*, the *narakāntaka* \(slayer of the demon *naraka*\) will be pleased with this, and the fear of hell vanishes. The bath should be taken at the time of moonrise.

चतुर्दश्यां इनोदये॥

In addition to the above, one should have the have small twigs of *Uttaraṇe* \(*apamārga*\) tied around the body. This also redeems one of the sins. “हरपापमपामार्ग भ्राम्यमाणः पुनः पुनः \(भविषयोत्तर १४०-९\) There is also a precept of offering *Tarpaṇa* with gingelly seeds to *Yamadharmarāja* by uttering his fourteen sacred names.

यमाय धर्मराजाय मृत्यवे चान्तकाय च |   
वैवस्वताय कालाय सर्वभूतक्षयाय च || 

> औदुम्बराय दध्नाय नीलाय परमेष्ठिने ।   
> वृकोदराय चित्राय चित्रगुप्ताय वै नमः॥ 

Lamps should be lighted on that night in temples, *maṭhas*, shrines, *bṛndāvanas*, court yards of the homes, armoury, rivers, forts, gardens, wells and important roads, horse stables and elephant stables to avoid hell. And, in memory of *Narakāsura*, a lamp with four wicks should be lighted.

*Śāstras* state that those who take bath early in the morning using oil and water, will escape from *Yamaloka*, as *Lakshmī* and *Gaṅgā* dwell in the oil and water respectively and *aLakshmī* \(misfortunes\) also get warded off.

> तैले लक्ष्मीर्जले गङ्गा दीपावल्याश्चतुर्दशीम् ।   
> प्रातःकाले तु यः कुर्यात् यमलोकं न पश्यति ॥ \(पद्म 4-1224\)  
> अलक्ष्मीपरिहारार्थं अभ्यङ्गास्नानमाचरेत्। \(नारद संहिता\) 

We come across a good tradition of greeting those who take bath early in the morning in the above said manner with the words “had you a good bath in *Gaṅgā*?”

After this, there is a custom of crushing a bitter fruit by name *‘kārīṭa’* by trampling on it, in some provinces.

There is also a practice of consuming fourteen different vegetables.

अत्र आचारात् चतुर्दशशाकभक्षणं च कर्तव्यम् ॥

And then, path should be shown to some departed *pitṛs* on the nights of *caturdaśī* and *amāvāsyā*, by holding burning firewood in hands.

There is a custom of showing the lamps of those fire-brands and installing them at different places, uttering the following words:-

“Let the *pitṛs* in our family, either cremated or uncremated, attain *paramagati*. Let this \(fire-brand\) be the guiding light for their journey.

उज्ज्वलज्योतिषा मार्गं प्रपश्यन्तु व्रजन्तु ते॥

Then, after worshipping *MahāVishṇu, Śiva* and *Mahārātridevatās,* one should take food only in the night. Sweets should be distributed.

On the day of *amāvāsya* also one should take oil bath early in the morning and worship *Goddess Lakshmīdevī*. By this, poverty and ill luck \(misfortune\) will get warded off. The barks of *araḷi, atti*, mango, banyan and *plaksha* trees should be added to water kept for taking bath. There is a custom of having the *Ārati* by women after the bath. Along with the worship of Gods the worship of *pitṛs* also should be done either by *pārvaṇaśrāddha* or at least in the form of offering *tarpaṇa*. On that day, one should enjoy dance, vocal music and, instrumental music, and new clothes and ornaments should be put on, and happiness should be experienced. Lamps should be lighted all over the house. *Maṅgaḷārati* should be had. It is better to keep wakeful in the night. Women should frequently keep beating *Mora* and drums to prevent sleep, and should drive away misfortunes. Houses and shops should be cleaned and decorated. The night of this *amāvāsyā* is called s*ukhasuptikā*.

We see the custom of merchants and traders worshipping their books of accounts during this night and distribute sweets and *tāmbūla* to their customers and begin new accounts. As *Goddess Lakshmīdevi* keeps awake during this night, we should also keep awake and worship her. There is also a custom of worshipping *Kubera*, the Lord of wealth, along with *Lakshmī*.

The *Kārtikaśuddhaprathamā* itself is the famous *Balipāḍyamī*. It is the most significant day among all the days of *Dīpāvali*. If *svāti nakshatra* combines with it, it is considered most auspicious. One should have oil bath early in the morning on this day also. The worship of *Balīndra* is the most important *vidhi* of that night.

A picture of *Balīndra* having two arms should be drawn using five different coloured powders, or an idol of *Balīndra* should be installed. His queen *Vindhyāvalī* and the *rākshasās* in his entourage such as *Bāṇa, Kūshmānḍa* and *Mura* should figure in the picture or the idols. *Balīndra* should be decorated with a pair of ear rings, crown and other ornaments. He should be worshipped with varieties of lotuses, sandal unguents, *dīpa* and *naivedya,* by the king and all the subjects. He should be worshipped with flowers made of gold, or flowers of good colors. Among such flowers *Honnāvarike* \(*Āvaraka*\) \(a shrub with clusters of yellow flowers-cassia auriculata Lin\) is best. There is a custom of greeting *Balicakravarti* by strewing *Honnāvarike* flowers in his honour in the court yard of worship, and uttering the words *Honnu Honnu.* Some also prepare an idol of emperor *Bali* with cowdung.

The *purāṇas* say that one should pray and worship him saying “O King *Bali*, great son of *Virocana*, I prostrate before you. O Lord, you are a great soul who is going to be the *‘Indra’* in future. O King of demons, accept this worship. Bless us to obtain the *sānnidhya* of *Vishṇu*.”

> बलिराज नमस्तुभ्यं विरोचनसुत प्रभो।   
> भविष्येन्द्र सुराराते विष्णुसान्निध्यदो भव ॥   
> पूजेयं प्रतिगृह्यताम् 

And keeping wakeful at night, plays that depict stories of heroic *kshatrīyas* should be enacted. *Dānas* in the name of emperor *Bali* should be made. “Those *dānas* will become *akshaya* and please Lord *Nārāyaṇa”* say the *purāṇas*.

> बलिमुद्दिश्य दीयन्ते बलयः कुरुनन्दन।   
> यानि तान्यक्षयाण्याहुः मयैवं सम्प्रदर्शितम् ॥ \(भविष्योत्तर 140-57\) 

*Purāṇa*s also say *“Śiva* played the game of dice with *Pārvatī* on this day. So it is auspicious to play dice on this day. If one wins on this day, he will win throughout the year.”

> तस्मात् द्यूतं प्रकर्तव्यं प्रभाते तत्र मानवैः।   
> तस्मिन् द्यूते जयो यस्य तस्य संवत्सरः शुभः॥ 

*Brahma purāṇa* states that *Pārvatī* had victory on that day in the game of dice.

जितश्च शङ्करस्तत्र जयं लेभे च पार्वती॥

Cows and oxen should be given complete rest on that day. And they should be bathed, decorated, fed well with good food and worshipped. The *Govardhana* hill should be circumambulated and *GopalaKṛshṇa* should be worshipped. Those who cannot afford to go to *Govardhana* hill should worship a picture or an idol of that hill, prepared from cow dung or \(cooked\) rice.

This worship of *Govardhana* hill is called *‘anna kūta’*. *Naivedya* should be offered with grandeur to Lord *Govardhanagopāla* and mass feeding should be done.

At noon on that day, a rope made of *darbhas* should be tied around a big pillar standing in the earstern direction, and the pillar should be worshipped. This is called *‘Mārgapālī”*.

After that, people belonging to different classes should play the game of tug of war with the rope of *kuśas* tied around that tree. If the lower class of people win in that game, the king will attain victory, they say.

All the three days of *Dīpāvaḷi* viz., *caturdaśī, amāvāsyā* and *prathamā* are called *Kaumudī mahotsava*. These three days are the dark days of \(*Kṛshṇa paksha*\). *‘Kaumudī’* means moon light.

चन्द्रिका कौमुदी ज्योत्स्ना।

One may wonder how come the festival of full moon \(is celebrated\) on *amāvāsyā*? But here the meaning of *‘Kaumudī’* is, “the one which causes joy to the world.” The *purāṇas* say that this is the day which bestows a variety of joys to the people in the world.

कुशब्देन मही ज्ञेया मुदी हर्षे ततः परम्

*Balipāḍyamī* is also specially called *kaumudīmahotsava.* The reason is not just that it is the day that causes joy to everyone in the world, as said above. But, on that day special worship is performed to emperor *Bali* with *Kumuda* flowers.

> कुमुदानि बले येस्माद्दीयन्तेऽस्यां युधिष्ठिर ।   
> अर्थार्थे पार्थभूमौ च तेनैषा कौमुदी स्मृता॥ 

*Kārtikaśuddhadvitīya* is a very joyful festive day. It is also called *bhrātṛdvitīyā, Yamadvitīyā, bhaginīdvitīyā* or *sodarabidige*. On that day *Yamadharmarāja* went to the house of his sister *Yamunadevi*, received her hospitality and honoured her. Therefore, gents should not eat their meals in the afternoon in their \(own\) homes on that day. Which means, they should go to the houses of their sisters and have their happy meals served by their own hands. And they should give their sisters excellent gifts and honor them. Both the sisters and brothers should offer *arghya* to *Yama, Yamunā devī* and *Citragupta,* and worship them.

> यमं च यमुनां चैव चित्रगुप्तं च पूजयेत्।   
अर्घ्यश्चात्र प्रदातव्यो यमाय सहज द्वयैः॥ 

One should also praise *Mārkanḍeya* and other seven *ciranjīvīs*.

\(*Mārkanḍeya, Bali, Vyāsa, Hanumān, Vibhīshaṇa, Kṛpa, Paraśurāma* and *Aśvatthāma* are the eight *ciranjīvi*s\)

One should worship *Yama* and *Yamunā* and should pray “O *Sūryaputra\! Pāśahasta\! Yama, antaka\!,* and *Kāla\!* accept the worship offered by me on this *sodarabidige*. Receive the *arghya*. I offer my salutations to you, O God\! O sister of *Yamadharma*\! *Yamuna*\! *Sūryaputri*\!, *lokapūjite*\! my salutations to you. Kindly bless me with boons”.

It is very auspicious to take a bath in the river *Yamunā* and worship her on that day.

If one does not have a sister of his own, he should visit the house of a woman who is almost his sister. Then he should go to one of the houses of like paternal cousins \(i.e. daughters of uncles, aunts etc.\), daughter of a friend etc and observe the above said festival.

A question may arise whether these practices, which are either prescribed by the *śāstras* or the ones which have come down in the tradition, carry any meaning at all, or whether they are being continued just blindly. When this is taken up for an evaluation we should be free from prejudices, and should not try to somehow justify that everything in practice is right. One need not hang himself to a banyan tree with the sentimental feeling that it was planted by his father. \(This adage means is one should not blindly cling to a religious practice just because it has come down in the family for a long time\). One should also not give scope to the prejudice that everything old is wrong and everything new is correct. Accepting the conclusions arrived at, only after evaluating with an open mind, is the path of the wise. Therefore, to make it easily understood, we are presenting the matter hereby in a question-answer format.

Question 1: In some parts of our country there is a custom of crushing a bitter fruit called *Kārīṭa* by trampling on it during *Dīpāvaḷi*. What is the reason for this practice?

Answer: Though we do not find any evidence in the *śāstras* for this practice, it is indeed a meaningful one. This bitter fruit indicates the misfortune of suffering in the hell. It symbolizes the incident of Lord *Nārāyaṇa* trampling the power of *Narakāsura* and killing him. Here, the devotees also, remembering the Lord, trample on the bitter fruit that symbolizes hell.

> नमो नरकसन्त्रासरक्षामङ्गलकारिणे।   
> वासुदेवाय शान्ताय कृष्णाय परमात्मने॥ 

\(Our salutations, again and again \(*namo namah*\) to the most peaceful *paravāsudeva Śrīkṛshṇa paramātma* who provided the auspicious protection from the fear of hell\). Remembering Lord *Kṛshṇa* with gratitude, we honour this as a sacred practice which is symbolic of his divine deed. This practice is akin to the divine actions such as *Vāmana* trampling the pride of *Bali*; *ŚrīKṛshṇa* crushing the *Kāliṅga* serpent under his feet and Lord *Naṭarāja* trampling on the demon *apasmāra*.

Question 2: Why should lamps be lighted on *Dīpāvaḷi*? Is it not a waste of oil and ghee which are commodities of food, and also a waste of very precious time?

Answer: The lighting of lamps as per the modalities of the *śāstras* is helpful in the attainment of the four fold values of life. It is wrong to assume that it is a waste of materials. “What benefit is obtained by that practice? Is it *Dharma*? Is it *artha*? Is it *kāma* or Is it *moksha”* The answer is, yes. It will be useful in the attainment of all these *purushārthas*.

It is a feast to the eyes to see the rows of lamps lighted in the darkness of the night of *amāvāsyā*. When darkness vanishes, we enjoy the pleasure of light. The light also provides mundane benefits. By lighting the lamps both inside the house and in the streets outside, and also on lamp posts, as *ākāśadīpa*s, we are helped and so also the passers by. As the light of the lamps is useful to all the people of the town, it is delightful to the the eyes and is welcomed undoubtedly by the virtuous people. It is disliked only by thieves, people with eye diseases and insects like mosquitoes, bugs etc, and birds like owls. Though it \(i.e. the lamp\) is abhorred at the time of going to bed, it will be welcome after waking up from sleep. Though these rows of lights are indeed welcome on all nights, they are of special importance during the pitch darkness of the nights of *Kṛshṇapakshas.*

And the use of these lamps lighted on that day is not limited to only the mundane benefits. If the benefit is to drive away only the outer darkness it is best to light ghee lamps. That too, lighting a lamp using the cow ghee only is much better. The lighting of the lamps using gingely oil wards off afflictions. Some questions arise here. “When rows of electric lamps that can blind the eyes with dazzling lights are there, why use lamps which require oil, ghee and wicks and other fuels which produce very little light? Also, in these days when electric lamps are easily avaialbe, why use the lamps of oil and ghee, which were unavoidable in those days when electric lamps were yet to come?” But when viewed spiritually, this row of lamps, as described by *jnānis* is indeed

ज्योतिषामपि तज्ज्योतिः तमसः परमुच्यते

\(It is the light of the lights that is shining beyond the *tamas*\).

“हृदयकमलमध्ये दीपवद्वेदसारम्”

It is the *paramātma*, the essence of the *Vedas*, resembling the light in the middle of the heart lotus

अन्तर्ज्योतिः किमपि यमिनामञ्जनं योगदृष्टेः

\(It is the indescribable inner light of the *yogis* and an unguent for the vision of *yoga*\). “दीपप्रकाश शरणागति दीपिकाख्याम्” \(This is the praise of the lamp, which can cause the *śaraṇāgati* in the lord who shines like light\) So, the *tattva* to be understood here is, the row of lamps, as expounded by *jnānis*, is indeed the one which represents the *parañjyothi paramātma*, the deities who are his *amśas*, and the *vidyādīpas*. For this reason only, the lamp of God is lit first and then the other lamps are lit.

“God is a *svayamprakāśasvarūpi* \(self-effulgent form of light.\) He dispels the darkness of all the three worlds. Is it not futile to light a lamp for him?”—Some may ask. **In this regard *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* had expounded thus: “We do not light the lamp in front of God to drive his darkness away. It is a special *upacāra* we offer to God with devotion.** That is why it is uttered with the submission—“भक्त्या दीपं प्रयच्छामि”-I am offering this lighted lamp with devotion”. Not only this. The lighted lamp becomes a representative of God who is full of light also. Chanting “दीपज्योतिर्नमोऽस्तु ते” we offer a salutation with hands folded, even to the bare \(lighted\) lamp. There is a tradition of folding the hands \(in the posture of salutation\) when any lamp is lighted. But, to enhance the ability to represent God, the length of the flame in the *dīpajyoti* should be of the size of the of the thumb \(about one inch\). The shape of the flame should resemble the bud of jasmine. The flame should have the colour of topaz. It should be still and should not waver when air moves around. It should be placed in a triangular shaped niche in the wall and lighted. The smell emanating from the oil and ghee used for that should be conducive to *Ātma sādhana*. As evident from the statement “मनोनुकूले न तु चक्षुपीडने” in *yogaśāstra*, the light should be pleasant to the mind and should not cause irritation to the eyes: \(The present day trend of installing electrical blinking lights or dazzling lights in the sanctum sanctorum, or at its entrance which make our eyes close and open and vice versa causing much irritation to the eyes, is the result of ignorance \(darkness\) of the above said *Dīpatattva* in the mind indeed\!\)

Thus the lamp that is lit according to precepts, helps to meditate upon the supreme soul and cross the \(cycles of\) birth and deaths. It’s very sight wards off afflictions. It wards off untimely death. \(*Mṛtyuvināśano dīpah-Gautamadharmasūtra-kriyākānḍa*\).

If one looks at that light intently and properly, the inner centers in the body that cause untimely death get closed. The inner centers that bring good fortune open up. Above all, it helps in the realization of the *paramātmadīpa* which wards off all afflictions and sorrows.

To begin with, a lamp which is a representative of God should be lit in the *pūja* Room. Afterwards, another lamp from it should be lighted. Another one from the second one. Like this, several lamps should be lighted. The lamps of enlightenment should be lighted from the lamp of *Adhyātmavidya* and the radiance of the lamps should be made to spread both inside and outside the house.

The whole universe, as is evident from the *śloka—*

> जले विष्णुः स्थले विष्णुः विष्णुः पर्वतस्तोमके।   
> ज्वालामालाकुले विष्णुः सर्वं विष्णुमयं जगत्॥ 

is filled with the supreme soul “सत्तामात्रं निर्विशेषं निरीहं स त्वं साक्षात् विष्णुरध्यात्मदीपः”, God himself is the lamp of spirituality. *Jnānis* brought into practice this custom of lighting many lamps, to drive home the idea that the *vibhūtis* of God viz, the *devatās* and many *vidyās*, have manifested from HIM and the whole universe is filled with *vidyā*. **This reminds us of the glorious words of *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* who said “विश्वविज्ञानमन्दिरे दीपमालासहस्रं उद्दीपयाम”**

Question 3-Why is it laid down that *Ākāśadīpas* should be lit in the month of *Dīpāvaḷi*?

Answer:- This \(practice\) is also one which serves the purpose of proclaiming the glory of *Paramātmadīp*a said above. The *śāstras* say that the sky lamps should be lit on the \(top of\) pillars, to represent or symbolize God who shines in the *jnānākāśa, daharākāśa* and *Hṛdayacidambara*. “Since the lamp post which bears the lamp is the human body itself, the pillars also should be of the size of a man”, say the *śāstras*. The above said concept is made clear by the rules such as “The niche in the pillar where the lamp is lit should have eight petals. The light of the lamps should emanate through eight openings. At the centre, at the point of *Karṇikāsthāna*, the central lamp should be placed,” The eight petals of the heart lotus \(eight spokes of the *anāhata* wheel and the form of God to be meditated upon at its *Karṇikāsthāna* are well known in the *yogaśāstra*. It is indeed Lord *Nārāyaṇa*, the supreme soul and the killer of *Narakāsura* that should be specially meditated upon and worshipped with the *‘ashṭaksharmantra’* endowed with eight petals on *naraka caturdaśī* \(Each letter of this *mantra* is related to each petal\) “ध्यायन्ति ये विष्णुमनन्तमव्ययं हृत्पद्ममध्ये सततं व्यवस्थितम्”

Question 4-Is the lighted lamp dear only to supreme deities like *Vishṇu* and *Śiva*?

Answer:- The lighted lamp is dear to all the deities. Because all the *devatās* are forms of the effulgent light only. But the word *parañjyothi* applies only to the supreme God \(*Paramātma*\).

“नारायण परोज्योतिरात्मा नारायणः परः”

It may be remembered here that *Kaḷidāsa* the enlightened poet has stated “स हि देवः परञ्ज्योतिस्तमसःपरमुच्यते”, with reference to *Nārāyaṇa* and *Śambhu*.

Thus, just as the lighted lamp is dear to *devatās*, it is disliked by the *Āsurīśaktis, Bhūtās* and *pretās*. That is why people who worship the *Asurās, bhūtās* and *pretās* follow the methods like worshipping in darkness and putting off lamps etc. The moment they \(the *asurās, bhūtas* etc\) see the lamps, they run away from the place.

Question 5- What is the reason for the supposition that by walking around in the field or open space holding a torch on the day of *Dīpāvaḷi* amounts to showing *uttamagati* to the *pitṛs*?

Answer: That supposition is correct. *Yamadharmarāja* is the great *devatā* of the *pitṛs*. It is proper to worship him with lights, just as the *pitṛ devatās* who are his subjects are worshipped. \(*Pitṛs* belong to the class of deities \(*devavarga*\), so they are called *pitṛ devatās*. They do not belong to the class of *bhūtas* and *pretās* that hate lighted lamps\).

The sight of lighted lamps is also dear to those who live in the hell without attaining *sadgati*. The purport that the *darśan* of the torches shown by *jnānis* and devotees who meditate upon the meaning of the *Śrutivākya* “लोकस्य द्वारमर्चिमत् पवित्रं, ज्योतिष्मत् भ्राजमानं महस्वत्” \(This is the door for the entry into the superior worlds. It is sacred. It is shining forth with effulgent light. It is glorious.\) will be the \(guiding\) light in the path to superior worlds for \(the souls of\) the deceased, is indeed appropriate.

Question 6- Should *Ārati* be performed only to God? Or can it be done to humans and animals too?

Answer:-If one considers the *dīpa* as the representative of the effulgent light of God and performs *Nīrājana*, it becomes a service to God and it redeems the sins. For God who is beyond the torments of *Puṇya* or *pāpa* there is no need of *Pāpaparihāra* at all.

When *Nīrājana* is performed in front of humans or dear animals with the feeling that the light is the representative of God, it becomes a worship of *parañjyothi* the *Antaryāmi*. The torments of those persons and animals get removed. By the sight of the lighted lamps, the tormenting evil forces that harass them either internally or externally, get expelled. The faith that the lamp of the *Nīrājana* is a representative of God should be firm and sincere.

Question 7- Modern critics say-“In the beginning there was a mere feeling that the lamp should be lighted outside the house for warding off hell. And, when the story of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* slaying *Narakāsura* became widespread a new practice was developed by appending story with the above said opinion. Is this modern criticism correct?

Answer: Whether the criticism is modern or ancient, it can be honoured if it preaches the true meaning. Now, if one argues that the above said appended matter is merely an imagination and the story also is fictitious, why can’t it be said that this supposition by the critics also is imaginary. There is no evidence to establish which is ancient and which is recent the two, viz the sentiment involved in the lighting of lamps to escape hell and the story of the killing of *Narakāsura*. No benefit is accomplished by dextrous criticisms to determine the chronology. Whether the hell is just a supposition or a form of demon *Narakāsura*, ultimately it is indeed *Śrīkṛshṇa* the *Yogeśvara* who destroys it\! It is *SriKṛshṇa* indeed, the *Yogacārya* and God of Gods, who vanquishes *Naraka* and uplifts the forces that were held captive by him \(i.e. *Narakāsura*\) and makes them revel in their own selves\! When this *tattva* is meditated upon, the story of *Narakāsura* does not merely end up as some historical event of the distant past, but becomes an everlasting, universal truth.

Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is *pratyak Jyoti \(antarjyoti*\). *Narakāsura* was the king of the city of *Prāgjyotisha* \(dependent only on the external light\). *ŚrīKṛshṇa* along with *Satyabhāma* went there riding on *Garuḍa* the bird of *praṇava* who is indeed “वेदात्मा विहगेश्वरः” “तार्क्ष्यः श्रुतीनां निधिः”. He slayed the five headed *Narakāsura* which are the five gross elements. On the way he broke the five forts consisting of the five elements of the *naraka* city with his divine missiles. In the end he destroyed *naraka* with his divine disc *Sudarśana,* which is the divine *manastattva*. He uplifted the sixteen thousand *nāḍi* \(*nārī*\) forces that were agonized by *Naraka*, and married them. He married and will be marrying them in future also. When this *tattva* is brought to the mind and God is worshipped, then it will be realised that it is not just a conjecture of critics, but will become an experience of truth only. Any imagination that helps \(to realize\) truth is also praiseworthy. It is not impossible that such an event to have taken place also in history.

Question 8- How can the oil bath taken early in the morning of *Narakacaturdaśī* bestow a merit equivalent to a bath taken in the holy *Gaṅgā* River?

Answer:-We see a statement in the *śāstras* that during the period of eclipse, all waters become equally holy as the water of *Gaṅgā*. ***Śrī Gurudeva* had established this scientifically and had demonstrated to us that the power possessed by *Gaṅgā* in redeeming sins and providing bliss will also be in all waters, due to the \(exceptional\) circumstances present in nature during eclipses.** This is well understood by people who are knowledegeable in the science of *‘nādī’*. On all *caturdaśīs* of *Kṛshṇapaksha*, a *dharma* exists in nature which nourishes *Śivaśaktiyoga*. This \(power\) will be greater on the day of *Kṛshṇacaturdaśī* which is a *parvakāla* called *Narakacaturdaśī*.

As a result of that, a special power happens to occur in the water and oil used for the bath, and the redemptive power prevails there. If one meditates upon the *tattva* of the story of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* slaying *Narakāsura*, and if oil bath is taken with the feeling that the day is of the joyous celebration of the victory against *naraka,* the effect of *jnānagaṅgāsnāna* is certainly produced. This adoration of the victory against *Naraka* is dear to ascetics too. Therefore it is laid down that even the *yatis* should have oil bath on that day, and should obtain the benefit of taking a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā* river.

Question 9: The purpose of lighting sky-lamps during the night in the month of *Dīpāvaḷi* is only to fecilitate people at a distance to see the illumination. When this simple reason is natural, why should philosophical meanings like the light of *Jnānakāśa* etc be attributed?

Answer:- First of all, It is wrong to attribute imaginary meanings. In that case, it will be nothing but a commentary made out of one’s own imagination. We should comprehend the natural meaning of the matter. If the purpose of the sky lamps were to be just what is stated above, there would be no need for the *śāstraic* dos and don’ts in that regard. Then, what indeed are those precepts? They are as follows: The pillar of the *Ākāśadīpa* should be fixed near the house only and should have the shape of a pillar of a *yajna*. The pillar should be the one made from either the wood of flame tree, peepul, *kaggali, banni* or of other trees that are related to *yajna* only. In the place of the head of the pillar, a lamp machine in the shape of a lotus of eight petals made from four strips wood, each measuring the length of two hands, should be made. The lamps have to be placed in it in such a way that light should emanate from the openings, in eight directions. In the centre, in the *karṇikā sthāna*, the important lamp with higher luminance should be placed. Those eight lamps should be offered to *Dharma, Hara, Bhūdevi, Damodara, Dharmarāja*, *Prajāpati*, the great *pitṛ devatās* and the spirits of dead bodies that keep grieving in the darkness. The important light should be offered to *Dāmodara* with the *mantra* which carries the meaning “I am offering this lamp along with a swing to you in the month of *Kārtika*. I offer my salutations to *ananta* who is *Brahmasvarūpi”* These are the *vidhis*.

> दिवाकरेऽस्ताचलमौलिभूते गृहाद्दूरे पुरुषप्रमाणम् ।   
> यूपाकृतिं यज्ञियवृक्षदारुमारोप्य भूमावथ तस्य मूर्ध्नि ॥   
> यवाङ्गलच्छिद्रयुतास्तु मध्ये द्विहस्तदीर्घा अथ पट्टिकास्तु।   
> कृत्वा चतस्रोऽष्टदलाकृतीस्तु याभिर्भवेदष्टदिशानुसारी॥   
> तत्कर्णिकायां तु महाप्रकाशो दीपःप्रदेयो दलगास्तथाक्ष्वौ।   
> निवेद्य धर्माय हराय भूम्यै दामोदरायाप्यथ धर्मराज्ञे॥   
> प्रजापतिस्त्वथ सत्पितृभ्यः प्रेतेभ्य एवाथ तमःस्थितेभ्यः॥ 

“दामोदराय नमो ऽनन्ताय वेधसे” इति मन्त्रेण दामोदराय निवेदयेत् ॥ Says the *Āditya purāṇa*.

When we study all these meanings, it becomes clear that \(it\) is the representative of the \(*tattva*\) of *jnānākāśa* only. As the *purusha* himself is the pillar of divine knowledge \(*jnānastambha*\), the rule says that the pillar should be of the size of a man. As it is the form of a *yajna* of divine knowledge \(*jnānayajnarūpa*\), the scriptural rule states that the pillar should be made of only the trees that are prescribed for *yajnas*. The sky referred to here is *jnānākāśa*. The eight petals are the forms of the *‘anāhata cakra’* and the eight letter-petals of the great *‘ashṭāksharamahāmantra’*. The main lamp is the spiritual lamp \(*ādhyātmadīpa\)* which is representative of *Nārāyaṇa* the *Parañjyoti*, eulogized as “स त्वं साक्षात् विष्णुरध्यात्मदीपः” in *Śrīmadbhāgavata*. The other seven lights represent his retinue dieties viz. *‘Dharma’* etc.\(P. 448\) So, it naturally leads to the conclusion that the last lamp is for the *pretas* who keep suffering in darkness, anxious to go to the worlds full of light praised by the vedas as “लोकस्य द्वारमर्चिमत्पवित्रम्”, viz the path full of light. So the philosophical answer given by us to the third question is obviously very natural. There is no trace of exaggeration at all in that. But, the above *mantra-tantras* can yield the desired *tāttvik* result only when they are performed meaningfully and with \(full\) knowledge of them. Otherwise, i.e. when performed mechanically, only little benefit is obtained.

Question 10: “Gambling and hunting etc. are big vices. Those who are addicted to them are sure to suffer.—“say the *śāstras*, citing the examples of the kings *Nalamahārāja, Pānḍu, Dharmarāja* and *Parīkshidrāja”*. When such is the case, why indeed the *purāṇas* prescribe playing the game of dice on that auspicious day, though gambling is a prohibited indulgence? “तस्माद्यूतं प्रकर्तव्यं प्रभाते तत्र मानवैः” Let alone the human beings, even *Śiva* and *Pārvatī*, the parents of the universe, played the game of dice on that day and *Pārvatī* won the game”, say the *purāṇas*. Is it not ridiculous on the part of the *purāṇa*s to say so? Is it correct to attribute the vices of human beings to divinities also? \(“कार्तिके शुक्लपक्षे तु प्रथमेऽहनि सत्यवान्; जितश्च शङ्करश्चात्र जयं लेभे च पार्वती”-ब्रह्मपुराण\)”

Answer: There is nothing wrong in playing the game of dice just for fun. Neither is it sinful to enjoy the game of dice with relatives and friends, that too in a festival of joy. Only if the game crosses the limits and ends up as a gamble causing the players to lose wealth, honor and reputation, it gets dangerous. So, without exceeding the limits one may play the game of dice on that auspicious day.

“Human beings play this game for pleasure O.K. But why should the infatuation of this worldly game be attached to *Pārvatī* and *parameśvara*, the parents of the universe?”—Actually speaking they have no infatuation. They have obtained all enjoyments and revel in the supreme bliss. But if we, while playing the game, remember God and play with the feeling that the game is HIS and not ours, it will bring *śreyas* to us.

Also, the game of dice animated as the one played by the parents of the universe has a philosophical meaning. They \(i.e. the parents of the universe\) play the game dice on the chequered board of *triguṇas*. The pawns used in this game are the various *jīvas* of the world. The *karmas* of *Jīvis* comprising of sins and *puṇyas* are the dice. The parents of the universe play the game by casting the dice. They move the pawns with dexterity as per the score of the dice. Some pawns are struck out and placed again. \(i.e. they die and take birth again\) In the end all pawns should become ripe \(successful\). Some ripen quickly. Some ripen slowly \(attain salvation\). Thus a divine sentiment is hidden in this *śāstra* permitted game, which is played with a prayer to them with the words—“You are playing this divine game in your *Līlāvibhūti*. Bless us so that our pawns ripen early”

> पश्यन्तीषु श्रुतिषु परितः सूरिबृन्देन सार्धम्   
> मध्येकृत्य त्रिगुणफलकं निर्मितस्थानभेदम् ।   
> विश्वाधीशप्रणयिनि सदा विभ्रमद्यूतवृत्तौ   
> बद्धा जीवा दधति युवयोरक्षशारप्रचारम्॥ 

\(The words of *Śrī Stuti* quoted above may be remembered here which mean-*“Vedas* along with the divine scholars are witnessing the divine game of dice, played by both of you. Placing the dice board of *triguṇas* in the middle, you two are playing the game sportfully. O Mother of the universe, the *jīvas* caught in the worldly life become pawns in your sportful play of dice” The *purāṇas* say—

*“Pārvatī* won the game of dice played on *Balipāḍyamī*. So, whoever wins in the gambling in the morning of that day will be victorious through the year”. \(ततोऽहं शङ्करो दुःखी गौरी नित्यसुखोषिता । तस्मात् द्यूतं प्रकर्तव्यं प्रभाते तत्र मानवैः । तस्मिन् द्यूते जयो यस्य तस्य संवत्सरः शुभः”\). What is the purport of this? The purport is as follows: In the sportful game of protecting the devotees played by *Śiva* and *Śakti*, it is Lord *Śiva* who bestows the attainment of divine knowledge and *śakti* bestows the attainment of worldly prosperity. So if one wins in the game played in the morning on the day of *balipāḍyamī*, is an auspicious omen which indicates attainment of worldly prosperity.

As our tradition states, *purāṇas* are *Mitrasammita*. Like a friend they teach *Dharma* and *tattva*, by relating stories, parables and illustrations. We may note here that the sportful game of dice played by *Pārvatī* and *Parameśvara* preaches many *tattvas*.

Question 11: In some places there is a tradition of stealing certain things on the day of *Dīpāvali*. The custom of hiding the stolen things and cooking food from the stolen vegetables and provisions, and dining with joy etc is prevalent. Is this right?

Answer: This is a game of stealing with skill, for pleasure and amusement. It is not wrong if this game is confined to the houses of relatives and friends for mere fun. As everyone \(in this game\) has the right to steal, and if everyone exercises that right, the question of accusing anybody of stealing does not arise at all, as everyone is a “thief”. Not only this. The person who steals with skill gets, a prize also.

But care should be taken to see that this fun does not exceed the limits.

Question 12: On the day of *Balipāḍyamī* a rope is made of *kuśa* or *kāśa* \(elephant grass\) and is tied to a pillar or a tree in the eastern direction, in the afternoon. This is called *‘Mārgapālī”*. A custom is followed here. Everyone salutes this, and the king along with Brāhmins and other classes of people and elephants, horses and cows, pass below this. This rope is tied to another tree, and the king along with prominent subjects play the game of tug of war by pulling or drawing the rope. If the subjects win, it is said it indicates auspiciousness to the king. Is this custom meaningful?

Answer:- *Kuśa* is a holy grass having the presence of *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Rudra*. The custom of passing below the rope made of that grass reminds them of the sentiment that they are devotees and servants of the trinity. Therefore the *śāstras* state that only the *kuśa* grass or the *Kaśa* which belongs to same family \(if *Kuśa* is not available\) should be used. By this ritual, torments get warded off.

There is a lot of fun in the second one \(i.e. the tug of war\). The people who participate in the tug of war are the king and his subjects. The relationship between the two happens to be a most friendly one. In this game both the parties rejoice no matter who wins or loses. If we happen to lose and relatives and friends win in the game, it is a thing of special delight to us indeed.

Question 13: Some *śāstras* say that *Nārāyaṇa* killed *Narakāsura*. The story that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* killed him is also famous. We see a statement in *mahābhārata*, that after *Śrīkṛshṇa* killed *Narakāsura, Naraka* entered *Karṇa’s* self and made him work against *Nara* and *Nārāyaṇa*.

> हतस्य नरकस्यात्मा कर्णमूर्तिमुपाश्रितः।   
> तद्वैरं संस्मरन् वीर योत्स्यते केशवार्जुनौ॥ \(वनपर्व 252-20\)  

What is the purport of these statements?

		
Answer:-*Naraka* is an evil demonical force that causes sorrow to humans. \(नरान् कायतीति नरकः\). It is full of sin \(*pāpasvarūpa*\). The philosophical meaning that *Nārāyaṇa* the holiest of the holy himself destroys that force and causes joy to devotees, is true for all the times. The purport of the first statement is that sins get redeemed only from the supreme soul.

The purport of the second statement is, when that evil force incarnated in the form of *Narakāsura*, *Nārāyaṇa* incarnated in the form of *Śrīkṛshṇa*, and killed him and rescued the world. This is in the form of an historical event.

The gist of the third statement is that *Narakāsura* with the element of wickedness still remaning in him entered into *Karṇa’s* entity and nurtured enemity against *Nara-Arjuna* who was a \(friend\) of *Nārāyaṇa*. When *Arjuna* killed *Karṇa* the hellish force in him fled. And *Karṇa* attained heaven. The story of *Naraka* referred to in the *narakacaturdaśī* relates to the incident of the second statement.

Question 14: The story of *Vāmana* and *Trivikrama* is related to the festival of *Balipāḍyamī*. Emperor *Bali* was a great soul, truthful and magnanimous. Disregarding the advice of *Śukrācārya* his *guru*, he gifted a measure of three steps of earth to *Vāmana-Vishṇu*. Does not the trampling of such a great man and stealing his kingdom amount to an act of ingratitude and deception? How can this be a divine *Vyāpāra*? Should such a *Vishṇu* be worshipped on that day?

Answer:- The story of *Vāmana* and *Trivikrama* is actually a *tāttvika* story. Even if one thinks that the series of incidents of the story did happen, it is clear that, only the grace of Lord *Vishṇu* becomes evident there, and not even a trace of *adharma* is there in that. The incarnation of *Vāmana-Trivikrama* is only an incarnation of divine grace. *Bali* had usurped the kingdom of *Indra* and had committed *Adharma*. Lord *Trivikrama* cleverly took it from *Bali* and returned it to *Indra,* the rightful owner of the kingdom. This is a grace extended to *Indra* his devotee. By placing his divine foot on the head of *Bali* he \(crushed\) the demoniacal disposition in him and made him a pure soul. This was a great grace bestowed upon *Bali*. As *Bali* cherished the kingdom of *Indra*, he granted him the kingdom of the nether world which had greater luxuries and pleasures than that of the kingdom of *Indra*, and the Lord a *Bhakta Parādhīna*, as is evident from the words “बलेर्द्वरि गदापाणिः”, blessed him greatly by becoming his gate keeper. *Purāṇas* say that during *Trivikramāvātara,* Lord *Brahma* washed the foot of *Vishṇu* as it ascended to the *satyaloka*, with the holy water of his *Kamaḍalu*, and it became the divine *Gaṅgā*. *Śrī Śankarabhāgavatpāda* praises this episode of the birth of *Gaṅgā* as “आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलं पश्चात्पन्नगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम्”. Thus both *Brahmadeva* and the whole universe came to be blessed thereby. Thus, *Vāmana-trivikrama* incarnation is indeed an incarnation of a chain of blessings. The subjugation of *Bali* done cleverly though, resulted only in his *śreyas*.

When it is so, why should we unjustly accuse *Vishṇu* of injustice? The emperor *Bali* himself, thus blessed by *Vishṇu*, eulogized the divine blessings with joy, and came to be considered as one of the *parama bhāgavatas*. When it is so, why should others condemn that divine act? It is indeed auspicious to worship on that day both that God who blessed *Bali*, and the blessed emperor *Bali* the best of the *bhāgavatas*.

Question 15: Let us agree that *Vishṇu* subjugated emperor *Bali* and returned the kingdom seized from him, to *Indra*. But he could have directly fought a battle, and on vanquishing him, he could have done well to return the kingdom to *Indra* who had the right to it. Is it not great injustice to push down a donor, after begging him and receiving a gift?

Answer: The story of *Bali-Vāmana* is only a divine allegory to drive home the *tāttvika* aspects, and not a description of a historical event. Therefore the yardstick used to decide justice or injustice pertaining to a historical story does not at all suit here. Even if one were to take it as an episode that took place actually, there is no injustice in the above act of *Vāmana*.

Question 16: How can it be said that it is not injustice? Is it not wrong to push down the benefactor who was a great soul?

Answer: Only lay persons think that *Vishṇu* pushed him down. But in reality *Bali* was elevated. His demonical disposition vanished and he was lifted up. Emperor *Bali* himself has acknowledged that he has been redeemed. There is no need of a greater proof than the words of the experience of his own *Antahkaraṇa*. If it is branded injustice by people who have nothing to do with that and who have no experience in that regard, it is injustice in itself.

Question 17: Let us agree in principle that it was the elevation alone of *Bali*. But why *Vishṇu* did not follow the royal path of waging a direct war against *Bali* and take the kingdom?

Answer: Here the question of challenging for a war does not a rise at all. No one has declared a war here. *Bali* who usurped the kingdom of *Indra* is an offender and the kingdom stolen by him has to be recovered from him by awarding him the due punishment. There is no rule that the guilty must be first defeated in a war and then be punished. The king \(who holds the authority to punish\) may choose any appropriate method. Here *Bali*, who himself knew justice, has no objection for the method adopted and does not charge that he \(ie. *Vishṇu*\) should have fought a war. So, it cannot be said that the method used by *Vishṇu* was unjust.

		
Not only this. It is also possible to conclude from the results also whether the method adapted was right or wrong. In case a war had been waged, no doubt the task would have gotten accomplished, but at the cost of huge casualities on both sides. But without any \(such casualty\) all have been greatly benefitted. *Indra* has got back his rightful kingdom. The pride of *Bali* has been crushed and he has obtained *Ātmalābha*. He is made the Lord of *‘Sutalaloka’* which surpasses even *Indraloka* in opulence. “सुतलं स्वर्गिभिः प्रार्थ्यं ज्ञातिभिः परिवारितः”. He has been assured by the very Lord that he would get the position of *Indra* in future. At present, God himself has become his door keeper to see that he is not touched even a little by the demonical forces. *Sudarśana* is in the rear guard to see that his rules are not violated by the demons. So, it is certainly not correct to conclude that the acts of *Vishṇu*, which have provided him all this extrordinary happiness as wrong.

Question 18: Even then, is not the method adopted by *Vishṇu* a deceitful one?

Answer: Even if it viewed as a deception itself, it is indeed praiseworthy, like the “deception” adapted by physicians to cure a disease. Suppose a doctor promises a sweet medicine to a patient but gives instead bitter tablets coated with sugar, it is deception no doubt. But, as it proves greatly remedial to the patient, it becomes praiseworthy only.

Question 19: This answer is satisfactory. But begging is indeed a disgraceful act. A beggar is deemed lighter than even grass and cotton. Can *Vishṇu* the Lord of the universe, take to such a mean act?

Answer: No doubt it is very difficult for the Lord of the world to indulge in such a low task. But, it is only possible for the highly pious and great persons to shed selfishness, and generously wish for the welfare of the world. Those who give up selfishness in the form of fame for the sake of interests of others, are indeed preeminent even among the virtuous.

This is an answer given from the wordly point of view of morals. But in reality, it is not at all correct to measure with the yardstick of worldly justice and morals, the will and acts of the Lord, who is *Lokottara*. We have to bow our heads to the will of God.

“सुतलं स्वर्गिभिः प्रार्थ्यं ज्ञातिभिः परिवारितः”   
> “एते सत्पुरुषाः परार्थघटकाः स्वार्थान्परित्यज्य ये” 

Question 20: Which *tattvarahasya* is purported in the story of *Bali-Vāmana*?

Answer: ***Maha Yogi Śrīraṅga* who resuscitated our souls used to explain this as follows:**

Emperor *Bali* thought “I am giving refuge to thousands of *Āsurī* forces. If this *Vishṇu* asks for a little space, why should I refuse? I shall give some little space to him also,” and deciding so, he gave a promise to *Vishṇu*. He imagined the \(the measure of the\) steps of *Vishṇu* to be of some size similar to his own steps. *Vāmana Vishṇu* immediately transformed himself into a *trivikrama* and occupied the three worlds i.e.-*bhūrbhuvassuvarlokas* with his huge feet and treaded upon the head of *Bali*. Our heart itself is the place of the sacrificial altar of emperor *Bali*. “श्रद्धापत्नी शरीरमिध्ममुरो वेदिः”. The *jīva* with *Āsurī* forces which should have remained in the lower regions in the *Mūlādhāra* has occupied the heart and has made the whole body below the level of heart demonical. It has given a little space for God *Vāmana* who measures the size of a thumb, in the middle of the heart. \(“मध्ये वामनमासीनं विश्वेदेवा उपासते”\). The moment the power of God gets a little space, it goes on growing, and occupying the entire realm and making it *Vishṇumaya*, vanquishes the *Āsurī* forces and drives it to its own abode. The effulgent *Jyoti* of God happens to be the gate-keeper to the king of *Āsurī* forces in the *Mūlādhāra*. Though *Bali* is in the frame of a demon, now, by the grace of God, has lost the demonical disposition, and is thrilled with Joy at the sight of the *Jyoti*. In the past, without the sight of that *Jyoti* he was only a demon. Thus, the principle of this story is, if God is given even a little space in one’s heart, he will grow by the meditation \(of the *Sādhaka*\) and makes the whole body *brahmamaya*, and vanquishing the demonical forces, he fills the entire body with divine glories. This *tattva* can also be experienced by you.”

Question 21: After all *Bali* is a demon. He belongs to class of *Āsurī* forces. Why can’t we worship God himself on *Balipāḍyami*, instead of worshipping him?

Answer: It is proper to worship \(God\), on that day. But worshipping of emperor *Bali* also on that day pleases God very much, because, though *Bali* was born in the class of *Asuras*, he has rid himself of all the *Āsurībhāvas*, even since God stamped his graceful foot on his head, and has become a holy soul. Like *Prahlāda* he has become a *bhāgavatottama*. As God himself has declared in the words “ज्ञानीत्वात्मैव मे मतम्” and *“Tanna Bhaktara jīvanave tanna jīvanam tanna bhaktara tiliye tām bereyalla, tanna bhakta hṛdaya kamaladoḷ pratyakshanāgi Tānirutirpenu*,” those devotees who attain oneness with God and become full of divinity are indeed the very soul of God. By their worship, God himself will be extremely pleased. The worship of devotees is even greater than the worship of God himself. *Śāstras* say ‘विष्णोराराधनात्प्रोक्तं तदीयाराधनं परम्’. In the *śloka*, where *Bali* is considered as the best of great devotees and deemed a *Bhāgavatottama*,

> प्रह्लाद नारद पराशर पुण्डरीक व्यासाम्बरीष शुकशौनक भीष्म दाल्भ्यान् ।   
> रुक्माङ्गगदार्जुन वसिष्ठ विभीषणादीन् धन्यानिमान् परमभागवतान् स्मरामि॥ 

there is a version which reads *Balīndra* in place of *Vasishṭha*. The *purāṇas* also state that he is a *Paramabhāgavatottama*.

Great devotees who are in *Bhaktiyogasamādhi,* should not be discriminated as high or low, citing the reasons of caste, lineage etc. Whatever may be their lineage, *Varṇa* or *Āśrama,* they are indeed highly worshipfull. Bonds such as class \(caste\), shame \(shyness\) and fear cease to exist in them. Therefore it amounts to *Bhāgavatāpacāra* if *Bali*, the *Bhāgavatottama* is slighted just for the reason that he belongs to the class of *Asuras*. It is most appropriate to worship that great soul on the day of the festival which bears his name. The tradition of sentimentally feeling that he on that day, comes to the earth which was his kingdom in the past, and people should earn *puṇya* and *purushārthas* by offering a royal worhip to that emperor who arrive as a guest, is indeed very delightful.

Question 22: It is good to invoke him in a *Kalaśa* or on idol and worship him, which happens to be a part of the modalities of worshipping *Balicakravarti*. But in some traditions, a seven circled fort is made of cowdung and inside that, cowdug in the shape of a tower is placed and that cowdung is worshipped as *Balīndra.* Is it not wrong? imagine a lump of cowdung as the great *Balīndra*, the king of kings and a *Bhāgavatottama*?

Answer: The feeling that *Rājādhirāja Balīndra* is welcomed in a place inside the seven circled fort, is indicated here. It is indeed very appropriate. The cowdung there is not worshipped as emperor *Balīndra*. In a distinct shape of the cowdung he is invoked and worshipped.

Question 23: Why should a filthy material like cowdung be used for the construction of the fort and *Balindra’s pūjābimba*?

Answer: The fresh cowdung is a sacred subtance. Its sight, touch, smell, application and consumption in stipulated quantities are all sacred. Unlike in the droppings of other animals, germs cannot flourish in cowdung. It is a disinfectant. Being an ingredient of the *Pañcagavya* it is endowed with a great property \(power\) that can remove the sins \(blemishes\) of the skin, bones etc., which is evident from the *śloka*:

> यत्त्वगस्थिगतं पापं देहे तिष्ठति मामके ।   
> पञ्चगव्यप्राशनं तत् दहत्यग्निरिवेन्धनम् ॥ 

*Śrīdevī* is worshipped in it with the hymn *‘gandhadvāra’* So, there is nothing wrong in building the fort or preparing the image of *Balīndra* with such a sacred material.

		
Question 24: There is a custom of scattering *Honnāvarike* flowers on the streets with the uttering of the words *‘Honnu Honnu’* \(‘Gold Gold’\) to welcome *Balīndra.* why is it that only this flower is offered?

Answer: This custom is very good. As a service to that great Lord, flowers made of gold may be offered. It is the best option. If it cannot be afforded, *Honnāvarike* \(a flower of pleasant colour\) is offered as a representative of golden flowers. It is considered a great substance in *Āyurveda.* The color of that flower, like gold itself, is pleasing to the eyes and the mind, causes a cooling effect on the body and has the potential to remove both heat and sins. Not just by color, but also by property, it is invaluable like gold. It removes bile. Removes the heat of the body and acts as a coolant. Its consumption removes *Ādhivyādhis* and brings about nourishment. It provides peace and contentment. Offering of this *Honnāvarike* which is endowed with an invaluable form and a bunch of qualities to that emperor in the form of an offering of golden flowers on the streets, and praying him to walk on them and thus welcoming him, is indeed highly appealing and worthy.

Question 25: In some homes, there is practice of turning the head of the idol of *Balīndra* backwards after his worship and shouting *“Balīndra* returned to his world, *Govinda, Govinda”*. Is it not a great offence to break the neck of that idol and turn it backwards?

Answer: There is nothing wrong if the face is turned backwards with right feelings and in a refined manner. The principle of spirituality itself gets expressed by that. It is enough if the idol is just turned backwards without breaking the neck. It is a symbol of the sacred send off \(*udvāsanā*\) to the invoked deity. The sending off is performed with the sentimental feeling “शोभनार्थं पुनरागमनाय च” “Let your return journey be auspicious, May you arrive again for worship, when requested by us”

Not only this. Emperor *Bali* is a great devotee who keeps meditating upon God with his mind turned inwards. “All this time, he stayed \(here\) with his mind turned outwards \(facing east\), only to bless us. After this \(worship\) got completed, he went back to his abode again. That means he again has turned inwards. \(In the terminology of *Yogaśāstra* he turned to the west. To indicate this, the idol is placed facing backwards.\) *Brāhmīsthiti* itself is the own abode and the own world of *Balīndra*, the *Brahmajnāni.* It is supposed here that he returned to that place. It is appropriate indeed to utter the holy name of *Govinda* at that time. Here the name of *Govinda* is not uttered in the sense of death here.

> “अश्वत्थामा बलिर्व्यासः हनुमांश्च विभीषणः ।   
> कृपः परशुरामश्च सप्तैते चिरजीविनः” ॥ 

*Bali* is one among the *ciranjīvas* mentioned above. He has conquered death by the power of his divine knowledge also. How can such a great *yogi* die?

Question 26: On the following day of *Balipāḍyami*, there is a custom of visiting the sister’s place and having food there. No doubt, it is a very good practice that fosters good relationships. The joy of the getting together of the brothers and sisters atleast once a year is accomplished by this. This is O.K. But, what is the role of *Yama* and *Yamunā* in this? Why should they be worshipped on that day? It is fine that it is *‘sodara bidige’*. But how come it is *‘Yamadvitīyā*?’

Answer: *Yama* visited the home of his sister *Yamunā devī* on that day and received her hospitality. He gave her presents. In memory of this meeting of the divine brother and sister and honoring each other, the above festival is celebrated and it became *‘Yamadvitīya’* also. This has been explained earlier. The *tattvārtha* of this needs to be comprehended.

Question 27- This custom has been brought into practice to make somehow the brothers and sisters meet at least once a year. If someone is asked to visit his sister for no reason, excuses may be put forth, citing problems and difficulties. So, this is termed as a *“Dhārmika Vidhi’*, so that people will follow it with some fear, and this rule has been made. This happens to be the simple answer. Even without the concept of the meeting of *Yama* and *Yamunā*. this precept can be explained, isn’t it?.

Answer: This is not just a social custom. It is a religious precept. A religious precept has nothing to do with fear. It is an observance done with joy for warding off misfortunes and for the attainment of desires.

If *sodarabidige* were to be only a social custom, people \(*jnānis*\) would have told that brothers should visit their sister, enjoy a feast, give presents to them, and return. The sages would not have reminded the event of the meeting of *Yama* and *Yamunā*. This event is delightful and also full of *tattvārtha*. The meeting of brothers and sisters some day after a long time is a joyful occasion which carries with it a feeling of happiness. If one were to ponder who this *Yama* and *Yamunā* are, the *tattvārtha* of that becomes clear and one will be filled with spiritual happiness also.

*Yama* and *Yamunā* are the worthy son and daughter of the great God *Sūrya Nārāyaṇa*, who is a *trimūrtī svarūpa* and the one who grants good health “आरोग्यं भास्करादिच्छेत्”. They have to go to different worlds to perform their religious duties. Though *yama* who stays in the *pitṛloka* looks ferocious in his work of punishing the sinners, he is carrying out a sacred duty only. *Yamunā* resides in the *Brahmaloka* as a deity and keeps doing divine service there, and also flows as a river on earth, washing the sins of devotees, who take a bath and drink her water as per precepts. She protects them by granting long life, health, prosperity etc. This job is as tender as a flower. The job of the brother is the cruel job of torturing the *jīvas* in the hell which \(the job\) is as hard as a diamond. The job of the sister is a flower like gentle job of granting pleasures and riches. They meet once a year, with the feeling that both of them are the children of the same father, and are the extensions of the family of *Sūrya Nārāyaṇa*.

The son and daughter, who are the progeny of their parents, remember their origin on that day. They remember *Sūrya Nārāyaṇa*. Even *Devatās* remembering their origin, keep themselves engaged in their duties. Even though they are engaged in their diverse duties, they keep remembering whence they have come from and why are they engaged in these diverse duties. This is the deep *tattva* that is hidden here.

Though the job of *Yama* appears ghastly, it is also a service to God, as it is an implementation of Lord *Sūrya Nārāyaṇa’s* will and instruction. The gentle profession of *Yamunā devī* of granting pleasures and riches is also of divine origin and the implementation of the will and instruction of God. Here, just as *Yama* and *Yamunā* bring to their mind the *tattva*, that though their jobs viz. *Nigraha* and *Anugraha* are different, both are essential duties that have to performed as a command of God, and we are also reminded of this *tattva*. By following this *vidhi*, we are also made to understand an important *tattva* i.e. whether it is men or deities, they should not forget their origin in the zeal of performing of their duties, and a duty, whether harsh or tender has to be compulsorily observed, if it happens to be a command of God. By observing this on that day, two \(important\) things are accomplished. i.e. a prayer to *Yama* to bless all so that the minds do not get engaged in sinful activities which lead to hell, and a prayer to *Yamunā* to redeem the sins and grant happiness, which result from *puṇya*. The precept that brothers and sisters should honour each other, meditating upon the inspiring story of *Yama* and *Yamunā*, is indeed highly meaningful.

Question 28: Is not *Yama* a deity with a dreadful disposition and a ferocious appearance? Is he not the one who mercilessly gives indescribable tortures to the *jīvas*? Is not the worship of such an unkind and fierce natured deity based only on fear?

		
Answer:- Though *Yama* is terrible to sinners, he is indeed pleasant to *Dharmishṭhas*. He is the Lord of *Dharma* and an embodiment of justice, free from any kind of partiality and the one who dispenses justice, based on *puṇya* and *pāpa* of a person. He is an embodiment of kindness too. Because, he executes the punishment only with compassion, with the intention that the sinful *karmas* of sinners may get withered and may they get inclined towards *satkarmas* in future.

*Śrīmadbhāgavata* tells us that he is one of the *paramabhāgavatas. Kaṭhopanishat* tells us that he is a *Yogācārya* who instructed the *para tattva* to *naciketa*. For this reason, he should be considered a great deity, and worshipped with devotion.

On that day, both brothers and sisters should remember the *chirañjīvis* such as *Yama, Yamunā, Bali* and *Mārkanḍeya* \(and pray to them\) to grant long life, *Dharmabuddhi*, pleasures, riches and *Bhagavadbhakti*.

Question 29: There is a criticism that the story of the festival of this *Yama dvitīyā* is based on the conversation between *Yama* and *Yamī* appearing in the tenth *sūkta*, in the tenth *manḍala* of the *Ṛgveda*. There, even though *Yama* and *Yamī* are brother and sister, they broach the matter of marriage between them. Here is an indication that marriages were taking place between brothers and sisters among the ancient Hindu *Āryans*. Is this remark correct?

Answer: Certainly it is not correct. Because the said conversation tells us only about the incident of deliberation by the *devatās* who were discussing whether a particular observation was right or wrong. All the observations of deities are not models for human beings. “न देवचरितं चरेत्”. In addition to this, it should be noted that this *sūkta* actually condemns the marriage between a brother and a sister, in the form of a conclusion.





	 
## Gaṇeśa Caturthī

*Gaṇeśa caturthī* is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India. This is a festival that comes generally a day after *Gaurī* festival or sometimes comes on the same day of *Gaurī* festival itself. Even those who do not celebrate *Gaurī* festival, celebrate this festival without fail. *Gaṇeśa* is the most popular deity. The proverb ‘*Gaṇapanillada Grāmavilla’* \(There is no village without *Gaṇapa*\) is well known. Before elaborating upon the festival, we shall discuss about *Gaṇeśa,* the presiding deity of the festival.

Who is this god *Gaṇeśa*? To this, some may say-“What is the necessity of asking this question? Everyone knows about *Gaṇeśa*. He is the Lord of the *gaṇas* of *Śiva*. He is the beloved son of *Gaurīdevī*. He is a god who removes of all obstacles. He is the Lord who has to be worshipped first in all our religious rites. “आदावेव समस्तकर्मसु बलिं गृह्णाति भक्त्यार्पितम्” Though he is the son of *Śiva* and *Pārvatī*, he is in no way inferior to them in glory. “आदित्यमम्बिकां विष्णुं गणनाथं महेश्वरम्’ He is one among the five gods in *pañcāyatana* and is worshipped on par with *Śiva* and *Pārvatī*. Not only that. The great devotees of *Gāṇapatya* revere him as the supreme *tattva*. He is the Lord who is the cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution of the universe, is the origin of everything and is all containing. The *‘Gaṇapatyatharvaśīrsha mahopanishat’* proclaims this purport in the words “त्वमेव केवलं कर्तासि, त्वमेव केवलं धर्तासि, त्वमेव केवलं हर्तासि, त्वमेव सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्मासि, त्वं साक्षादात्मासि नित्यम्; त्वं ब्रह्मा विष्णुस्त्वं रुद्रस्त्वमिन्द्रस्त्वमग्निस्वं वायुस्त्वं सूर्यस्त्वं चन्द्रमास्त्वं ब्रह्म भूर्भुवस्सुवरोम्” His form, appearance, glory and worship have been clearly expounded in the *purāṇas, Itihāsas* and *Āgamas*. The tradition of the modalities of his worship is also well known. When such is the case, why should one ask who this *Gaṇeśa* is?” Though orthodox people and staunch devotees accept the above matters with great faith, may opinions that may shake the very foundation of such beliefs are gaining fame and publicity nowadays. Therefore, it will be appropriate to find the true meaning of the matter by examining it on the touchstone of discrimination, and then perform the *upāsana* etc. Some of the comments are as follows:

1. “*Gaṇeśa* the deity is a product of the imaginations of Indians. Dravidians and especially the farmers created the concept of *Gaṇeśa*. Seeing the herd of elephants rampaging their fields and farms, they imagined a god with the face of an elephant and started worshipping him. And he is *Gajānana*, *Gaṇapati*.” —This is one theory.

2. “He is the Lord of grains. That is why he has a large belly like a cluster of grains. Grain-devouring rats also live in such places. So the mouse was envisaged as his vehicle. The snakes swallow the mice. The snake resembles the rope used to tie the grain bunches. Therefore the image of *Gaṇeśa* having a serpent tied around his belly also developed.” This is another opinion.

3. “There is similarity between the evolution theory put forth by the scientists and the concept of ten incarnations stated in our *purāṇas*.The first of the ten incarnations is the *matsya* \(fish\) which lives only in water. Afterwards came the incarnation of *Kūrma* \(The tortoise\) which lives both in water and on land. After a long time, the human being who lives only on land happened to be created. Then it was fancied that his form could be half human and half animal. As a result of these imaginations \(the deities\) *Narasimha*, *Hayagrīva*, *Tumburu* and *Gajānana* emerged. The last among them was *Gaṇapati*. This imagination of a deity which is half man and half animal existed in Greeks also. It existed in the pre-christian era also. Perhaps this fancied deity i.e., *Gajānana* could have emerged around this time.” - We come across this theory also.

4. “The *Gaṇapati* we worship now is not basically a god of the *Aryans*. Though the word *‘Gaṇapati’* appears in the *Vedas*, it is used either in the sense of the Lord of *mantras* and *tantras*, or *Indra* the lord of the group of *devagaṇas* or an officer like a king who was the leader of the group of *gaṇas* of the Aryan race.”

“Though the Aryans defeated the native Dravidians in wars when they can came here, they could not obliterate their culture. They adopted many aspects of the natives’ culture, and lent some of their own to it and spread the blended culture thought India. At that time the *‘Gaṇapati’* a leader of groups in the *Vedas* of *Aryans* was envisioned as identical with the elephant faced god, who was being worshipped by the Dravidians. The practice of worship of *Gaṇapati* is in jains also. *Buddha* also tamed an elephant-faced female demon that was harassing people and married it in the interest of the welfare of people. That demon is none other than *Gaṇeśanī*. From this the concept of *Gaṇapati* developed in the *purāṇās*.“ - This is another theory.

5. “*Gaṇeśa* who was taken from the culture of base Dravidians became of God of Gods in India, powerful enough to be worshipped by Aryan Gods such as *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Maheśvara*. He was even worshipped widely in countries like Burma, Malasiya, Indonesia, China, Sumatra, Java, etc. He not only had the power to remove hurdles but also could cause them. Everyone started worshipping him wishing that he \(i.e. *Gaṇeśa*\) may cause no obstacles in their endeavours, even though no favour may come forth. This feeling is quite natural to human beings. For this reason only, the worship of *Gaṇeśa* spread, not just in India but also in China, Japan and other counties. Thus, *Gaṇeśa* of south India not only cast his influence over the Aryans of north India, but also on counties other than India.” — Some critics continue the theory on these lines.

Scholars have summed up the topic of *Gaṇeśa* as seen in the *Vedas*, *purāṇās, Itihāsas, smṛtis* and *sūtras* etc as under:-

In the Ṛgveda \(2-23-1\) the word *Gaṇapati* is used as an adjective of *‘brahmanaspati’*. “गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे, कविं कवीनां उपमश्रवस्तमं, ‘ज्येष्ठराजम्’ ब्रह्मणाम् ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नःशृण्वन् ऊतिभिः सीद सादनम्”

*Indra* has been addressed as *Gaṇapati* \(RV 10-112-9\). In the *yajurveda samhita* it is stated that animals come under the *Gaṇapatya* of *Rudra*. Reference from the Vedas tell us that there are many *Gaṇapatis*. \(गणपतिभ्यश्च वो नमः-शतरुद्रीय\) But nowhere in the *Vedas Gaṇeśa* is depicted as either elephant-faced, or riding a rat, or pot bellied. The *Yajurveda* states that the mouse which is said to be his vehicle, is the animal of *Rudra*. \(*Ākhuste paśuh*\). The command that *Gaṇeśa* has to be worshipped before any auspicious rites are begun, is not seen anywhere in *gṛhyasūtras* and *Dharma sūtras*. In the *bodhāyana sūtra* it is stated that *‘devatarpaṇa’* should be given to *Vināyaka, vīra, sthūla*, *varada, hastimukha, Ekadanta* and *lambodara*. But the authenticity of this part of the *sūtras* is yet to be ascertained. The *Mānava gṛhyasūtra* says that all the above names refer to *Vināyaka* and that there are four *Vināyakas* viz *‘śālakaṭankata*, *kūshmānḍarājaputra*, *vismita* and *devayajana*. But all these are wicked spirits. Under their spell, people suffer from misfortunes. Scriptures prescribe certain rites to get relieved from their spell. Another *gṛhyasūtra* says that *‘mitrasamhita’* is another name for the *Vināyakas*.

Thus, it can be understood that, earlier the *Vināyakas* were considered as evil forces that cause different obstacles and perils. Later they were considered as auspicious deities also. *Vināyaka* was appointed as the Lord of *gaṇas* by *Brahma* and *Rudra*. “He not only causes obstacles but also removes them and bestows victory.”-Says the *Yājnavalkya smṛti*.

*Yājnavalkya smṛti* also says that *Ambikā* is the mother of *Gaṇeśa*. In this *smṛti* he has been referred to as *‘mita*, *sammita*, *śālakaṭankaṭa*, and *kūshmānḍarājaputra* only, instead of *Ekadanta*, *Heramba*, *Gajānana* and *Lambodara* which are the famous names of *Gaṇeśa*. It also mentions the difficulties that occur if *Gaṇeśa* casts his spell on anyone.

		
In the *‘Bodhāyana gṛhyaśeshasūtra’*, *Vināyaka* is referred to as the Lord of demons, elephant faced, Lord of obstacles, and, the offering of *naivedya* of *Modaka* and *apūpa* to him is enjoined. This *sūtra* treatise is closer to the concepts on *Gaṇeśa* of the middle ages. The subject matter of *Gaṇeśa* appearing in the *Vanaparva* and *anuśāsana parva* of *Mahābhārata* is similar to the purport which appears in *mānava grhya sūtra*. But in the *Adiparva* of *Mahābhārata* it is stated that *Gaṇeśa* took down the epic *Mahābhārata* as told by *Vedavyāsa* like a dictation. \(Some are of the view that this part of the *Mahābhārata* is an interpolation\).

The *Gobhila smṛti* prescribes that at the beginning of all the rituals, *gaṇādhipa* should be worshipped along with the *Mātṛdevatās*. *Kāḷidāsa* does not mention the name of *Gaṇeśa*. The book *‘Harsha carita’* of *Bāṇabhaṭṭa* mentions that *Gaṇeśa* is *Vighnādhipati*, *Vidyādhipati*, and elephant faced. The *Mahāvīra carita* of the great poet *‘Bhava bhūti’* refers to the tusk of *Heramba*.

The *Vāmanapurāṇa* \(chapter 54\) tells us a strange story about the birth of *Gaṇeśa. Matsya purāṇa* instructs how *Gaṇeśa’s* idols are to be made. After stating that *Gaṇeśa* has the mouse as his carriage, it makes a mention of a great gift called *‘Mahābhutaghaṭa’*. *Bhavishya purāṇa* and *Agnipurāṇa* state that the worship of *Gaṇeśa* should be done in the month of *bhādrapada* on *caturthī*.

The oldest stone edict that refers to *Gaṇeśa* dates back to the middle of seventh century A.D.

As in Hindus, the custom of worshipping *Gaṇeśa* by Jains also is found in a religious book of Jains called *Ācāradinakara*. This book describes *Gaṇeśas* having two, four, six, nine, eighteen and even one hundred and eight arms. *Narasimha purāṇa* refers to him as having a single tusk, two tusks, or four tusks.

> एकदन्तं द्विदन्तं च चतुर्दन्तं चतुर्भुजम् ।  
> त्र्यक्षं त्रिशूलहस्तं च रक्तनेत्रं वरप्रदम् ॥ 

Modern scholars have collected references from different authentic works in a chronological order, and based on them have tried to determine the development of the concept of *Gaṇeśa*. Some of them are as follows:—

“Reference to *Gaṇeśa* does not appear in the *Vedas*. He somehow earned a place among the *devatās* between the Vedic and the *Purāṇic* periods. The interval of time between *Buddha* and the *purāṇās* may be around 1000 years. He might have joined the gods of the *Aryans* in this time interval. The tradition of *mahāyāna* of the *Bauddhas* had evolved long before the period of the *purāṇās*. We find the descriptions of *Gaṇeśa* there. \(*Gaṇeśa* in the *Bauddha* sculptures does not sport the sacred thread\)”

When Aryan*s* came towards *Brahmāvarta* they had to fight the Dravidians and other non-Aryans. Not all the non Aryans got killed in that war. As the non-Aryans were already living a highly civilized life, they incorporated the Aryan culture in theirs, and continued to live fearlessly as before. Aryans also took some deities that were being worshipped by the Non-Aryans who coexisted with them. *Nāga, Bhairava* etc are the non-*Aryan* contributions. The various spirits, devils, animals and birds; etc. came from non-Aryans. Similarly *Gaṇeśa* also is one who has come like that.

The gods and goddesses worshipped by the Aryans were well-wishers of people. The gods of non-Aryans were inferior by nature, wicked, cruel and enemies of human beings. They were being worshipped so that they may become benign. On the other hand the Aryans worshipped their deities seeking help from them. They worshipped the non-Aryan deities they had accepted, so that no trouble is caused in their endeavours. *Gaṇeśa* belongs to this category. There were no changes in *Gaṇeśa’s* previous names. He is called *vighnarāja* and *vighneshvara* only. He was punishing not just the humans, but even those people who were pious.

He used to cause trouble even for \(those who wanted to have\) the *darśana* of *Vishṇu* or *Someshvara* or *Śivaliṅga*. It is said that he would even steal the religious merits of people, which they obtained by listening to *purāṇās* and sacred stories. Therefore if he is worshipped first and gratified, his army would become peaceful, and allow people to perform meritorious deeds, \(they thought\). This is a proof to show that *Gaṇeśa* was a non-*Aryan* god. Even though Aryan*s* accepted him, he had no place in the *vaidika karmas*.

*Gaṇeśa* is not the legitimate son of Lord *Śaṅkara*. *Śaṅkara* adopted *Gaṇeśa* after his birth. There were a few vexations before *Gaṇeśa* obtained the status of the son of Lord *Śiva*. *Devatās* were scared of them. There was a fight with *Devatās* or *Śankara*. So, this shows that there was no worship of *Gaṇeśa* in the *Ārya* Dharma in the beginning. Followers of pure *vaidika dharma* opposed the propaganda given to *Gaṇeśa*. This fight was going on for a long time. Finally, the ancient *Gaṇeśa* was included in worships and got established among *Devatās*.

The spread of *Gaṇeśa \(pūja\)* started first among women. Later men continued it. “*Pārvatī* gave birth to him by her power first. Later *Śiva* accepted him as his son”—This *purānic* legend confirms the above matter.

Aryans had to encounter many diseases and calamities after their conquest march. The original inhabitants i.e. the non-Aryans, and some low level uneducated Aryans also started worshipping these gods for warding off troubles and diseases. Aryans had accepted the existence of obstructing forces such as demons, *asuras, rākshasas,* and *yātudhānas.* So, it was no problem for them to accept the new obstructing forces... He was worshipped with the feeling.—“We have given you worship \(bribe\) which you expect from us. There is no work to be done by you. So, do not create hurdles in the way of auspicious celebrations.” And, for this reason, *Vināyaka* was being worshipped a day ahead of such important programmes. And, at the end, with the words *‘vighnarāja kshamasva’* he was given a send off.

*Gaṇeśa* made a forcible entry into the group of the Aryan gods, and underwent many changes. Just as his form became refined, his nature also got refined.

Thus *Gaṇeśa* grew up as a popular deity as he became a bridge between non-Aryan and Aryan races. He came to be respected not only in India but also in Java, Sumatra and other Buddhist countries.

Some scholars refute the opinion that *Gaṇeśa* was a *Drāviḍian* deity earlier, and that he later joined the Aryan gods. According to them “It is doubtful whether Dravidians had the concept of Gaṇeśa at all. If one studies ancient literary works of the Tamil language, reference to *Gaṇeśa* is not found any where. Instead we clearly see that *‘Murugan’* was the all popular god. We see no record about the existence of a god by the name *Gaṇeśa* at all in Tamil texts.

From the point of view of sculptural evidence, the oldest idol of *Gaṇeśa* found in south India dates back to the 8th century. The oldest idol has been found in *Mathura* of North India, which belongs to either the 4th or 5th century A.D.

Because of these, a doubt arises whether a God by name *Gaṇapati* existed at all in Dravidians.

Modern scholars have made a good study of the literature, stone edicts, paintings, sculpture and other evidences pertaining to *Gaṇeśa*. Based on that, they have put forth their opinion regarding the form, appearance and glories of *Gaṇeśa*, which we have noted hereby.

On the whole, in their opinion, *Gaṇeśa* as a God was unknown to the *Vedas* which are most ancient. In course of time the concept of that god grew into the present form. And, they give the following reasons to state that he is an image which is a product of the blend of the concept of Aryan and *Drāviḍian* cultures.

1. According to *Gaṇeśa purāṇa*, *Gaṇeśa* was to be worshipped as an elephant faced god in *dvāparayuga*, “द्वापरे तु गजाननं युगभुजं रक्ताङ्गरागं विभुम्” Earlier to that, the concept that he was elephant faced never existed. This concept was not there even in the *tretāyuga*. Then came the period of conflict between Aryan*s* and Dravidians. At that time, the very contact between Aryan*s* and Dravidians was most prohibited. The relationship between Aryan*s* and Dravidians began to develop in *dvāparayuga*. Aryan*s* then consented to the inclusion of the *Drāviḍian* god *Gaṇeśa* into the group of their gods. 
2. *Gaṇeśa’s* form resembles the *Oṅkāra* of the *devanāgari* script of the Aryan*s*. It also resembles the letter ‘ā’ of Tamil the language of the Dravidians. Aryan*s* believe that *‘Om’* is the origin of creation but Dravidians believe that the letter ‘ā’ is the origin. The form of *Gaṇeśa* the original God was created as a result of the blend of these two concepts. 
3. There is a practice of making a small tower from cow dung and worshipping it at the beginning of *Vināyaka vrata*. This *Gaṇeśa* in the shape of this tower of cow dung is called as *‘piḷḷaiār’*. The word *Piḷḷai* in Tamil means both a child and Lord *Gaṇeśa*. The reason for the rule that the worship of *piḷḷaiār* should be done even before the worship of elephant faced *Gaṇapati* is that *Gaṇeśa* was earlier the god of only the Dravidians. 
4. We see that the idol of *Gaṇeśa* is made from wet clay which is a form of *prakṛti* \(nature\), and after the conclusion of the *vrata* it is given a send off by immersing it in water, which is \(also\) a form of nature. Dravidians have been doing the worship of nature right from the beginning. So *Gaṇeśa* is originally a concept of Dravidians only. 
5. There is also a tradition of worshipping round stones and hillocks as *Gaṇapati*. Even now a huge boulder in the mountain *‘Haraparvata’* near *Śrīṅagar* the capital city of Kashmir, is being worshipped as *Gaṇapati*. There is also a custom of worshipping a rock as *Gaṇeśa* in a place called *‘Gaṇeśa ghāṭi’*. This is a vestige of the *Drāviḍian* culture where *Nirākāra Gaṇapati* \(*Gaṇeśa* without attributes\) was worshipped. The concept of *Gaṇeśa—‘gajamukha’* \(elephant faced\) is of later origin. 
6. According to the *purāṇās, Gaṇeśa* is the son of *Gaurīdevi* only. Just because *Śiva* is the consort of *Gaurī*, he is considered the father of *Gaṇeśa*. *Gaurī* is the goddess of nature. That is, she is the goddess of Dravidians. Therefore basically *Gaṇeśa* happens to be a god of Dravidians as he is the son of a *Drāviḍian* goddess only. The matter that he was accepted as the son of *Śiva,* is an example of the Aryan*s* developing relationship with Dravidians and including the *Drāviḍian* god in their group of gods. 
7. The close relationship that exists between *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* is not seen between *Śiva* and *Gaṇeśa*. The festival of *Gaṇeśa* comes close to *Gaurī* festival. There is a big gap of time between the festivals of *Gaṇeśa* and *Śivarātri*. *Śivarātri* is a festival of fasting, whereas *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* festivals are festivals of feasting. *Gaṇeśa* is basically related to *Gaurī*, i.e. only to goddess of nature. This also indicates that *Gaṇeśa* was a god of Dravidians who worshipped nature. 
8. *Gaṇeśa* has the face of an elephant and the body of a human being. His face happens to be the culture of Dravidians who worshipped nature. The remaining part of the body is a symbol of the culture of Aryans who were performing *Japa* of gods having human forms. This very image proclaims that *Gaṇeśa* is a blend of Aryan and *Drāviḍian* cultures. 

“By worshipping this *Gaṇeśa*, the sentimental oneness of the Aryans and Dravidians which is nothing but the unity of the people of North and South India, can be achieved. ‘Unity in diversity’ is indeed a national necessity.”

The above opinion of modern scholars can appeal instantly to the mind and may superficially appear correct also. Continuing their argument some may say “In our country, semetic religions such as Christainity and Islam also have a big following. To represent them also, it is commendable to add a cross and a half moon-star in the hands of *Gaṇeśa*. Then he becomes a complete God *Gaṇeśa* in a reverential form. People with sentiments of national unity should worship only this type of *Gaṇeśa* idols.”

When we examine the above opinions, we do not feel inspired to worship *Gaṇeśa* in our hearts and also externally, as prescribed by our scriptures to obtain the four fold values of life viz., *Dharma, artha, kāma* and *moksha*. Doubts manifest as to whether he is the natural *ādimūla gaṇapa* or a *gaṇapa* of metamorphosis. It inspires one to daydream, in addition to eating *modakas* on the day of the *Gaṇeśa* festival. Then, does it help to remove the confusions and obtain peace of mind, if the modern theories are given up and only if the scriptures and traditions are followed, to understand the true form of *Gaṇeśa*? Is there unanimity of opinion in our *Śāstras* with respect to *ādimūla Gaṇapa*? Let us examine.

### Opinion of Śāstras on the true form of Gaṇeśa

Even in scriptures we do not find an unanimous opinion about his true form, that gives no room for any doubt. In some places he has been referred to as *Nirākāra, Oṅkārarūpi* and *Ādimūla*. In some other places he is described as the one having forms of an elephant face etc and as son of *Gaurī*, son of *Śiva*, and the elder brother of *Shaṇmukha* and so on. There is no unanimous opinion about his birth also. In this regard we come across many contradictory opinions in scriptures and traditions.

Anything for that matter, need not be considered best just because it is ancient.

“पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्” proclaims *Kaḷidāsa,* our national poet. But one should not forget that considering something superior just because it is modern, or very modern, is also a kind of blind belief. *“navīnamityeva na sādhu sarvam”* We have to decide the quality of a thing based only on its true merit.

> तदात्वे नूतनं सर्वं आयत्यां च पुरातनम् ।  
न दोषायैतदुभयं न गुणाय च कल्पते ॥ 

With this discernment, we shall try to examine the abovesaid modern and ancient opinions.

“*Gaṇeśa* is basically a non-Aryan god, a god of Dravidians, an evil demon, a cruel deity, a spirit and a *piśāca devatā,* a god rejected by the traditional Aryans and a god of the vanquished race. But the victorious Aryans, in course of time, included him among their class of gods who were being worshipped” - This is the opinion on the whole, of the modern scholars.

There is a flaw in the very root of this opinion. *Jnānis* proclaim that god is a supreme truth pertinent to all times and all places. “सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तम् ब्रह्म” “अखण्डमण्डलाकारं व्याप्तं येन चराचरम्” “एकमेवाद्वितीयं ब्रह्म” When such is the case, classifying gods as Aryan gods, Dravidian Gods, Mongolian gods etc., amounts to nothing but wantonness of ignorance. The sun and the moon are not different for Aryan*s* and Dravidians. God is also like that. The sun and moon may appear different in different arrays. But God remains as the one and only entity. Therefore, terming God *Gaṇeśa* as *Ārya, Drāviḍa* or *Āryadrāviḍa*, and crowning him as a blend of both cannot be accepted by the learned.

The opinion that God *Gaṇeśa* \(of Aryan*s* or Dravidians\) is a concept, is itself nothing but a crazy imagination. A god imagined that way will only be a theme for poetics, and and not for of *darśanaśāstra. Jnānis* who have visualized the truth declare. "I am seeing god. \(I am\) seeing him clearly. It is not an imagination. It is not a myth. It is as true as the truth. It is the truth of truths”.

*“punainduraiyen poypuhulen, sattiyam solluhinren”* “सत्यस्य सत्यमृतसत्ययोनिम्, सत्यात्मकम् त्वां शरणं प्रपद्ये”

Lord *Gaṇeśa* expounded by scriptures is a supreme truth who can be experienced thus, and is not at all a matter of poetic imagination.

We find no sound proof to state that a conflict between Aryan and *Drāviḍian* races occurred in India. It is an opinion rooted in mere imagination. Attributing Drāviḍianness to the *Gaṇeśa* who happens to be the offspring of that imagination, is just a thing of thoughtless delight.

If *Gaṇeśa* happens to be a form of a god who is *Satyasvarūpa* why do scriptures call him *‘vighnakara’*, *‘vikaṭa’* lord of ghosts and demons etc? It should be noted that he is also called the remover of obstacles *prasannavadana*, handsome, and god of gods. There are many forces which cause obstacles to all endeavours, and so they are called *vighna nāyakas* and, *Vināyakas*. “विनायकाश्च शाम्यन्ति” The Lord of such forces is *vighneśvara—ŚrīGaṇapati*. He is the Lord who weilds full control over all such evil forces which cause obstacles.. He overcomes all the hurdles of all those who obtain his grace. If he is not worshipped, the attacks of the obstacle causing forces will go on uninterruptedly. He is only a *Devataśakti* with the power to grace or punish staying in *śvarabhāva* and not at all a cruel demoniacal force. Though he is the Lord of *bhūt gaṇas*, there is no evidence to say that he is by himself a wicked *Bhūtaviśesha*. For example though *Kubera* is the Lord of the *yakshas*, he is a deity and not a *yaksha*. The *bhūtas* that belong to the *gaṇa* of *Gaṇeśa* are not *pretas* or *piśācas*. They are forces of divine origin. They have the power to help a person in *jnānamārga*. ***Śrīraṅgamahāguruhad* said - “Among them \(i.e. the *Bhūtas*\) there are some divine entities which assist God *Rudra* during destruction. They have power both to protect or devour animals at the time of the destruction of the universe and at other times.**

Such groups of *divyabhūthas* are infinite. *Kumārasvāmi*, *nandīśa* and *candīśa* etc are the Lords of some of these *gaṇas* and they also are called *Gaṇapatis*. But *MahāGaṇapati* is the lord of such *Gaṇapatis*. This title refers to *Śiva* as well. He is not cruel. Though ferocious to the wicked, he is the *Śivaśankara muddu gaṇapa* to his pious devotees. Just as *maheśvara* is *‘bhayakṛt’* and *‘bhayanāśana’*, *Gaṇeśa* is *‘Vighnakṛt’* and *‘vighnanāśana’*. He is both *prapancanāśabhīshaṇa* and *vilasilokarakshaka*. *Jnānis* describe him as both *devata* and *parādevatā*. He is indeed the protector of the world, since he causes obstacles to the endeavours of demons who are a bane to the world.

The argument put forth by some modernists that *Gaṇeśa* is a god of farmers, and He is an imagined god who would put an end to the menace of elephants is ridiculous. Why should a god who is auspicious and brings happiness to all the worlds \(*samastalokaśaṅkara*\) be associated only with farmers? To suppose that the mouse which is his vehicle as a creature with sharp teeth that devours corns and grains, is the outcome of scant knowledge. It should be noted that the mouse is described by *jnānis* as a demon and as an obstacle to *yajnas*. Again, to argue that he was conceived to get rid of the menace of elephants is also strange. Continuing on these lines, the web of imagination can be further extended by stating that God *Narasihma* was imagined to save oneself from the menace of lions, *Varāhasvami* was imagined to save oneself from the menace of pigs and to save oneself from the menace of serpents, the deity *Śeshanāga* was imagined. Can this be an honest inference?

		
Lord *Gaṇeśa* is not a flower of imagination. It is a distinct glory of god that clearly manifests to the inner eye. Statements like he is a god of *Anāryas*, a cruel god, an inferior god etc are nothing but arguments without substance. One has to know the honest opinion regarding *Gaṇeśa* only from his enlightened devotees who have visualized him. Such honest opinions have been imprinted in the *vedas*, history, *Itihāsas* and *Āgamas* etc. Truth can be experienced only by acquiring knowledge about him through the *Śāstras*, and doing *Upāsana* under the guidance of a *Guru*. This is the belief in our tradition.

But we come across stange statements, regarding *Gaṇeśa* which shake this belief and which are also contradictory in themselves, in the abovesaid books. Only prominent among them have been discussed here.

In some books it is stated that *Gaṇeśa* is the formless *Parabrahma*. In some other places he is described as *Sakāramūrti* \(a god with a form\) having the face of an elephant and holding the noose and an *ankuśa* \(a special hook\). So, a doubt arises whether great souls who have realised truth can give contradictory opinions.

But when seen with proper judgement, it can be understood that there is no actual contradiction in those statements. Even though god is basically a form of divine knowledge and bliss, a form of *parañjyoti* and truth, he gives *darśan* to his devotees in various forms, only with the auspicious *saṅkalpa* of providing a blissful refuge to the devotees.

*Jnānis* say that they are images full of *tattvas*

न ते रूपं न चाकारो नायुधानि न चास्पदम् ।  
तथापि पुरुषाकारो भक्तानां त्वम् प्रकाशसे ॥ 

1. Though water has no shape in its true form, it can take many shapes in the state of ice. Those who have seen water in both these states, do not see any difference in the form between water and ice. Both the statements viz Water has no shape or it has a shape are true when they refer to the distinct states of water. There is no actual contradiction in them. The descriptions of formless *Gaṇeśa* and *Gaṇeśa* with a form are of this type. **But a word of caution here. “Not all shapes imagined by mind at will, can be the forms of god *Gaṇeśa*. Only those forms seen and reported by *yogis* are fit for meditation and worship. *Yogis* of all periods of time and place, visualize only those distinct forms \(of god\), when their minds enter the particular centres. They cannot at all have a different experience in that regard. These are the variants of the manifestations of the supreme truth”.—This was the explanation kindly bestowed on us by the *Mahāguru* when he was expounding the *Yogasūtra*** “यथाभिमतध्यानाद्वा” 
2. *Jnānis* say that the divine auspicious form of God is *Jnānānandamaya* \(immersed in divine knowledge and bliss.\) ‘विशुद्धज्ञानदेहाय’ “ज्ञानानन्दमयं देवम्” ‘सच्चिदानन्द रूपाय’. ‘When such is the case, why the *purāṇās* say that *Pārvatī devi* created an idol from the dirt of her body, and that idol itself is *Gaṇeśa mūrti’*?. The literal sense of the figurative statements of the *purāṇās* should not be taken here. *Pārvatī* is *prakṛtimātā* \(mother nature\). The first layer of mother nature ie the *pṛhtvītattva* itself is termed here as her body’s dirt. And the *caitanya* \(spirit\) itself is *Gaṇeśamūrti* which is filled as the presiding power in that earthern mass. It may be noted here that the *Mūlādhāra* which has been stated as the abode of *Gaṇeśa* in the *Āgamas*, consists of the *pṛthvī* element. 
3. We need not blindly assume that all the available texts pertaining to *Gaṇeśa* Viz. *Itihāsa, purāṇa* and *Āgamas* are *Ārsha Sāhitya* from end to end. In them, many interpolations that have been added by people at different times can be found copiously. We have to set apart such interpolations and honour only those parts that are compatible with the philosophic principle. Even in the credible parts and evaluation, an evaluation as to which happens to be is the story part, which is figurative, which is didactic and which is the straight truth must be made. And they should be interepreted under the guidance of *jnānis*. 

For example, let us consider the story of *Gaṇeśa* getting the head of an elephant. The elephant face of that god is neither an imagination of a poet nor a symbol. All the *yogis* whose minds merge in the *‘mūlādhāra’*, get the *darśan* of an elephant’s face in a triangle. In *‘yogasūtra’*, that centre is called *‘gajakuṇḍapradeśa’*. One, whose soul departs through that place, will be born as an elephant. If, in that divine elephant faced body od deity, the power of *Śiva* happens to manifest through the *kshetra* of pure disposition \(*śuddhaprakṛti*\) it becomes Lord *‘gajānana‘*. One should not misapprehend that the elephant of the inner spiritual world is just the \(animal\) elephant we see in the external world. Though there is similarity in shape between the two, the shape of the \(elephant\) in the \(inner vision\) is a form of *‘praṇava ’* only. “प्रणवस्वरूप वक्रतुण्डम्” If the turn of the trunk is to the right, it is called *‘dakshiṇāvarta’* \(*Balamuri*\) *Gaṇapati* and it becomes *‘mokshaprada mūrti* \(the form which grants emanciation\)

When the *Upāsana* of the form of *Gaṇeśa* which has the trunk turned towards the left is done, that form bestows material enjoyment. If it enters the *tamoguṇa kshetra* \(field of darkness\) it becomes a demon with the face of an elephant \(*gajāsura*\) subdued by god *gajānana*. \(“निरस्तदैत्यकुञ्जरम्”\)

All this is the aspect of the true principle \(*tattva*\). And, *Śiva* cutting off with his trident the head of the son of *Pārvati* who stopped him when he tried to enter the inner quarters of *Pārvatī*, and subsequently \(his act of\) fixing the head of an elephant which was sleeping with its head to the north to the body of the son of *Pārvatī* etc., is the story part.

“*Gaṇeśa* was right indeed in stopping *Śiva* from entering the inner quarters of *Pārvatī* of *Gaurī* as per the command of his mother. Why should *Śiva* cut off his head?” This question is similar to the following question “*Jaya* and *Vijaya* stopped *sanaka* and other sages as *Nārāyaṇa* had ordered that no one should be allowed inside without permission. Why did the sages curse *jaya* and *vijaya* who did their duty?” Here, God has indeed bestowed enlightenment upon *Gaṇeśa*, *jaya* and *vijaya* by awarding a small punishment for the fault of drastically applying a general rule even under a special circumstances \(not knowing that *Śiva* is the supreme Lord\). The rule made by *Pārvati* does not apply to *Śiva* The rule made by *Pārvati* does not apply to *Śiva* who is the head of the family and the paramount Lord. The rule stated by *Nārāyaṇa* does not apply to supreme devotees like *sanaka* and other sages who are an example for the words “ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम्”. Even so, God does show his grace to the devotees who follow his orders. We see such a favour being shown to *Gaṇeśa, jaya* and *vijaya* in this story. Thus, this is a story that teaches both *tattva* and morals.

4. Some people deriding the devotees of *Gaṇeśa* say—“A dwarf elephant form, which is elephant faced and has a dangling huge belly, rides on a mouse and it has a snake tied around the belly, they say. Anyone who sees this ugly form feels repulsed and may feel frightened also. How uncivilized indeed are those who worship this as god.” But the devotees call Him handsome God and cute *Gaṇapa*”. Which is this beauty? And what is beauty? **When we requested Śrī Raṅgamahāguru to elucidate these, he said:—**

**“The beauty of a thing lies in its natural form. A beautiful monkey does not mean an animal having limbs like a human being and grace of movements, and dress like a human being. Only if there is monkiness in its head, body, limbs and mischievousness, it is a beautiful monkey. Similarly, when the divine forms of *Gaṇeśa, Narasimha* and *Bhadrakāḷi* etc are depicted exactly like their appearance inside, that will be their beauty. They may appear ugly and terrifying for the lay people. But, as these forms fill *sādhakas* with supreme bliss when they enter the interior which is subtle in dispositions, these natural forms \(of gods\) are called by the devotees as “handsome form” and a “mine of beauty.” As the same inner bliss flows in them when devotees see those forms in pictures, and statues etc. they call them most beautiful. When one wants to see his own form in deities, it may appear ugly and ferocious. But when one forgets his own form and becomes one with the deities, they happen to be nothing but icons of beauty and bliss.**

5. Laymen may ask- “Is it possible for that huge bellied guy to ride on a mouse”? This question occurs because they think that the mouse which is the vehicle for *Gaṇeśa*, is \(like\) the troublesome rodent with sharp teeth seen around.

But when viewed truly it will be understood that the mouse happens to be the chief of forces which causes obstacles to the worship of god and the rites and *Dharma*. They are stealthy forces within, which cause obstruction to the worship of god. Some demonical forces secretly \(snatch\) parts of *Havis* that are offered to deities in *yajnas* both internal and external. They are the *Mūshakas*. The word *‘mūshaka’* is derived from the verb root *‘mush’* \(*Musha Steye*\) which means ‘to steal’. The original form of such *mūshakas* is the *mūshaka*, the vehicle of *Vighneśvara*. Can one ride on a mouse? The above said *mūshakas* in the form of obstacles ride on us \(indeed.\). It is not possible for us to keep them in check. But the *vighneśvara-Gaṇeśa* who is the son of *Śiva* and *śakti* subdues that demon of obstacles, and rides on it. And, that demon can cause no problem to *Gaṇeśa*.

**“It is indeed God *Vighneśvara Gaṇeśa*, who, riding the obstacle demon and having total control over him, can drive him to any place of his choice or stop him anywhere at will. Even in the *purāṇās* the rat is depicted as a demon and an evil force, who tried to fight against *Gaṇeśa* but was totally defeated, surrendered to him and obtained a boon from HIM to serve him as a vehicle”—This was the valuable commentary provided by our *Mahāguru* which we humbly recall here.**

“हविर्मुषां प्रशास्तारं नौमि मूषकवाहनम्” 

5\) In *purāṇās* we come across a story of a contest between *Gaṇeśa* and his younger brother *Kumārasvāmi*. Their parents *Pārvatī* and *Parameśvara* put forth a condition that, among the two the one who circumambulates very quickly. the three worlds first, will have his marriage celebrated first. Accordingly, *Kumārasvāmi* with full enthusiasm mounted the peacock his vehicle, and set off quickly for the *Lokapradakshiṇa*. But *Gaṇeśa* started late. He was obese with a dangling belly. His carriage was a mouse. Is it possible for him to win the speed contest against *Kumārasvāmi*? But he was matchless in intelligence. On seeing *Kumārasvāmi* returning after completing the *pradakshiṇa*, *Gaṇeśa* quickly circumambulated his revered parents three times and humbly sat down in front of them. As he circumambulated his venerable parents he earned the merit which was equal to that of circumambulating the three worlds thrice. So he was adjudged the winner in the context and his marriage was performed first—This is the story.

The story is interesting. It drives home the point that parents are most venerable. There is also a message that the power of intelligence is greater than the power of the body. But at the same time we see that many people, on listening to this story, come to two harmful conclusions and offend God. They are -

1\) The intelligence level of *Kumārasvāmi* is lower than that of *Gaṇeśa*. So, the worship of *Kumārasvāmi* is inferior, and the worship of *Gaṇeśa* is superior.

a\) Both *Gaṇeśa* and *Kumārasvāmi* are the worthy sons of *Mahādeva* staying in the proximity of the God of Gods. How come even they also nurture feelings like mutual envy, attachment, hatred and one-upmanship? If that is the case, they are not true *Devatātattvas,* but just personages imagined in the human mind.

When the abovesaid conclusions invade the mind \(of devotees\) the faith in worship of god gets reduced. So, some people interpret the story as below, to induce faith in the worship of god.

“The above story is an explanatory remark intending only a praise. It’s purport is only to create devotion in the worship of *Gaṇeśa* and not in disparaging *Kumārasvāmi*. The worship of both *Gaṇeśa* and *Kumārasvāmi* is great” No doubt this interpretation is well intentioned and brilliant. It is true that such *‘arthavādas’* are used in many places in scriptures.

But the present story is related to the *yogabhūmi*. Only *yogis* who have realized truth can give an actual and a truthful account of it. **With high gratitude, we present here the explanation bestowed by *Śrīraṅgagurudeva,* the eminent master of *yoga***.

“Both *ŚrīGaṇeśa* and *ŚrīKumārasvāmi* are parts of *parañjyoti Sadā Śiva*. One may reach the *akhanḍa mūla svarūpa* by taking refuge in any of these two. But the paths to them are different. One path is making use of many \(*Siddhis*\) and reaching the goal a little late. This is the path of *kumārasvāmi*. The other path is one which is direct and fast, without the roundabout use of *Siddhis*. This is the path of *Gaṇeśa*. Both paths are superior. Those who desire to reach God after acquainting themselves with *Siddhis* follow the first path. Those who wish to reach the *paratattva* without paying attention to the *siddhis*, follow the second path. The *sādhakas* may take to any of these two paths \(according\) to their liking and desire.” Thus the abovesaid story is *tattva pradhāna.* The issue of competition or respect or disrespect between gods does not arise at all here. A universal truth which can be comprehended by *sādhakas* by own experience is expounded here.

6\) *‘Gaṇeśa’s* marriage’—is an adage in Kannada which means a marriage that continues for ever, i.e. the marriage that will never happen. According to this there is no marriage at all for *Gaṇeśa*. He is always a *Brahmacāri*. But in some places \(in scriptures\) it is stated that has a wife by name *vallabhā*. We also see statements that he has two wives, *‘Siddhiśaktidevī’* and *‘muktiśaktidevī’* or ‘* Siddhi* and *buddhi*’.

We see the idol of *ŚaktiGaṇapati* with *śaktidevī* sitting on his lap. “Why do *Śāstras* say in one place that he is unmarried and at some other places that he is married? Are these mere poetic words conjured up whimsically? This is the question which arises here. Some try to clarify thus- “Earlier he was not married. But he married later. So there is no contradiction in the above statements”. But this clarification happens to be one which has emerged from mere intellectual speculation. It carries no value in the divine field.

In reality these are different forms in the worship of ‘*Gaṇeśa*. There is a path of meditating upon *Gaṇeśa* in the *kevala*’ form. The presence of forces such as *Siddhi* will not be there. In common parlace, that form may be called *‘Avivāhita Gaṇeśa’*. When that form is worshipped, the tranquil auspicious form \(*Śivasvarūpa*\) that is behind the divine force can be experienced. But *Gaṇeśa* also has the power to grant *Siddhis* such as *aṇimā* and others. As these *siddhis* are always under his control, they may be called ‘wives’ in worldly language. If this ‘householder’ *Gaṇeśa* is worshipped, *siddhis* are obtained. It will result in worldly prosperity also.

If *brahmacāri Gaṇapati* only is worshipped, spiritual elevation is obtained. God does not have *vikāras* such as desire, anger etc., like human beings. He is *satyakāma* and *sathyasaṅkalpa*. The *śaktis* related to his *satyakāma* and *satyasaṅkalpa* are called as his wives figuritively. There are circumstances where these forces along with the supreme god give *darśana* in the *saguna Sākāra* form. And the weapons held by *Gaṇeśa* such as *pāśa*, *ankuśa*, *paraśu* \(axe\) etc happen to be his distinct forces. Thus, Lord *Gaṇeśa* grants *Siddhi* and *mukti* directly or by \(*paramparā*\) \(Successively\).

7\) Some enigmatic questions such as, whether *Gaṇeśa* is just one god or are there many *Gaṇeśas*? Does he belong to *Śivagaṇas* Or does he belong to *Vishṇu gaṇa* etc arise in our mind. If we study the scriptures we get clear solutions to these questions. *Vasus*, *rudras*, *Ādityas*, *maruts* etc. happen to be *gaṇadevatās*. Each of these *gaṇas* has a *Gaṇapati*. Among these *Gaṇapatis*, referring to only the most important *Gaṇapati* who belongs to the *Śivagaṇa* is called as *mahāGaṇapati* is well known.

As *Śivapurāṇa* puts it, there are many *Gaṇapatis* among *Śivagaṇas*. A work *‘śatarudrīya mahāsamhita’* mentions this. “गणेभ्यो गणपतिभ्यश्च वो नमः”

*Nandīśa, canḍīśa, Kumārasvāmi, Vīrabhadra* and others are also *Gaṇapatis*. *Gajānana* the most important and principal lord of all these *Gaṇapatis* is called *‘mahāGaṇapati’*. All *Gaṇapatis* are not *‘gajānanas’*.

In the *gaṇas* of *mahā Vishṇu* also, there is a *vighneśvara* by name ‘*gajānana*’. ‘गम् गजाननाय नमः” “यस्य द्विरदवक्त्राद्याः पारिषद्याः परश्शतम्” ॐ नमो गजवक्त्राद्यैः पारिषद्यैः प्रशासते । श्रीरङ्गराजसेनान्ये सूत्रवत्या समेयुषे”

*Śrīmadbhāgavatamahāpurāṇa, Śrīpāñcarātra,* and *Śrīvaikhānasāgamas* state that the name *‘vishvaksena’* applies to the *MahaGaṇapati* of the *Vishṇupārshadas* who is the Lord of this *‘gajānana ’ Gaṇapati* and many other *‘vighneśvaras*.

दुर्गां विनायकं व्यासं विष्वक्सेनम् गुरून् सुरान्\(भागवत 11, 27, 29\) 

दत्त्वोचमनमुच्छेषं विष्वक्सेनाय कल्पयेत्\(भागवत 11, 27, 43\) 

In *Śrī pāñcarātra vaikhānasāgamas* the worship of this *vishvaksena* is an inseparable part of *Vishṇu pūja*.

**Here, we humbly recall the great words of *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* who had stated that the place of *mahāGaṇapati* belonging to *mahāŚivagaṇa* is *‘mūlādhāra’* and the place of *vishvaksena mahāGaṇapati* belonging to *Vishṇu mahāgaṇa* is *‘maṇipūraka’*.**

Then, which mark has to be drawn on \(the forehead etc\) *Gaṇeśa* at the time of worship? *Tiryakpuṇḍra* or *Ūrdhvapuṇdra*? This question also gets an answer here. If the Lord that is worshipped is the *MahāGaṇapati* of *Śiva’s* troops, he should be adorned with *Tiryakpuṇḍra*. If it is *‘vishvaksena’ MahāGaṇapati*, the commander of the troops of *Vishṇu*, he should be adorned with *Ūrdhvapuṇḍra*.

8\) Some people contend that *Gaṇeśa* is not at all a *vaidik* god because there are no *Vedic* hymns in praise of *Gaṇapati*’.

Is not *Gaṇeśa* a Vedic *God*, as the *vaidika sūkta* ‘आ तू न इन्द्र क्षमन्तम्” appearing in the eighth *maṇḍala* of *Ṛgveda* is being used in *Gaṇeśa pūja*? The above *vedic* hymn clearly refers to the deity *Indra*. There is no description of *Gaṇapati* of *Śiva* or *Vishṇu* \(*gaṇas*\) there. The word *‘mahāhastī’* appearing in the *mantra* does not mean a big elephant or an elephant faced god. It means a god with a big hand and an *‘Ajānubāhu’* \(long arms extending up to the knee\) - It also means the one who has a liberal and a charitable hand. \(But the tradition of using this *sūkta* in *Gaṇeśa pūja* has come down to us from a long time\). But, just for this reason, Lord *gajānana* who is spiritually experienced by *jnānis* should not be called a non-vaidik god. *Vedas* are compositions of spiritual experiences of *jnānis*. Though a clear description of that god is not available in the vedic *samhitās,* he is indeed a *Vaidikadevatā*, as he is realized through *jnāna*. There is a clear *Dhyāna mantra* of a god who is *‘vakra tunḍa’* and *Danti* in an *upanishat* related to *‘yajnikī devatās* who figure among the gods worshipped in *navakānḍarshitarpaṇa*.

ॐ तत्पुरुषाय विद्महे वक्रतुण्डाय धीमहि ।  
> तन्नो दन्तिः प्रचोदयात् । 

This *upanishat* is esteemed by *Āpastamba*, *bodhāyana* and other *yājusha gṛhyasūtrakāra maharshis*. There is no evidence for the objection that it is a later interpolation.

A garland of *vedic* verses called *‘Gaṇeśa sūktā’* is being used in the *abhisheka* of *Gaṇeśa* and in his praise. In this garland of *vedic* verses,

आ तू न इन्द्र क्षुमन्तम् चित्रं ग्राभम् सम् गृभाय ।  
महाहस्ती दक्षिणेन ॥1॥ 

विद्या हि त्मा तुविकूर्मिं तुविदेष्णं तुवीमघम् ।

> अस्माभिः सुतं सनुहि ॥8॥ 

> सद्योजुवस्ते वाजा अस्मभ्यं विश्वश्चन्द्राः ।  
वशैश्च मक्षू जरन्ते ॥9॥ 

The *sūkta* of *Ṛgveda* \(8-81\) beginning with “आ तू न इन्द्र क्षुमन्तम्’ adorns the eight *maṇḍala*, the *mantra* “गणानां त्वा गणपतिम्” adorns the second *maṇḍala* of *ṛgveda* and also the second chapter *taittirīya samhitā* of *yajurveda*, and the two *Ṛks* viz “नि षु सीद गणपते” adorn the tenth *manḍala* of *Ṛgveda*. This garland of *mantra*s can be translated as follows:

“O lord *Indra*\! You have big hands. Hold in your right hand the money that is great, wonderful and worthy of acceptance, for my sake. We know that you are the one of multitude of actions, a bestower of plenty, the one who possesses a lot of money, vast and endowed with various protections. Come, let us praise *Indra*, the owner of wealth, and the one who is self luminous. Let not others torment us with money. Let *Indra* also praise well the name we sing, sing along with us and listen along with us. Let him accept us, facing us with money. O *Indra*, get us wealth from your right hand. Touch us well with your left hand too. Do not make us nonclaimants for money. O\! destroyer of wicked people, coming near us, get us with a firm mind the money of a person who is not charitable. O *Indra*\! You possess food which is consumed by the learned. Give it to us who are begging for that. Your food which brings delight to all, will come to us fast. People with desires praise you quickly”.

> गणानां त्वा गणपतिं हवामहे कविं कवीनाममुपमश्रवस्तमम्

\(ॠग्वेद 2-23-1 तै. सं. 2-3-14-3\) 

I invite you, who is the *Gaṇapati* of all *gaṇas*, poet among poets \(great *jnāni* among *jnānis*\). You possess food and fame which can be compared to the best, you are *jyesṭharāja* of *mantras*. You are the Lord of *Brahmas* \(i.e. of *Mantras, karmas* and food\), please come with protections and be seated.

नि षु सीद गणपते गणेषु त्वामाहुर्विप्रतमं कवीनाम् ।  
> न ॠते त्वत्क्रियते किं चनारे महामर्कं मघवन् चित्रमर्च ॥ 

> अभिख्यानो मघनवन्नाधमानान्त्सखे बोधि वसुपते सखीनाम् ।  
रणं कृधि रणकृत्सत्यशुष्माभक्ते चिदा भजा राये अस्मान् ॥  
\(ॠग्वेद - 10-112-9, 100\) 

\(“O *Gaṇapati* \! Please be seated. You are called the most enlightened among the *gaṇa*s. No rites can be performed either nearby or far away without you. O \(*Indra\!*\) the wealthy one\! Honour this venerable praise. O *Maghavan*\! Friend\! Owner of riches\! Consider us as friends who are begging you. Make us powerful and influential. O\! the one who has true \(real\) power\! Warrior\! Fight the wars. Even though we are deprived of sharing, make the part of money reach us.”\)

Some scholars raise an objection here- “In this garland of *mantras* the first and the last parts clearly refer to *Indra*. We see the words *Indra* and *maghavā* which denote *Indra* only. The middle part of the *mantras* indicates *brahmaṇaspati* \(or *bṛhaspati*\). There are no words here which are designated for *Gaṇeśa* only. Mistaking the words *Mahāhastī* and *Gaṇapati* to mean a big elephant and the Lord of *Śivagaṇas*, people are using these verses for the worship of *Gaṇeśa*. In reality *Gaṇeśa* is not a vedic god at all. How is it proper to praise him with vedic verses?” Our answer to this is as follows:. There is no objection to use the above *mantras* for the worship of *Indra* and *brahmaṇaspati*. It is clear that the purport of the *mantras* refers to them. It is also true that *Indra* and *Brahmaṇaspati* are stated as deities in the precepts which mention the ancient *Ṛshi*, *Devatā*, *chandas* and *Viniyoga*. But it is not inappropriate to use the above *mantramāla* in the worship of Lord *Gaṇeśa* who is renowned in *purāṇās* and *Āgamas*, because the purport of these *mantras* suit Lord *Gaṇeśa* as well. The word *Indra* also means the one who possesses supreme wealth and the word *‘maghavā’* means the one who is endowed with riches also. In this sense these adjectives apply to *Gaṇeśa* also. No auspicious rite is done without the worship of *Gaṇeśa* at the beginning. And, the sentence with the meaning ‘no karma either nearby or far away is done without you’ suits *Gaṇeśa* also. So these *mantras* may be used for the worship of both *Indra* and *brahmaṇaspati*, and the worship of *mahāgaṇapati*. We see that there are many *viniyogas* for the same *mantra* in many places in the rules related to *vaidika kriyā kānda*.

And one more thing has to be noted here. To know which *mantra* applies to which god, it is necessary to study the meaning of that *mantra*. And, which god is touched by the chanting of a particular *mantra* and which deity’s centre is blossomed by that, also need to be observed. When observed from the second point of view it is found that it works in the *‘mulādhāra* centre’ which is the place of *Gaṇeśa* and so, it is proper to use it for the worship of *Gaṇeśa* who is renowned in *purāṇās* and *Āgamas*.

In the “*Mahā nārāyaṇa*” which is a part of *taittirīya upanishat*, a god with a curved trunk and an ivory tusk is clearly praised. Just because clear references to *Gaṇeśa* are not found in most of the *Vedamantrās* available to us, it is audacious to consider *Gaṇeśa* himself as a non-vedic deity. A deity who has come to be experienced by *jnānis* happens to be a vedic deity only, even though he is not found in the *Vedamantrās* terminologically speaking. Because he is *veda* \(*jnāna*\) *Gocara* \(visualized by Veda i.e. *jnāna*\).

9. Some say “The features of beauty or handsomeness in people are, a tall body, slim stomach and a broad chest. Instead of conceiving the form of *Gaṇeśa* endowed with the above features, why should we comprehend him as one with a short form and a dangling stomach?

This is a childish question. God’s form will not be according to our imagination. One should meditate upon that form, which has been realized and experienced by *jnānis* and under their guidance only. Otherwise \(meditating upon some form of our liking\) amounts to meditating upon a doll of our imagnation. The forms of gods do not appear differently to different people. When a person reaches the particular centre \(field\) of that deity, the form realized by *darśana* will be distinct, and will be one and the same for all.

If one looks at the short stature and a dangling belly \(of *Gaṇeśa*\) from the physical view point of, it may look ugly. But if one honestly enters the spiritual field, the form will be attractive and blissful. This is the experience of *jnānis*.

Some mock at *Gaṇeśa*—“What has *Gaṇeśa* stuffed in his dangling belly? *Modakas*? or flesh and fat?” It is not right. Because, the form of God is *Aprākṛta*. It is full of effulgence. How can it consist of sweet meat, flesh and fat? He is the Lord in whose sovereignty the twenty one *tattvās* are hidden within. When our mind merges in that image, we will have the *darśana* of those twenty one \(*tattvas*\).

We see that the *Śāstras* state that the number twenty one is of special significance to *Gaṇeśa*. The things needed in his service viz., the leaves, flowers. *modakas* and *namaskāras* - are all twenty one in number. Why should this number be twenty one only? Is it not a mere imagination one may ask. No, it is not like that. As he is the Lord of twenty one *tattvas*, it is natural to remember that number, at every stage of his worship.

10. We come across a story related to *Śrī Gaṇeśa* and *candra*. On the day of his festival, *Gaṇeśa* was riding a mouse with a snake tied around his belly. Seeing that big bellied short elephant faced *Gaṇeśa*, *candra* began to laugh loudly. *Gaṇeśa* got enraged and pronounced a dreadfull curse- ‘If anyone happens to see you on the day of *Gaṇeśa cauti,* he shall be an object of a false accusation.” And, *Gaṇeśa* provided a relief also by saying that if the story of *Śrīkṛshṇa’s* finding of *‘Syamantakamaṇi* is listened to, the stigma of false accusation shall vanish.

Here many questions naturally arise. “How can a satellite, ie the moon can make fun of *Gaṇeśa*? Does it make any sense? What is wrong if one looks at that satellite on *Cautī*? How does it lead to a false accusation? How can one get freed from that by listening to the story of *syamantakamaṇi*? Etc.

A doubt arises here - “Has any *Harikathādāsa* \(traditional story teller\) composed this story with the intention of causing some fear in the minds of people and making them somehow to listen to the *upakhyāna* of *‘syamantakamaṇi.”*

But actually this is a story relating to *tattvas*. It is not correct to take it’s meaning literally as an incident which actually happenned in the past. It is also not right to ridicule the story without properly understanding the *tattva*.

It is a story which answers some questions viz “What will be the effect on our mind when some events happening in nature are witnessed by us? Does it help in the *Upāsana* of a deity or does it cause some adverse effect?

“न तुलस्या गणेशानं न केतक्या सदाशिवं”—As per these words of *Śivapurāṇa* one should not worship *Gaṇeśa* with *tulasi* \(holy basil\), because the sight and fragrance of *tulasi* closes the inner \(spiritual\) centers related to *Gaṇeśa*. The touch of *‘ketakī’* flower \(screw pine\) reduces the effect in the spiritual centers related to the *darśana* of *Śiva*. Likewise, seeing the \(moon\) on *cauti* impedes the worship of *Gaṇeśa*. The Sun is the reigning deity of *buddhitattva* and the moon is the reigning deity of *manastattva*.

> अन्तश्चन्द्रमसि मनसा चरन्तम्  
> चन्द्रमा मनसो जातः  
आदित्यो ग्रसते चन्द्रम् आत्मना ग्रस्यते रविः 

And *Manastattva* itself is also referred to as *candra*.

The last among the twenty one *tattvās* under the reign of *Gaṇeśa* is the mind. The twenty one true principles are the *pañcabhūtās*, *pañca karmendriyās, pañca jnānendriyās, pañcatanmātras* and the mind. When the restrained mind is merged in the inner sky of knowledge \(*jnānākāśa*\), one experiences the glory of *Gaṇeśa*. On the night of *Gaṇeśa caturthī* one should be under such a restraint, and keep blissfully experiencing the true form \(*nijasvarūpa*\) of *Gaṇeśa*. Instead of doing so, if one indulges in seeing the form of *candra* \(moon\) in the external sky, he may fail to comprehend the glory of *Gaṇeśa,* and instead, may pervertedly mock at his form. As a result, the inner spiritual centers which remove torments do not open up, and the centers which cause infamy and accusations, get opened up. The solution to this annoyance, as per the words of *Upanishads* and *tantraśāstras* viz.

“आप्नोति मनसस्पतिम्” “चेतचश्चक्रति चेतनासिः” “अर्धमात्रात्मकः कृष्णः यस्मिन् सर्वं प्रतिष्ठितम्”

is by listening with faith and devotion to the *upākhyāna* of *syamantakamaṇi* that routs out blasphemy and which happens to be the *Līla* of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* the supreme master of *Manastattva*, and by praying God. It helps in giving up the thought of seeing the moon outside, and, in making the mind which is the *candra* within, to surrender to God *Gaṇeśa*, and enjoy his glory blissfully submitted. *Jnānis* say that the purpose of the above story is to make lay persons understand this principle in a pleasing way.

11. *Gaṇeśa* has been described in some places as the son of *Śiva*, his servant, remover of obstacles and a deity who grants knowledge, wealth, progeny, fortunes, health and other wordly benefits. In some other places he is described as the supreme Lord who bestows *moksha*. Which of these two is true? This is the question that invades our mind. ***Śrīraṅgagurudeva* had stated that the answer can be clearly found in the practice of *yoga* and experiences. "In the *Upāsana* of *Gaṇeśa,* if the mind is drawn from *Mūlādhara* to *Maṇipūraka* and made to merge there, only the above said wordly *Siddhis* can be obtained by the grace of that *Śivaputra*. And, if the mind is drawn further upwards and made to merge in Sada*Śiva* of *Sahasrāra* who happens to be the 26th *tattva*, one will be benefited with supreme bliss, supreme peace and emancipation.** “सहस्रारे महापद्मे शिवेन सह मोदते”

12. “Generally \(devotees\) place a god’s idol in the *pūja* room and worship with great devotion and faith every day. They protect it from getting defiled, multilated and from such other offences that may happen. This is the natural way of the devotees. But there is a strange practice in the worship of *Gaṇeśa* on *Gaṇeśa caturthī.* After worshipping it for \(a stipulated\) period of time, they immerse it in the waters of a lake or a pond. The presence of divine forces in that idol which has been specially worshipped for a long time with devotion must be quite high indeed. Then why indeed such an idol of god is discarded in water as if it is a *Nirmālya*?” - This is a question which arises naturally.

The students of a higher secondary school who were familiar to me, performed *Gaṇeśa pūja* on *Gaṇeśa caturthī* and took the idol in a grand procession and immersed it in a lake as per tradition, and returned. Some students studying in the same school, belonging to other religious faiths, taunted them in a tone of ridicule—“O\! You are back after drowning your god in water”\! The students who had performed the send off of the deity were unable to give an appropriate reply to them, but only expressed their anger. If we also cannot get a satisfactory answer when such question confronts our mind too, it causes commotion in the minds of the staunch devotees also.

A mind which has faith in traditions and customs, searches for various answers to this problem. One person gave an answer saying that the immersing of *Gaṇeśa* in water is a symbol of washing off our sins in water. But this \(reply\) will only lead to contempt and derision. How can sins get redeemed if the idol of god is let in water? Only sins can get accrued by throwing the merit yielding idol in water, and how can it remove sins? This will be the question again.

Some others propose another solution. They say “We worship *Gaṇeśa* with extraordinary purity, customs and services on *Gaṇeśa cathurthi.* It is not possible to worship him every day with the same level of purity, customs and services. It amounts to an offence to god if he is not worshipped in that special level. So it is safe to immerse the specially worshipped idol of god in water in the above said manner.” This answer also does not stand the test of reason. Because, *Śāstras* accept the discarding of an idol of god in water, if it is broken or multilated. If a *Śivaliṅga* or a *sāligrāma* happen to get broken in the vital places, they are discarded in water, and it is also *Śāstrasammata* \(permitted by *śāstras*\). But why should an idol of *Gaṇapati*, which is free from any deformity, which is complete and beautiful, be immersed in water? If someone were to say “It is not possible to worship everyday in the prescribed manner; and so we are immersing the idol in water”, a counter question arises—“In that case, those who can afford to worship everyday as per precepts, need not immerse the *Gaṇeśa* idol in water, isn’t it?” But even such people have the custom of immersing the idol of *Gaṇeśa* in water, which is worshipped on *Gaṇeśa caturthī*. Therefore the above answer does not satisfy us. Not all idols of *Gaṇeśa* are immersed in water. The image of *Gaṇeśa* made of stone or metal which is worshiped in *‘pañcāyatana’* \(five forms of god- *Gaṇeśa, Śiva, Vishṇu, sun* and *Pārvatī*\) *pūja* everyday, is not immersed in water. Only the *Gaṇeśa* invoked in the idols of clay on *Gaṇeśa caturthī* is immersed in water.

“There is a custom of performing the *udvasanā* of *Gaṇeśa* mentally who is worshipped every day with invocation and sixteen types *upacāras*. So, why not perform the *udvāsanā* of *Gaṇeśa* in this way who is worshipped on *Gaṇeśa caturthī*? Why immerse in water only? If one is not able to worship, can he not give it to other devotees who wish to worship it? Or, if such persons do not come by, the idol may be kept in a place where it won’t be treaded upon. It may be buried in a pit. What is the purpose of immersing in water only”? Such questions also arise.

The answer to the above questions should not be searched in the intellectual realm and not in the imaginary world also. Because, *Gaṇeśa* is beyond intellectual thoughts and imaginations, and is a *satyamūrtī* who can be realized by experience in the hearts *jnānis*. Right answers for the doubts pertaining to him can be found only in the *‘yogabhūmi’*. **Here we shall place forth the answers for the above doubt, which were graced by *Śrīraṅgagurudeva* the eminent *Yogi***.

“There are many categories in the divine forms of *Gaṇeśa*. The form of *Gaṇeśa* known as *‘Siddhi Vināyaka’* should be worshipped with a special *saṅkalpa* on that day to obtain relief from the *tāpa-trayas*. At that time, great *yogis* worship *Gaṇeśa* at *Mūlādhāra* and merge their mind in *Gaṇeśa* at *Maṇipūraka* which is above that \(*Mūladhara*\). To obtain relief from the above said *Tāpa-trayās*, the merging of the mind in *Maṇipūraka* is sufficient. *Mūlādhara* is the place of *‘pṛthivi*” *tattva*. *Yogis* merge *pṛthivī tattva* in *jalatattva* in their inner world in the abovesaid manner. The great sages who are also *Mahāyogis* have taught a *tantra* to provide the experience of the inner world to those who are not *yogis*, and to give an education which is in accordance with the experience of the inner world. That is, to immerse the *Gaṇeśa* made of clay which is the external form of *pṛthivī* \(*tattva*\) in the pure water of a lake, which is the external form of *‘jalatattva’*, as per scriptural precepts.

“If one immerses the clay *Gaṇeśa* in water with the wish “Let *pṛthivī tattva* get merged in *jalatattva* inside me”, then the mind travels inwards in the spiritual centers of *laya* of the inner world, and helps for the easy fulfillment of our desires and wealth.”

> पृथिवीतो जले लीनं विभाव्यान्तर्महर्षिभिः ।  
यस्यार्प्यते जलाधारे बहिः पार्थिव विग्रहः ॥ 

“The idol of *Gaṇeśa* to be worshipped on that day should have the trunk bent to the left. Those who desire only *‘brahmajnāna’* should worship an idol of *‘Balamuri’ Gaṇeśa*. Then the mind moves crossing the *‘cakrasthāna’* \(places of mystical wheels\) that are above *maṇipūraka*, and travels upwards upto *sahasrāra* and then merges in *sahasrāra*. So, the immersion of the clay idol of *Gaṇeśa* which is worshipped on *Gaṇeśa caturthī* in a lake, is a great external *yajna* which fosters the internal *yajna*”.—**We gratefully remember *Śrīgurumūrti* who drove home the *tattvārtha* pertaining to the *Yogabhūmi* in this way, which is both authentic and beautiful.**

4. *Āgamās* tell us that there are twenty-one or thirty-two types of the *mūrtis* \(forms\) of *Gaṇeśa. Mudgala purāṇa* enumerates thirty two types. They are, *bāla Gaṇapati, taruṇa Gaṇapati, bhakta Gaṇapati, vīra Gaṇapati, śakti Gaṇapati, dvija Gaṇapati, siddha Gaṇapati, ucchishṭa Gaṇapati, vighna Gaṇapati, kshipra Gaṇapati, heramba Gaṇapati, Lakshmī Gaṇapati, mahā Gaṇapati, vijaya Gaṇapati, nṛtya Gaṇapati, Ūrdhva Gaṇapati, Ekākshara Gaṇapati, vara Gaṇapati, tryakshara Gaṇapati, kshipraprasāda Gaṇapati, haridrā Gaṇapati, Ekadanta Gaṇapati, sṛshṭi Gaṇapati, uddanḍa Gaṇapati, Ṛṇamocaka Gaṇapati, hunḍhi Gaṇapati, dvimukha Gaṇapati, trimukha Gaṇapati, simha Gaṇapati, yoga Gaṇapati, durgā Gaṇapati* and *sankashṭahara Gaṇapati*.

> सिंहो योगश्च दुर्गा च देवस्सङ्कटहारकः ॥

Among these idols *ucchishṭaGaṇapati* has been a target of special criticism. “He has a blue lotus, a pomegranate, a *vīna*, an ear of paddy, a *gulagaṅji* \(abrus prectorius\), and a rosary in his hands. He is dark complexioned.” This is the description of *Ucchishṭa Gaṇapati*.

		
> नीलाब्जदाडिमीवीणाशालिगुञ्जाक्षसूत्रकम् ।  
दधदुच्छिष्टनामा यः गणेशः पातु मेचकः ॥ 

According to another description he has placed his trunk in the *yoni* of *devi* and is infatuated with love \(passion\).

“योनीविनिहितकरम्” “नारीयोनीरसास्वादलोलुपं काममोहितम्”

The second description has caused a feeling of disgust in many people, and it is quite natural. “This *Gaṇeśa* is the imagination of only lustful people who have done so just to satiate their bad taste. This is the meanest among imaginations”—This is the wrath expressed by many. By worshipping this form of *Gaṇeśa* how can the mind get pure?”—Questions like these occur naturally. We shall give hereby, answers to some of those questions.

The answers should be taken here with discrimination which is free from preconceived notions. The male and female genital organs are created in the body for a specific purpose, just like the hands, feet, eyes, etc.They are not vile by themselves. They become vile only when they are used in a sinful way which is opposed to *Dharma*. If they are used as per precepts for righteous progeny and for *Kāma* not opposed to *Dharma*, they won’t be sinful or vile. Scriptures state that the *Gaṇeśa* described above should be worshipped by those who desire the *purushārtha* viz *kāma* which is not opposed to *Dharma,* with a pure mind. There is no rule that all should worship this *ucchishṭaGaṇapati*. But others need not look at such worshippers or that idol with contempt. One should not forget that there is also a form of *Gaṇeśa* viz. *‘yoga Gaṇapati’* who, in the *Yogārūḍha* posture, becomes *yogapaṭṭābhirāma* and shines like the morning sun, wears a sapphire coloured cloth, holds the *pāśa,* a sugarcane staff, a rosary and a *yogadanḍa*, and wards off obstacles to *yoga*.

> योगारूढो योगपट्टाभिरामः  
बालार्काभश्चेन्द्रनीलांशुकाढ्यः ।  
पाशेक्ष्वक्षान् योगदण्डम् दधानो  
पायान्नित्यं योगविघ्नेश्वरो नः॥ 

It is Lord *SiddhiVināyaka* who is worshipped on *Gaṇeśacaturthī* and not *ucchishṭa Gaṇapati*. Even then, incidentally we shall discuss about *ucchishṭā gaṇapti* who figures in the *Gaṇeśadevatākalpa*, as his form has caused disturbance in minds of a lot of people, and with the intention that the peace of mind required for the worship of *Gaṇeśa* shall not get affected.

1\) Why is the name *‘ucchishṭā Gaṇapati’* given to the above form of *Gaṇeśa?*

*Ucchishṭā* generally means defiled food \(*enjalu* in Kannada\). Is it proper to associate an adjective that denotes an impure thing with god who is very pure?

Answer to this question is as follows:- Though the *samskṛta* word *ucchishṭa* means defiled food in common usage, it does not connote the same sense in all the contexts. The literal meaning of the word is, “Remaining at the top”. The usage has come into vogue because some left over food remains after lunch. This is correct also. And this word can be applied widely to *paramātman* also. Because it is only *Paramātman* who is visualized after all the inborn defects related to nature in us vanish. The *Atharvaśruti* says that *Ṛk*, *Sāma*, *Yajus* and *Purāṇetihāsas*-all these are born of *Paramātman* and are called by the name *‘Ucchisṭa’*. Also, in the usages of learned persons as in

ॠचस्सामानि यजूंषि पुराणं सेतिहासकम् ।  
उच्छिष्टाज्जज्ञिरे सर्वे भवानेकः शिष्यते शेषरूपः ॥\(भागवत-दशमस्कन्ध\) 

योगाष्टाङ्गैरुज्ज्वलितज्ञानमयाग्नौ दग्ध्वात्मानं ज्ञं परिशिष्च विदुर्यम्” \(श्री शङ्करभगवत्पाद-“हरिमीडे” स्तोत्र\) the words *‘śishta’*, *‘ucchishṭa’*, and *pariśishṭa* which are the derivatives of the same verb root, denote the *paramātman* only. So it is proper that the word *‘ucchishṭa’* has been used as an adjective of God at some places, who is indeed the pure thing that remains after all the attributed defects are gotten rid off.

2\) Observing that *‘Ucchishṭa Gaṇapati’* is described as keeping his trunk in the *yoni* of devi, some have criticized—“This is a vile imagination. It is a mark of the uncultured. Only lustful and gluttonous people have imagined a form of god according to their whims”-This is right, isn’t it?

Answer: - This criticism is certainly not correct. Womb and phallus are *Karmendriyās*, like the hands, feet, tongue and the anus; they are not vile by themselves. Nor are they despicable. If they are used for despicable and evil purposes, they become evil. If they are used naturally and within the parameters of *Dharma*, they become pure only. For example, hands and feet become evil if they are used for beating and kicking innocent persons. The tongue gets degenerated by bad speech. But if these sense organs are used for worshipping god, going to the temple and for praising the lord, they become great, as they are used for commendable endeavours.

“Devotees of god tell this very thing.—‘जिह्वे कीर्तय केशवम्, पाणिद्वन्द्व समर्चय, हरेः गच्छाङ्घ्रियुग्मालयम्” \(*Śrī Kulaśekhara’s mukundamāla stotra*\). So also, no blemish is incurred if good householders use the above private organs for obtaining spiritually inclined progeny, and enjoyment not opposed to *Dharma*, at appropriate times. As they become instruments for only *Dharmasādhana* They become pure. \(“प्रजातिरमृतमानन्द इत्युपस्थे” - तै. उ.\) If *brahmacāris* and *sanyāsis* use them for the above *activities* or even think of such activities, the organs become sinful \(evil\). There is no doubt in the fact that if the energies are not allowed to flow down through the organs, and on the other hand, are drawn upwards through *Dhyāna* etc, they become extraordinarily useful for the *Ātmalābha* of all.

3. Is there proof in the *śāstras* to state that those private organs are pure? Are there details?

Answer: - What is said above is a description conforming to the *Śāstras* only. The genital organs are purified in the ritual of *garbhādhāna* by the *mantras* like विष्णुर्योनिं कल्पयतु त्वष्टा रूपाणि पिग्ंशतु’ \(Let *Vishṇu* create the *yoni*\). In the *tantra Śāstras,* invoking of gods in them and worshipping them \(the gods\) is prescribed. In *mantrayoga, Bijāksharanyāsa* is prescribed in those organs also at the time of *aṅganyāsa*. Scriptures state that after external purification of hands, feet and other organs of action by water and mud, they should be purified specially by the remembrance and worship of *parañjyoti*. The scriptures list the two abovesaid private organs in the same category.

This opinion gets substantiated if one peruses the declaration “वाक् पाणिपादपायूपस्था मे शुद्ध्यान्तां ज्योतिरहं विरजा विपाप्मा भूयासग्ग्ं’ स्वाहा”. made in *virajā’ mantra* of *yājnikī upanisath.* It is indeed lack of judgement to term the above said \(genital\) organs despicable, which are instruments in the *retoyajna*, which \(the *retoyajna*\) the *Vedas* call “यज्ञो हि श्रेष्ठतमं कर्म”

4\) But why are they called private organs?

Answer:- Private organs are the organs which have to be guarded carefully by a person. A person’s natural disposition itself has kept them well guarded. They should be guarded still better. They are called private organs with the intention that a person may cover his shame, should protect them physically, and to see that they do not incense the *samskāras* of the functions of the senses at improper times. They need not be termed as vile organs. By contemplating on god and keeping oneself entertained in profound thoughts, one should take care that they do not get incited at inappropriate times. Learned men say that it is wrong even to think of their downward tendency at improper times. Forgetting this and indulging in wantonness amounts to beastly behaviour.

5\) It is agreeable that *sanyāsis* and *Brahmacaris* who follow *Nivṛittidharma* are supposed to stop the downward flow of the *Guhya Indriyas* completely, and househoulders should use them for *Dharmakāryas* like progency etc as per precepts, at the proper time. But should we suppose such a conduct of *Grhasthadharma* in deities also, whom we worship?

Answer: - Yes. Certainly. Only by envisaging upon such gods who are in that *Dharma*, the *pravṛtti* of house holders becomes really pure.

6\) Are there examples in *Śāstras* for this opinion?

		
Answer: - Yes. Here we may observe the concept of of *‘vaishṇavāgni’* and *‘śāmbhavāgni’* stated in the in *Āgamas*. “One should meditate upon *LakshmīNārāyaṇa* or *Pārvatiparameśvara*, and should \(suppose\) that pure fire was created when *deva* had a union with his *devī* who had a bath after menstruation. Then, *jātakarma* and other sacraments should be performed for that pure *‘agni deva’*, and special fire sacrifices related to *Vishṇu* and *Śiva* should to be performed.”—Say the *Śāstras* clearly.

7\) Do those great deities also perform *garbhādhāna* like humans?

Answer: - Yes, they do. But not like the ordinary humans. With divine *Dharma* they place their infallible and sacred \(semen\) in \(divine\) nature \(*prakṛti*\) and expand their *Dharma*.

“The great nature \(*prakṛti*\) is my womb \(*yoni*\), and I impregnate it”

“O *Brahma*\! You have placed the infalliable seed in water \(which\) is the source of creation”.

\(“मम योनिर्महद् ब्रह्म तस्मिन् गर्भं दधाम्यहम्” “यदमोघमपां बीजमन्तरुप्तमज त्वया”\) are the words of *Bhagavadgīta* and great poets, which declare the above purport.

8\) Don’t those great deities undergo any *vikāra* because of such an impregnation?

Answer: - They have the capacity to evolve their *Dharma* giving no room for any *vikāra* to happen in their own *svarupa Dharma.* The same ideal should be followed by human couples also.

9\) Does the above state exist in supreme gods also all the time?

Answer: - They will not be in that state all the time. Only sometimes they get into such a state. We see that these deities manifest themselves in a posture, with their weapons, *yantras* and beautiful lotuses \(in their hands\) all pointing upwards, and in accordance to these symbols, they with their gaze and gait upwards, keep enjoying the supreme bliss at the highest level, and with a blissful facial image, which is expressive of that \(bliss\). When they are meditated upon in the abovesaid postures, *Yogasiddhi* is obtained.

ऊर्ध्वर्द्वरेतं विरूपाक्षं विश्वरूपाय वै नमः

Those who desire the *Brāhmī* state should meditate on them this way only. “ऊर्ध्वलिङ्गाय नमः” But, for those who desire to perform *Dharmakāryas* there are *upāsanas* which involve the meditation of great deities who are in the *pravṛtti* mode. Even in that state, *upāsana* purity will certainly be there in those forms of deities and their limbs. There won’t be any vile, wicked or unrefined elements in them. Those who worship *ucchishṭa Gaṇapati* for obtaining *Kāma* and *Artha* within the parameters of *Dharma*, should suppose HIM, only with this pure view. Those who don’t have that attitude need not do that *Upāsana*. But they should not have any stained imagination regarding that divine form. The supreme deities, who, though established in the supra sensory state, make their powers flow through the *indriyas* for the sake of gracing the world, without leaving the *Atīndriya* state. So, one should not measure them from a beastly mindset,which has the disposition of reveling only in the sensory world.

10\) We see the forms of *‘Śakti Gaṇapati’*, *Umā Maheshvara* and *Lakshmī**Nārāyaṇa*, only in the posture of embracing their consorts. Do they have such great love for their consorts? Do they appear in the same posture even when they give *darśan* to their devotees outside? Can we get a spiritually elevated state of mind by meditating upon such gods in whom *kāma* is so predominant?

Answer: - The answer to this question can be found in the answers given to the previous questions itself. Still we wish to provide some details. By taking a keen look at those forms of god, one can see that the weapons and the instruments in their hands are pointed upwards. The marks of the *punḍras* are also seen pointing upwards, or, they will be in the shape of *Bindu*, *Kalā* etc, which are sighted in the *Yogabhūmi*. Even his vision has moved above the eyebrows leading to the facial expression of experiencing the *paripūrṇabrahmānanda* described in words such as *‘turīya’*, *‘turīyātīta’* etc., The lotus in the hand of *devī* who is his *sahadharmiṇī* in the *Jnāna Yajna* of God, is also pointing upwards and her *mukhamudra* is stayput in the state of *brāhmī sthiti* in which her husband is immersed. The Lord of Lords, drawing her to himself has embraced her so that she remains within the boundary of *śuddhasamādhi* only, with the auspicious *saṅkalpa* that she \(the *Prakṛti*\) should always be the divine *Prakṛti* and should not flee towards demonical *Prakṛti*. Those who take *darśana* of such divine forms with a pure view, will have their dispositions also rendered divine and dwell in the *Paramātmabhāva* only. Though the weapons and instruments held by some gods are seen pointing downwards, they are the ones which cause the *Paramātmabhāva* that resides above, to descend to the world and take the world \(i.e. the *Jīvas*\) to the state of the supreme spirit that remains in the uppermost regions. Their course is \(ceasing from worldly acts\) *nivṛtti*, or active worldly life in accordance with *nivṛtti*.

We see a story in *Śrīmadbhāgavata*, where a character by name *citraketu* incurred the curse of the goddess when he did not salute the *Brahmajnānamūrtis* i.e. *Pārvatī parameśvara*, and did not behold them with a pure mind, but instead looked at them with a mean view, ridiculed them and ended up taking birth in a demoness.

Thus it becomes clear that nothing base can be found in *ucchishṭa Gaṇapati*, when HIS *darśan* is had with a mindset, refined with \(the study of\) the explanations stated above.

May this *seva* of discussion be offered at the feet of the Lord who is *Ūrdhvareta*, *Virūpāksha* and *Dharma brahma svarūpa.*

		
The *Gaṇeśa mūrti* \(idol\) that is specially worshipped on *Gaṇeśa caturthi* is called *‘VarasiddhiVināyaka’*. We shall explain in brief the modalities of the worship of that Lord *SiddhiVināyakasvāmi.*

Though there are many precepts pertaining to the worship of *Gaṇeśa*, people who worship *‘SiddhiVināyaka’* on *Gaṇeśa caturthi* usually follow the modalities stated in *‘skanda purāṇa’*. Though *Gaṇeśa* himself is the Lord of obstacles, and the remover of obstacle is to be worshipped, he himself is worshipped briefly in the beginning so that no obstacle may come in the way of his worship. After worshipping him with *Shoḍaśopacāras* like *Dhyāna* and *Āvāhana* the special worship is performed.

The *Mahā Gaṇapati* idol made of clay is sprinkled with holy water and consecrated with life force and a prayer is made for his gracious presence in the idol till the *pūja* is completed. Then the doorkeepers are worshipped, the *Mahāyogapitha* is contemplated and the Lord is meditated upon. Pedastals and instruments like *Ādhāraśakti* are contemplated there and worshipped. Then his nine great powers viz - *tīvrā*, *jvalinī*, *nandā*, *bhogadā*, *kāmarūpiṇī*, *ugrā*, *tejovatī*, *satyā*, and *vighnanāśinī* are meditated upon along with his entourage, weapons, vehicles, and ornaments. Then *SiddhiVināyaka* adorned with all these is meditated upon and worshipped.

“The Lord has the trunk of an elephant which is bent towards the left. He is a lustrous form, shining like fire-refined gold, effulgent like a crore of suns, possesses a large body, has four shoulders and one tusk. His four arms are adorned with a noose, a hook, a *Varada Mudrā* and *Abhaya Mudrā*. The tip of his trunk is enjoying the *Modakas*. And he is seated on the *mūshakavāhan* a in the posture of *vīrāsana* or *padmāsana*.” - Keeping these in mind, he should be meditated upon.

“ध्यायेद्गजाननं देवम् तप्तकाञ्चनसन्निभम्  
> चतुर्भुजं महाकायं सूर्यकोटिसमप्रभम् ॥ 

एकदन्तं शूर्पकर्णं दन्तमोदकधारिणम्।  
मोदकासक्ततुण्डाग्रं भगवन्तं विनायकम् ॥  
> पाशाङ्कुशधरं देवं वरदाभयपाणिनम्। 

सर्वाभरणभूषाढ्यं मूषकोपरि संस्थितम् ।  
एवं रूपमिमं देवं ध्यायेत्सिद्धिविनायकम् ।” 

After offering meditation as above, *Āvāhana*, *Āsana*, *Arghya, pādya*, *Ācamanīya*, *madhuparka pañcāmṛta snāna, śuddhodakasnāna*, clothing, *yajnopavīta*, ornaments, *gandha*, *akshatā*, turmeric powder, vermillion powder, saffron powder and flowers are offered in the stipulated order. Among sandal pastes, red coloured paste is dear to *Gaṇeśa*. *Vaidika mantras*, and *ślokas* from devotional literature and *Āgamas* are used in these services. After the twelve parts of his body are worshipped with *Dvādaśanāmas, Arcana* is done with twenty one leaves, as the number twenty one is dear to *Gaṇeśa* in the *tāttvik* sense. Then worship is offered with the leaves of the trees viz. *mācīpatra* \(medicinal plant\), *bṛhatī* \(white egg plant-brinjal\) * bilva* \(bael tree\), *dūrvā* \(*garike*-bent grass\), *dattūrā* \(thorn apple\), *badarī* \(elaci -jujube tree\), *apāmārga* \(*uttaraṇi*- common weed\), *tulasī* \(holy basil\), *cūta* \(mango tree\), *karavīra* \(red oleander\), *Vishṇukrānta* \(small creeping herb \(clitoria ternatea\), *dāḍimī* \(*dalimbe*-pomegranate\), *devadāru* \(deodar\), *maruvaka* \(mint\), *sindhuvāra* \(vitex negundo lin \(shrub\), *jātī* \(*jājī*- jasmine\), *gaṇake* \(pot herb solarium indicum\), *śamī* \(*banni*-prosopis spicigera lin tree\), *aśvattha* \(*araḷi*-peepul tree\), *arjuna* \(*matti*-terminalia tomentosa\), and *arka* \(*ekka* - swallow wart\). In place of some of the above leaves, the leaves of *bhṛngarāja* \(*garaga*- common weed- eclipta alba hassk\), *Āśmātaka*, *kalmaragi*, and *gandalīka* \(*baḷḷigarike*- white bent grass\) are also used.

		
In the worship of *Gaṇeśa* with twentyone types of leaves, there is a custom of including *Tuḷasī* also generally. But most people do not pay attention to the aspect that it is forbidden for the worship of *Gaṇeśa*. The *purāṇās* clearly say “All deities dwell in *tulasi*. It is dear to all *devatās* and especially to *Nārāyaṇa*. But it is forbidden only in the worship of *Gaṇeśa.*

> यत्रैकस्तुलसीवृक्षः तिष्ठति द्विजसत्तम ।  
> तत्रैव त्रिदशास्सर्वे ब्रह्मविष्णुशिवादयः ॥  
केशवः पत्रमध्येषु पत्राग्रेषु प्रजापतिः ।  
पत्रवृन्ते शिवस्तिष्ठेत्तुलस्याः सर्वदैव हि ॥  
लक्ष्मीः सरस्वती चैव गायत्री चूतिका तथा ।  
शची चान्या देवपत्न्यः तत्पुष्पेषु वसन्ति वै॥\(पद्मपुराण, क्रियायोगसार\) 

*Gaṇeśa vākyam*: -

पत्राणां सारभूता त्वं भविष्यसि मनोरमे ।  
कलांशेन महाभागे स्वयं नारायणप्रिया ॥  
प्रिया त्वं सर्वदेवानां कृष्णस्य च विशेषतः ।  
पूजा विमुकिदा नृणां मम त्याज्या च सर्वदा ॥\(ब्रह्मवैवर्त-गणेशखण्ड\) 

As there is a clear statement prohibiting the use of *tulasī*, it is better to use some other appropriate leaf in it’s place, in the worship of *Gaṇeśa*.

The *purāṇās* quote *Gaṇeśa* telling *Tulasī* “I do not love you. You also have no desire in me”.

“The fragrance and touch of *tulasī* are not agreeable for the worship of *Gaṇeśa*. They cause an adverse effect. They do not open up the spiritual centers pertaining to *Gaṇeśa* in the body”.—This is the purport of the statements. We should note here that all the leaves used in worship are excellent medicinal herbs and, in the view of both the *Āyurveda* and *yogaŚāstra* which happens to be the spiritual part of \(*Ayurveda*\), they are superior medicinal herbs.

After the worship with leaves, *Gaṇeśa* is worshipped with twentyone flowers viz., *karavīra* \(*kaṇigile*-oleander\), *jāji* \(jasmine\), *campaka* \(*sampige*-yellow fragrant flower\), *vakuḷa* \(*pagade*-minusops elengi lin\), *mālatī* \(a kind of jasmine\), *ketaki* \(*tāḷe*- fragrant screw pine\), *kalhāra* \(*sougandhika*- white water lily\), *kunda* \(*molle*- a kind of jasmine\), *atasī* \(agase- flower of flax\), *kirikarṇikā* \(*śankha*\), *pārijāta* \(night jasmine\), *Sevantikā* \(chrysanthemum\), *sugandharāja* \(fragrant flower of tuberosa\), *japā* \(*dāsavāḷa*-china rose\), *kuravanṭikā* \(*goranṭi*- yellow *amaranth*\), *nandyāvarta* \(*nandibaṭṭalu*- white flowers-tabernaemontana corneria br.\), *droṇapushpa* \(*thumbe*-lukus linifolia\), *mallikā* \(*mallige*-jasminum samabac ait\) and *sugandhikamala* \(fragrant lotus\). *Dūrva* \(panic or bent grass\). *Japākusuma* among leaves and *dāsavāḷa*- \(China rose\) among flowers are most dear to *Gaṇeśa*. When suitable flowers and leaves happen to be unavailable, this *dūrva* and *japākusuma* may be used in their place for the worship of *Gaṇeśa*.

After the worship with flowers, *Gaṇeśa* is worshipped with *dvādaśa nāmāvaḷi*, *ashtottara nāmāvaḷī*, *ashtottarasahasranāmāvaḷī* etc and then *Dhūpa*, *dīpa* and *naivedya* are offered in the prescribed order.

In the *Naivedya pūja*, items such as *modaka*, *apūpa, cakkuli*, *pṛthuka* and eatables prepared using green gram, *eLLunḍe*, different kinds of fruits, sugar cane juice, curds, milk, honey, ghee and sugar etc should be offered as *mahā naivedya.* The *naivedya* offered should be tasty with six *rasas* \(salt, sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and astringent\). Among these, *Modaka* is most dear to the Lord.

**Here we respectfully recall the words of *Śrīraṅgagurudeva* who said- “*Modaka* means a thing that brings happiness, joy and delight. “*mudā karāttamodakam sadā vimuktisādhakam***”. If that special dish is prepared with the right combination of ingredients and offered to the god of gods and later taken as *prasāda*, it not only causes delight to the senses but also helps to experience suprasensory joy i.e. \(*paramātmamoda*\) by *Dhātu prasannatā.* As is evident from the scriptural words—“सात्विकाः मधुरप्रियाः” “मुमुक्षोः माधुर्यम्”, this *‘madhurarasa’* is helpful for *Mokshadharma*. For this very reason *Śrī śaṅkarabhagavatapāda* has sung the praise of God, bracketing *Modaka* and *Vimukti* together “*mudā karāttamodakam, sadā vimukthisādhakam*”. The number of *modaka-naivedya* to be offered to *Gaṇeśa* is twenty one. The following *śloka* indicates the special place of *modaka* among the other items of *naivedya*.

एकविंशतिसङ्खयाकान् मोदकान् घृतपाचितान् ।  
नैवेद्यं सफलं दद्यां नमस्ते विघ्ननाशिने ॥ 

Afterwards the following viz.,-*karodvartana*, offering *phala* \(fruits\), *tāmbūla* \(betel leaf rolled with betel nut, spices and caustic lime\), *suvarṇapushpa* \(golden flower\), *bhūshaṇa* \(ornaments\), *uttaranīrājana*, *mantrapushpa, dūrvāsahitapushpāñjali* \(offering flowers along with bent grass with both hands\), *pradakshiṇanamaskāra* \(offering salutation-obeisance with circumambulation\), *pūrṇa phala* and *dakshiṇā* \(sacrificial fee\) are offered. And then the desired things are prayed for. After this, services like *chatra* \(parasol\), *cāmara* \(the bushy tail of the yak\), *nṛtya* \(dance\), *gīta* \(singing of songs\), *vādya* \(instrumental music\), *stotra* \(hymns of praise\), *Āndolikā* \(palanquin\), *aśvavāhana* \(riding horse carriage\), *gajavāhana* \(riding elephant carriage\) etc are offered in keeping with one’s ability and devotion, either directly or in the form of *Saṅkalpa*.

How many circumambulations should be done in the worship of Gaṇeśa? We come across the custom of this *Pradakshiṇa* being done either once, thrice, four times or seven times, as per one’s practice and tradition. But scriptures state that the number of circumambulations should be conforming to the *devatā bheda*. The rule depends on how many circumambulations occur in the deep meditation done upon that \(particular\) deity in the inner spiritual world.

Three circumambulations have been prescribed for *Gaṇeśa* and *pitṛs*. In some *kalpas* only one circumambulation to *Gaṇeśa* is stated.

‘एकवारमेव ते प्रदक्षिणं प्रशस्यते’. The number of circumambulations is one to *durgā devī*, seven to *sūrya* \(sun\), three to *Vināyaka*, four to *Nārāyaṇa* and *ardhapradakshiṇa* to *Śiva* according to the following *śloka*.

एका चण्ड्या रवेः सप्त तिस्रः कार्या विनायके ।  
हरेश्चतस्रः कर्तव्याः शिवस्यार्धप्रदक्षिणा ॥ 

After the worship is completed the idol of *Vināyaka* together with a pair of clothes and *prasāda* are gifted to a worthy recipient. This is called *‘upāyanadāna’*. That dana will be *Sāttvika dāna*, only when the presenter does away with pride and egotism, and entertains the feeling that all the three i.e. the donor, the donee and the bestower of the fruit of *dāna*, are that almighty only. This *upāyanadāna* is prescribed in the *vratas* of all the deities. By such a kind of gifting the donor will have his desires fulfilled well. The recipient will also remain unaffected from *pratigrahadosha*. The *ślokas* related to *upāyanadāna* as a part of *Vināyaka pūja*, are note worthy here:—

“विनायकस्य प्रतिमां वस्त्रयुग्मेन वेष्टिताम् ।  
तुभ्यं दास्यामि विप्रेन्द्र गणेशः प्रीयतां मम ॥  
गणेशः प्रतिगृह्णातु गणेशो वै ददाति च ।  
गणेशस्तारकोऽस्माकं गणेशाय नमो नमः ॥” 

When the *udvāsana* is done, an auspicious desire will be there as follows:- “May that god who is pleased with the worship, grant the fulfillment of our desires and may HE return again at the time of auspicious worship”

“यान्तु देवगणास्सर्वे पूजामादाय मत्कृताम् ।  
इष्टकाम्यार्थसिद्ध्यर्थं पुनरागमनाय च ॥  
यथासुखं यथास्थानं उद्वासयामि,  
शोभनार्थं क्षेमाय पुनरागमनाय च” 

During *udvāsana* the idol of god is moved a little to the right, with the abovesaid contemplation. This is an indication of the movement of circumambulation which is in accordance with the path of the gods and we think it is appropriate to quote it here for performing *visarjana*.

1. There is a custom of offering *Prasannārghy* a to the Lord at the end of worship and then *udvāsana* is done. As we know, *Arghya* will have been offered earlier already during *shoḍaśopacārapūja*. Thus, a question may arise “Then why this offering of *Arghya* again at the end?” The answer to that question lies in the distinct name of *arghya* itself. The offering of *upacāras* like *Arghya* etc is performed to please god himself. That is, to obtain his grace. God has been already pleased by the offering of those services. By the grace of god who is pleased, we too will have obtained *Dhātuprasannatā* and tranquility of the mind. In this ambience, *Prasannārghya* is the service offerred by us with pleased senses and mind and with gratitude to the Lord who is pleased.

2. Now, let us take up the auspicious send off of the Lord, which is performed next. After the *udvāsana* is done at the place of worship, the idol is taken in a procession, with auspicious musical instruments like the \(sound of\) the bell etc, in the streets with the pomp one can afford, and is later immersed in the water of either a river, lake, lotus pond, well or a reservoir of water. There is a custom of performing a brief worship to god again at the bank of the reservoir, before immersing \(his idol\) in water. One may ask - Already *Udvāsana* has been done as per precepts and \(the idol\) has been moved from the place of worship. Once the *Udvāsana* is done as per precepts, the *Devatāsānnidhya* will not be there at all. So, is it not a waste to offer worship to the idol near the reservoir which has no *DevathāSānnidhya*? But it has to be noted that the *Udvāsana* performed earlier happens to be the last *Upacāra*. But that itself is not the auspicious completion of the worship. Thereafter, and also till the immersion of the idol, the *devatāsānnidhya* in the idol will be very much there. The *upasamhāra* of the divine force will not have occurred yet. That is why all the pomp of the *Maṅgalavādya* continues midway also, during the procession of the idol up to the reservoir.

The *Devatāsānnidhya* gets withdrawn from it after the final *Udvāsana* is done with the hymn

> अभ्यारमिदद्रयो निषिक्तं पुष्करेमधु ।  
अव तस्य विसर्जने ॥ ॠग्वेद 8-7-11 

This \(explanation\) happens to be the answer to the question raised above, regarding the offering of worship once again before letting off of the idol in the reservoir, which \(i.e. the worship\) is indeed appropriate.

Some have asked us a question:-

3. “These days rivers, lakes, wells and other reservoirs of water are not available in villages or cities. So people immerse the idol in water that is filled in buckets and other vessels. Is this correct?” Our answer is, it should be done only when it is inevitable and this is only an *Āpatkalpa*. Reservoirs of water such as rivers, tanks, ponds, and wells must be there in all the villages and cities for the use of people who practice *Dharma*. If there are no natural reservoirs, artificial large reservoirs should be constructed. They should be kept full to the brim and clean. This is an important rule pertaining to the building of a village or city. ***Śrīgurudeva* used to tell that dwelling places without the above arrangements, are *Kugrāmas* and *Kutsitanagarīs*.**

When such reservoirs do not have water as a result nature’s fury, one may immerse the idol made of clay in a vessel filled with pure water. After the idol gets dissolved in that water, the water should be let in some clean place.

4. Some devotees ask - “*SvarnaGaurī vrata* is celebrated along with *Gaṇeśa caturthī vrata* and the idol of *Gaurīdevi* is also installed along with the idol of *Gaṇeśa*. Should the idol of *Gaurī* be placed by the side of the idol of *Gaṇeśa* or should it be placed at a higher level?” We do not find any *Śāstravākyas* in this regard. But as *Gaurī* is renowned as the mother of *Gaṇeśa*, it is proper to keep her idol at a level a little higher than that of *Gaṇeśa*. If there is lack of space to do so, the idol of *Gaṇeśa* may be placed in front of the idol of *Gaurī* or by the side of it, and this won’t amount to any offence either. Nevertheless, the sentiment that *Gaurī* is the revered mother of *Gaṇeśa*, should be unceasing.

5. Some people ask “Should *Gaurī* be worshipped after installing her separately, or, should she be worshipped along with *Gaṇapati*?” When the festivals of *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* fall on different days, the *prāṇapratishthā* and worship must be done separately for the two. The *pūja* and *prāṇapratishṭhā* may be done together. Both of them may be placed in the same altar and worshipped, because the relationship between *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* is very profound one. It is renowned that *Gaṇeśa* is the elder son and the dearest son of *Gaurī*. We have noted earlier that even though the day of worship of *Gaṇeśa* is *caturthī*, it will be most commendable if that *caturthī* is touched by *Tṛtīya*, which is the day of *pūja* of *Gaurī*. But there is nothing wrong in worshipping them in different altars. Worshipping of *Gaurī* among *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* by all is not in vogue. *Gaurī pūja* is specially performed for *saumaṅgalya-saubhāgya.* Women perform this worship specially. Men also may worship the auspicious goddess *Gaurī* for the welfare of the family. *SiddhiVināyaka* is worshipped for the \(removal of obstacles\)- and *vidyālābha* \(the benefit of spiritual and material knowledge\). As there is *Devatābheda* here, *prāṇa pratishṭhā* of both must be done.

1.“As a part of *svarṇaGaurī vrata, devī* is invoked either in a *Kalaśa* or *sand* and worshipped. Then the idol of *Gaurī* idol made of clay is placed along with that of *Gaṇeśa* and worshipped without *prāṇa pratishṭa.* Is it right?” is the question of some. Worshipping an idol without performing *prāṇa pratishṭā* does not have the consent of the *Śāstrās*. If *devi* has to be worshipped in the idol also, then the rite of *prāṇapratishṭha* should be done for the idol also.

7. Again some ask a question - “There is a custom of worshipping *Gaurī* in a *Kalaśa* in which a lemon or a coconut is placed. Which is better? Placing a lemon or a coconut?” Our answer is as follows: True. Lemon is a great fruit. *Pitta* is reduced by seeing, touching and taking it \(as juice or in food items\). The tranquility of mind necessary for the *pūja* is obtained thereby. Placing a coconut in a *kalaśa* also is best. Because, coconut is a *‘pūrṇa phala’.* It is a wish yielding fruit. It is “*trinetra-hara sammata*”. There is no doubt that it is an auspicious thing which represents the cheek and the head of a *brahmajnāni*. If possible, one may place both a coconut and a lemon in \(or on\) the *Kalaśa*. If that is not possible, at least the coconut should be placed.

8. Some people have a question “Should *Gaṇeśa* be given a send off along with *Gaurī devi* on a day which is pure with the suitable *Tithi, vāra* etc? Or should suitable days be found for both”?—We have the following answer to this-

Those who perform the *uttarapūja* at night on the day of worship, do the *visarjana* of both \(i.e. of *Gaurī* or *Gaṇeśa*\) on the same night without looking for the purity of the day. This is an unavoidable option. But if one can be afford, it is better to perform the concluding worship separately, and then do the *visarjana* in water. If one is doing *visarjana* this way, the purity of the day has to be found for both. When both *Gaṇeśa* and *Gaurī* are installed together, the custom of finding a good day for performing *Visarjana* of *Gaurī* and immersing both *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* on the same day is in vogue. *Visarjana* of *Gaurī devī* is not done on Tuesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays. On Tuesdays neither *Gaurī* nor *Gaṇeśa* are immersed in water. *Friday* is not a prohibited day for the *visarjana* of *Gaṇeśa*.

There is a custom of doing *visarjana* of *Gaurī* and *Gaṇeśa* together, if they are worshipped together. *Visarjana* of *Gaṇeśa* is done on the same day as the *visarjana* of *Gaurī devī* after finding an auspicious day. Then, *Visarjana* for both is done on that day, which happens to be an odd day \(like the first, third, fifth days etc\) counted from the day of installation of *Gaurī*, and at the same time, the day should be good with the required *Śuddhi*. So, more importance to *Gaurī*, as far as *Dina niyama* and *Vāra niyama* are concerned. The rules forbidding travel on Tuesdays and Fridays apply specially to women.

9. Some people question—“What is the significance of the form, the dress, ornaments and retinue etc of *SiddhiVināyaka*?—We would like to give an abridged answer as follows:-

*SiddhiVināyaka* is a divne form and a matter of inner realization of the *jnanis*. The purport of his form, true form and glory are-Lordship over twenty one *tattvas*, removal of obstacles, and the ability to grant knowledge *\(Vidhyālābha*\) and prosperity and other benefits.

Present day people are conjuring up different physical meanings for his trunk, tusk, head, carriage, ornaments etc in an arbitrary way. Some others are interpreting them to suit the philosophical systems they follow like *dvaita, advaita*, and *viśishṭādvaita* etc. Making use of the deity to suit one’s philosophy has also been done.

So, we shall now take note of the messages that are conveyed by God through his divine auspicious form, divine weapons, divine ornaments, divine vehicle and devine retinue etc., which are comprehensible to all the *Yoganubhavis* in the *yogabhūmi*. The divine form of *Gaṇeśa* which is in a triangle pointing upwards \(*Ūrdhvamukha*\) is the form of *praṇava* itself. Especially the curve of his trunk is the divine form of *praṇava*. “ॐकाराकृतिवक्रतुण्डम्”. If his trunk is bent to the left, it is *bhogaprada* and if it is bent to the right, it is *mokshaprada.* His sacred single tusk \(*Ekadanta*\) is the pure divine knowledge that manifests to the focussed mind “अमलज्ञानैकदन्तम्”

The serpent which is his ornament is nothing but *kunaḍalinī* which is renowned in the *Yogaśāstra*. The *pāśa* is the noose of delusion of the three *guṇas* that binds \(the soul\) to the worldly life. He is a supreme*yogi* who keeps under control the infatuated mind elephant which is agitated, with his hook. The weapon *‘śakti’* held by him is nothing but his natural supreme power \(*mahā śakti*\). And that hook is an instrument that keeps under check all the powers, so that they may not cross their bounds. *Siddhi, Buddhi*, *vallabhā* and others who are considered his wives are also his divine powers. The \(*modaka*\) in his hand represents his supreme bliss and it proclaims *muktānanda*. “मुदाकरात्त मोदकं सदा विमुक्तिसाधकम्” The lotuses held by him and his divine consorts, represent the *‘mūlādhāra’* lotus which is their auspicious abode. His big belly proclaims the twenty one *tattvas* which are under his reign. The mouse which is his carriage, is the *śakti* of obstacles that are always under his control either in use or in withdrawl. Riding on them. He exercises complete power to use and withdraw them at will, at any place and time.

We offer our salutations to that Lord *SiddhiVināyaka* who is an embodiment of *tattva*, and who is endowed with form, appearance, dress, ornaments, carriage, divine weapons, retinue etc which are full of *tattvas*, and we wish auspiciousness \(to all\).





	 
## Gaurī Festival

*Gaurī* Festival is one of the most important *parvas* that comes in the month of *Bhādrapada*. Though it is generally known as *‘Gaurī Habba’*, the *śāstraic* name happens to be *‘SvarṇaGaurīvrata’*. This is because this festival is unique and has distinct features compared to other *vratas* pertaining to *Gaurī* such as *‘Saubhāgyagaurī’*, *‘Sampadgaurī’, ‘maṅgalagaurī’, ‘Lāvaṇyagaurī’, ‘Trilocanagaurī’, ‘Gajagaurī’* etc. Though all these are *Gaurī* festivals, *‘SvarṇaGaurīvrata’* is the most famous of these, and the practice of calling only this as *‘Gaurī festival’* is in vogue. It is like the ordinary people calling the *saṅkramaṇa* of *makara māsa* only as *‘saṅkranti’* specially, even though *saṅkramaṇas* occur every month. Likewise, this festival which is special, is called as *‘Gaurīvrata’*. All over India, people in large numbers celebrate this festival.

Lay persons distinguish festivals, as festivals of males and festivals of females. From this view point *upākarma* is a festival of men and *‘Gaurī* festival’ *‘Varamahālakshmī’* etc. are festivals of women. It is because, it is women who actually worship in *Gaurī* and *Varamahālakshmī* festivals. In these festivals the enthusiasm and rapture of women are more. But this is a \(cursory\) grossdivision. Because, in these exclusive festivals of women, men also have to offer respects through *namaskāras* etc to *Gaurī* and *Lakshmī*. They should help women with inspired devotion in worshipping these goddesses. Both men and women have responsibility in celebrating festivals. Here, we would like to recall the nectar like words of ***ŚrīGurudeva***, who had the complete comprehension of the worship of the deities. Men should not ignore worship of *Gaurī* excusing themselves, as is evident from the adage *“Ganḍasigeke Gaurīḍuhkha”* \(why should men have *Gaurī* Problems?\) Women too should not keep men \(away from\) *Gaurī* worship. Because, goddess *Gaurī* did not remain exclusively alone, but became the mother of all, only after marrying *Śiva*. She became the mother of both men and women. All the men and women in this world, are virtually the two parts of the first couple of the universe, who are in the form of *Ardhanārīshvara*, “स्त्रीपुंसौ आत्मभागौ ते भिन्नमूर्तेः सिसृक्षया”. Therefore, it is the responsibility of both men and women to worship both *Śiva* and *Pārvati*.”

They being together as the first couple of the world, known as *Lakshmī Nārāyaṇa* and *Pārvatiparameśvara* is indeed a joint account. *Lakshmī* and *Nārāyaṇa* can never separate from each other. So also is the case with *Pārvatiparameśvara*. The worship offered to the *paramapurusha* in *Umeśa* or *Rameśa* will naturally reach *parāprakṛti.* The service or \(worship\) offered to *parāprakṛti* should be offered to the *paramapurusha* also. They have equal role in the deed of creation. *Purusha* needs the help of *prakṛti* for his multiplication. What should *prakṛti* foster? She should foster “*Purusha* the *jnānasvarūpa”*. And for this, her desire for *purusha* is indispensable indeed. As the saying goes, “जगज्जनन्यै जगदेकपित्रे” equal importance is there for the worship of both of them. As all the living beings, male and female, are parts of those two, both men and women have the right to worship both of them.

***Śrīgurudeva*** used to cite an example from a story in the *purāṇas*, which tells how a person may have to suffer from shortcomings, if he happens to discriminate worship between *Paramapurusha* and *Paraprakṛti*. Once, a question arose as to who was greater of the two i.e. *Pārvati* and *Śiva*. When this question was raised everyone in the *‘Śivagaṇa’* kept silent. But *Bhṛṅgi* stood up and declared—*‘Śiva* indeed is greater’. *Pārvatī* got indignant, and drained him of all the seven pure elements and other aspects of dispositions which she had granted him earlier. That is why the devotee of *Śiva Bhṛṅgi* is shown in pictures only as a skeleton”. This is the story.

Thus, although *purusha* and *prakṛti* have equal importance, on some occasions, they are worshipped separately for the purpose of obtaining distinct *Purushārthas.* For example, we come across *pūjākalpas* where the *‘Śakti* part of the Lord present in the form of *ŚrīGaurī*, *Sarasvati* etc. is worshipped specially, for the accomplishment of purity of disposition, which is required for the attainment of wealth, fortune, knowledge, arts, *jnāna* and detatchment. Though one’s mind is focussed on *Śakti* alone in these \(*pūjās*\) for the purpose of accomplishments, it should not be forgotten that the ultimate aim of all the above *siddhis* is the *Purushasvārūpa* only, and, by the worship of *Devī* he is also pleased. And, *Gaurīpūjā* is one among such *Devīpūjākalpas*.

How did the custom of worship of *Devī* come into practice? Why did it come? With regard to these points we have noted above the vision of the *Sanātana Ārya Bhāratīya* sages who clearly visualized the *devas* and *devīs* and wholeheartedly bestowed upon the world that supreme truth. Some western scholars who have with a narrow mind, done comparative study and research of religions that have evolved in different parts of the world, expound a strange opinion about the origins of the worship of *devī*. Though that opinion carries no profound critical assessment, we refer to it here as a *purvapaksha*, as it has captured the minds of many thinkers now a days.

“In days of yore, the *Ādimānavas* had to live only on animal meat, fruits and roots available in the forest. Men had to trek long distances during those days, for hunting and collecting other eatables. They were staying outside their homes during most part of the day. As women stayed \(back\) in homes most of the time, the children happened to be educated by women only. They started considering women alone as goddesses and started worshipping them. So the worship of *Devī* started this way”.

“Dravidians lived in India well before the Aryans. They were the ones who worshipped *‘māri’*, *masaṇi* and other goddesses. Their families were matriarchal. Aryans who came to India later, defeated Dravidians and established their empire. They were worshipping *indra*, *agni* and only other male gods. When they later mixed with Dravidians, goddesses were also included in their worship. Even to this day, the Aryans follow the patriarchal system”-This is the summary of the opinion of those western scholars.

Though this opinion appears fine when looked at superficially, it does not become a conclusion based on truth. Because

		 
1. they have not viewed this subject from the threefold levels viz *Ādhyātmika, Ādhidaivika* and *Ādhibhautika*. They have neither done any *upāsana*. But they have put forth an opinion which has emerged from a mere intellectual gymnastics. 
2. They have disregarded the \(hymns\) appearing in *Vedic* literature, viz., *Sarasvatīsūkta, Devīsūkta, Medhāsūkta, Indrāṇīṛk* etc. which expound the glories of *devīs*. 
3. In the culture of great sages, the matter of assigning either equality or a distinct importance for men and women, both at home and in the society, depends on their dispositions and distinct capacities, which are *daivadatta*. When one takes into consideration all these matters, \(it will be learnt that both\) have equal importance. They are the two parts of the divine body of the creator. They are forms of *Śiva* and *Śakti*. If the father is the heaven \(*dyuloka*\), the mother is the earth \(*pṛthivī*\). If the father is *sāma* \(the third *veda*\) mother is the \(*Ṛk*\) \(“सामाहमस्मि ॠक्त्वम्” द्यौः पिता पृथिवी माता”\) They have never cared to study the purport of the *Vedamantras* at all. They have not taken into account the fact that all the vedic gods are *Śakti viśishṭas* only. 
4. Above all, the mystery of *devi*, as is evident from, “गुहा त्रीणि निहिता नेङ्गयन्ति” can be known only to *jnānis* who enter the cave of wisdom, and not to those who indulge in intellectual exercises focussed on what just appears externally. Therefore it is no wonder that western scholars give such strange opinions on the subject. If such views are given importance in the land of *maharshi* traditions, it can only be termed lamentable 

The next question is who is this *Gaurī* worshipped during *SvarṇaGaurī vrata*? Why should she be worshipped?

The name *‘Gaurī’* is a synonym for *Pārvatīdevī*. She is the divine consort of *Mahādeva* who has in his authority, mainly the last one among creation, sustenance and dissolution. She is his beloved, and half of his form. At the time of destruction she becomes *‘Kāli’* adorning the black colour. While blessing people with knowledge, she becomes *Shyāmalambika*, assuming a dark complexion. She becomes the effulgent *Gaurī*, adorning the colour of the *Campaka* flower or pure white colour of snow, while bestowing prosperity and conjugal felicity. The very meaning of the word *Gaurī* is a woman who has the complexion of a *Campaka* or the one who is fair complexioned. “गौरः वर्णः अस्ति अस्थाः इति गौरी” “चाम्पेयगौरार्धशरीरकायै”

“योगाग्निदग्धदेहा सा पुनर्जाता हिमालये ।  
> शङ्खेन्दुकुन्दधवला ततो गौरीति सा स्मृता ॥” 

And, *Lalitādevī*, *Umā*, *Ekaparnā*, *Shākambharī*, *Rājarājeśvarī*, *Tripurasundarī* etc happen to be her other forms pertaining to her diverse functions.

Among the *Śaktipīthas*, her main abode is *kānyakubja*.

> गौरी प्रोक्ता कान्यकुब्जे रम्भा तु मलयाचले \(देवीभागवत 7-30-58\) 

Which particular *purushārtha* is obtained by worshipping her?

*Sarasvatī, Lakshmī* and *Gaurī* are the divine consorts of the trinity \(i.e. *Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Maheśvara*\) respectively. All the three have the power to directly grant all the *purushārthas*, or by *paramparā* also \(i.e. one after the other\). Because, these \(*devis*\) are the various forms of the very *ParāŚakti* \(supreme power\).

> गीर्देवतेति गरुडध्वजसुन्दरीति शाकम्भरीति शशिशेखरवल्लभेति ।  
> सृष्टिस्थितिप्रलयकेलिषु संस्थितायै तस्मै नमस्त्रिभुवनैकगुरोस्तरुण्यै॥ 

But each of these is worshipped for obtaining different benefits. And *Gaurī* is worshipped especially for the fortune of good marital happiness.

“विद्याकामस्तु गिरिशं दाम्पत्यार्थम् उमां सतीम्” \(भागवत, तृतीय स्कन्ध 7\) 

This *Sarvamaṅgalādevi* \(all auspicious goddess\) is worshipped for obtaining a suitable husband, and for *Saumaṅgalyasiddhi,* permanent love of the husband.

The story of *Rukmiṇidevī* and *Gopikās* worshipping *Gaurī* to obtain *Śrīkṛshṇa* as their husband and also to become his favourite, is well known.

> हेमन्ते प्रथमे मासि नन्दव्रजकुमारिकाः ।  
> चेरुर्रविष्यं भुञ्जानाः कात्यायन्यर्चनव्रतम् ।  
> . . . . नन्दगोपसुतं देवि पतिं मे कुरु ते नमः ॥ \(भागवत 10-22\) 

> नमस्ये त्वाम्बिकेभीक्ष्णं स्वसन्तानयुतां शिवाम् ।  
> भूयात् पतिर्मे भगवान् कृष्णस्तदनुमोदताम् ॥ \(भागवत 10-53\) 

Even today, the practice of worshipping *Gaurī* during wedding ceremonies for *tāḷibhāgya* is well known. Her various divine and auspicious names such as “*Śivā, Sarvamaṅgalā, Mṛḍānī, Śarvāṇī* and *Ambikā”* etc, are exemplar of her *Māṅgalya Śakti*.

Who is this *Gaurī*?

This question may sound childish to those who worship Gods, and to those who have at least a little knowledge of the *Purāṇas*, *Itihāsas*, and *Kāvyas*. This is because even ordinary people know that *Garī* is *Śivā*, the wife of *Śiva*. It is also well known that she is called by names such as *Pārvatī*, *Umā*, *Durgā, Bhavānī*, *Kāthyāyini, Aparṇā Ambikā* and many other divine names.

		
We see that she is referred to as *Nārāyaṇa’s* sister, just as she is called the wife of *Śiva*.

“नारायणानुजा देवी वैष्णवी विजयाम्बिका” 

We see pictures and sculptures where *Vishṇu* is depicted as celebrating the wedding of his sister *Gaurī* with *Śiva* \(known as\) *Sundareśvara*.

There is also an opinion that *Gaurī* is the mother of all the worlds and is served by both *Sarasvatī* and *Lakshmī*.

“वन्दे मातरमम्बिकां भगवतीं वाणीरमासेविताम्” 

Contrary to this, we can see that she is described as the daughter-in-law of *Brahma* the son of *Vishṇu*, and as a slave of *Mahālakshmī*, and also her devotee. And that she is the wife of *Śiva* and got her power by a small grace of *Mahālakshmī*.

> ब्रह्मेशादिसुरव्रजस्सदयितस्त्वद्दासदासीगणः ।  
> श्रीरित्येव च नाम ते भगवति ब्रूमः कथं त्वां वयम् ॥ 

श्रीमन्मन्दकटाक्षलब्धविभव ब्रह्मेन्द्रगङ्गाधराम् ।  
> त्वां त्रैलोक्यकुटुम्बिनीम् भगवतीम् वन्दे मुकुन्दप्रियाम् ॥ 

We see the above statements in the *stotras* of *Pārvatī* and *Lakshmī*.

Thus, it sounds very strange to call the same *Gaurī* at different contexts as a mistress of some divine woman, as her slave and as the wife of her grandson.

The confusion does not stop here. *Gaurī* who had been clearly described as the divine consort of *Śiva*, is also called the sister of *Rudra* by *Śrutivākyas* also.

> सह स्वस्राम्बिकया, आखुस्ते पशुः 

So, did *Rudra* marry his own sister?” There are some who ridicule—“Why not? Have not the *purāṇas* stated that *Brahma* married his own daughter? This is also like that. These Hindu gods have no ethics at all.”

“One need not have to deride like that. Brothers and sisters, sons and daughters and mother and son should not marry each other. It is very abhoring. One should not even think of it even in the mind. But ethics like these and discipline didn’t exist in the early days of civilization \(Because this kind of ethics is not seen in animals\!\) The above said stories of the strange marriages of *Brahma* and *Rudra* are the remains of the beginning era of civilization”-We see such pacifying and peacemaking commentaries exuding from researcher degree holders in history.

As though the above confusion is not enough, we see some opinions that not only describe *Gaurī, Lakshmī* and *Sarasvatī* as mother and daughter mutually, but that they have the same true form\!

> गीर्देवतेति गरुडध्वजसुन्दरीति  
> शाकम्भरीति शशिशेखरवल्लभेति 

There is also a statement that *Gāyatrī, Sāvitrī* and *Sarasvatī* are the wives of *Brahma*, *Rudra* and *Vishṇu* respectively.

> प्रातर्मध्यदिने तथास्तसमये ब्राह्मी तथा शाम्भवी  
> वैष्णव्यात्मसमस्तसेवकजनान् कुर्यात्सदामङ्गलम् 

There is also an opinion that among these three, only one is *jagajjanani* \(mother of the universe\). And the remaining two are her \(glories\).

To Continue the confusion further, *Devī Purāṇa* states “*Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Maheshvara* are the sons of *Ādimahāśakti*. “ब्रह्मा विष्णुश्च रुद्रश्च जगद्धात्रि सुतास्तव”.

“Is it not possible that the same soul, in different births can become the father, the mother, the son, the daughter, the wife and the daughter-in-law to other souls? So also is the relationship of gods and goddesses.”—This is the easy philosophical solution some try to provide, in reply to the above contradictory statements. If this can be acceptable, a question may again arise. “If gods and goddesses are souls that can be subjected to births and rebirths based on *karma* like we people, why should we worship them? We can as well worship ourselves\!”

Above all this, some raise one more objection—“The god of your *Vedas*, *Purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* can never become *Nirañjana Paramātma* \(at all\). Because he too like we mortals, has emcumberances such as wife, children, daughter-in-law etc,” When such questions and objections cause disturbance in the mind, the devotion and faith essential for the worship of *Gaurī* get slackened. Therefore it is necessary that we have to find satisfactory answers pertaining to these.

The above gods and goddesss viz. *Śivapārvatī, Vishṇulakshmī* and *Brahmasarasvatī* are all matters, which are beyond the human senses. So, it is not at all correct to arrive at a conclusion by discussing those matters using the worldly yardsticks based on senses. None of the questions and answers that arise in the world of senses can be honestly in harmony with that \(suprasensory\) field.

When viewed through the eyes of *Maharshis*, *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Maheshvara* are the evolved forms of the *Parañjyothi Paramapurusha*, and, *Vāṇi, Ramā* and *Gaurī* are the evolved forms of his *Parāprakṛtī*. *Paramātma* is the \(father\) who provides the seed of creation. *Prakṛtī* is the *Kshetra* which causes the expansion of his *saṅkalpa*. It is essential to do *Yogasādhana* to comprehend the *Prakāsa Svarūpa* and the evolutionary forms of that *Bhagavān* and *Bhagavatī*. At different stages of this *sādhana* we see the *Paramapurusha* and *Prakṛtī* variously as wife-husband, father-mother, brother-sister, and god and goddess etc. These views help us to focus the mind on them with a feeling of supreme love for them. Actually speaking, we have to term the *paramātma* as the Lord and master endowed with knowledge, power, valour and radiance, and *Prakīti* as the *Vistārakshetra* of his wish. The attributes such as Father, mother, brother etc are various forms related to *guṇa, kriyā* and *Upāsana*.

The same almighty who causes creation, sustenance and dissolution, obtains the symbols of *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Rudra.*

> सृष्टिस्थित्यन्तकरणीम् ब्रह्मविष्णुशिवात्मिकाम्  
> स संज्ञां याति भगवानेक एव जनार्दनः 

**Each of them has his own prominence in each field. Same is the case with *Sarasvatī, Lakshmī* and *Gaurī*, the wives of the trinity, who cooperate with them.**

***Mahāguru Śrīraṅga*** used to explain it this way.—“Suppose, the same actor plays three roles in a drama. In the different acts of the play, different roles become more prominent. Those who happen to witness the acts of the same play separately, think that only a particular god of a particular act as prominent. The same is the case with the consorts of divinity. The same *parāprakṛti* plays the roles of *Vaṇi*, *Ramā* and *Gaurī*. Each one of her roles has special importance in a particular act of the play. When seen in the origin in the suprasensory realm, all of them are nothing but *paramapurusha* and *parāprakṛti* only. Descending just from the realm of that centre, the trinity in *dhyānamudra* and their consorts are seen. Again descending a little from that, in that suprasensory field only, the various forms of the trinity and their consorts, their glories, and their actions pertaining to the three *guṇas* are seen. Among the trinity, *Brahma* with his consort, *Mahavishṇu* with his consort and *Rudra* with his consort are the presiding deities for *Rajoguṇa*, *Sattvaguṇa* and *Tamoguṇa* respectively. Even though they are engaged in the activities related to the three *guṇas* they are *triguṇatītas*. Does it mean that *Brahma* and *Rudra* lack *Sattvaguṇa*? No. They have all the three in them, the-*Sattva, Rajas* and *Tamas*. Demons worship only the *rājasa* part, and those who have divine dispositions, worship the *sāttvika* \(part\). But, among the three or them, the one who works most in the realm of a particular *guṇa*, is \(generally\) called the presiding deity of that part. But, all the three *mūrtīs* have the same true form and their consorts also have the same true form. And that is why we find the names of *Gaurī* and *Sarasvatī* in *Lakshmī Sahasranāma,* the names of *Sarasvatī* and *Lakshmī* in *Lalitā Sahasranāma* the names of *Śiva* in *Vishṇu Sahasranāma*, and some names of *Vishṇu* in *Śiva Sahasranāma.* When viewed in the above said manner, the references like *Lakshmī*, *Sarasvatī* and *Gaurī* as mother, daughter, grand-daughter and daughter-in-law fit at different \(spiritual\) centres.

Among the two groups viz the trinity and their divine consorts, which group has more prominence? The answer is, both the groups are equally prominent. The first group belongs to the *purusha* and the second group to *prakṛti*. Whom should the *prakṛti* nurture? It should nurture the lustre of the *purusha*. So, the importance to *purusha*. But the *prakṛti* is very essential for the growth of the strength of *purusha*. Therefore, importance to *purusha* in the aspect of growing and importance to *prakṛti* in nurturing that growth. As the trinity has to work with the help of their consorts, we may say metaphorically that they are the sons and servants of the *parāŚakti*.

For example, when *Gaurī* combines with *Śiva* and is engaged in the activity of *laya*, we call her as the consort of *Śiva*. Both the *purusha* and *prakṛti* appear here as expansions of *paramapurusha* and *parāprakṛti.* But, if creation and other activities have not begun by their coming together, *prakṛti* may be called as the sister of *purusha* in that state. Only in this sense the *Vedas* have called *ambikā* as *rudra’s* sister. In this sense only they are referred to as brother and sister before coming together and start working. Later they are husband and wife. Poetical compositions call a wife by many names; a servant when she noursihes her husband and a minister when she gives counsel to her husband.

“गृहिणी, सचिवः, सखी मिथः, प्रियशिष्या ललिते कलाविधौ।” 

In this sense *Gaurī* can be *Siva’s* consort and sister as well.

But how can *Gaurī* be the sister of *Nārāyaṇa*? Some argue as follows:—“This is because *Gaurī* is the left half portion of the body of *Siva. Nārāyaṇa* also adorns the left half of the body of *Sadāśiva*. And so, the *śāstras* state that *Vishṇu* and *Gaurī* were brother and sister, and *Gaurī* is the younger sister of *Vishṇu”*. But this is not correct. There is no scriptural evidence to this. And, we do not get here the answer to the question as to why *Gaurī* can only be the younger sister of *Vishṇu* and not the elder sister.

We get the correct answer in the tenth *skandha* of *Śrīmadbhāgavata*. *Śaktidevī* became the younger sister of *Vishṇu* in the *Kṛshṇāvatāra*. *Śrīkṛshṇa* tells *yogamāya* there—“I will take a partial incarnation in the womb of *Devakī* as her son. Following that, you take birth as the daughter of *Yashoda* in her womb. Let people call you by the names *Durgā*, *Bhadrakālī*, *Vijayā*, *Vaishṇavī*, *Kṛshṇā*, *Mādhavī, Īśānī, Ambikā* etc, and worship you with *dhūpa, upahāra* and *bali”*. And, we see that she takes birth accordingly. So, as she was born thus after *Kṛshṇa*, it is appropriate that she is called the younger sister of *Vishṇu*.” This is the scriptural description.

Thus, when viewed with discernment, it becomes very appropriate to call *Gaurī* variously with relation-names such as wife of *Śiva,* sister of *Śiva*, younger sister of *Nārāyaṇa*, owner or servant of *Lakshmī, Sarasvatī*, mother or daughter-in-law etc. Here there can be no room for aspects like wordly ethics, immorality, evolution of civilization etc.

***Bhagavān* is *Nirañjana* and *Jaganmāta* is *citprakṛti*. Even though they expand for the sake of *lokavyāpāra*, there can be no *vikāra* in their form. Here *Śrīraṇgamahāguru* had given the following analogy. “Even though a number of rāgas may spring from the same *Śṛuti* the *Śṛuti* does not undergo any change.” Therefore there can be no diminishing in the true forms of *Bhagavān* \(and\) *Bhagavati* by their involvement in the acts of creation etc.**

Thus *Gaurī* is referred to by various names such as *Śiva’s* wife, sister of *Śiva* the supreme god, sister of *Sarasijanābha* \(*Vishṇu*\), younger sister of *Nārāyaṇa* etc, and the festival pertaining to her, viz. *Svarṇagaurī vrata* is called commonly *Gaurīhabba*. When should it be celebrated? What should be the modalities? These shall be discussed now.

### When should it be celebrated?

This festival should be celebrated on the 3rd day of the *śuklapaksha* of *bhādrapada māsa*. \(*Tṛtīyā tithi* should be there at the time of sunrise on that day. It will be very endearing to *Gaurī* if the *caturthī tithi* fixed for the worship of *Gaṇeśa* happens to be touching *tṛtīyā*. Therefore, *Gaurī* festival should be celebrated on the day when the *yoga* of *caturthī* occurs with *tṛtīyā*. Suppose *tṛtīyā* spreads for most part of the previous day, or for that whole day \(for a full sixty *Ghaṭikas*\), and it lasts for just the duration of one *muhūrta* or even less the next day Then, when should the festival be celebrated? It should be observed only on the following day.

मुहूर्तमात्रा ततो न्यूनापि परा ग्राह्या, पूर्वदिने  
> षष्टिघटीमितामपि त्यक्त्वा परदिने अल्पापि  
> चतुर्थीयुतैव ग्राह्या गणयोग प्राशस्तात् 

### How should it be observed?

Goddess *Gaurīdevi* should be meditated upon in the heart and then worshipped externally. What should be the medium for external worship? A golden idol of *Gaurīdevi*, or a pot, or turmeric, or sand or clay collected from a pure river or a lake—in all these or in any one or two or three of these, *Devī* is invoked and worshipped. What should one do if he or she cannot afford to get an idol made of gold? “Such people may get it done in silver, which is less expensive. Such a custom is also followed by some”-some say, But it is not correct. *Kalpas* do not merely insist that the idol should be made of gold for the reason that gold is expensive. Scriptures prescribe that the idol should be made of gold because of the extraordinary property of the substance. If one cannot afford to get \(it made of\) gold he should use another material of equal merit or one with a little less merit in its place. That material is *‘haridrā’* \(turmeric\). It is not merely because that turmeric also possesses the color of gold. **Whatever the \(change in the\) state occurs in the body that helps to obtain the grace of the deity by seeing or touching gold, is accomplished on seeing or touching turmeric also. This has been demonstrated by *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* by *Nāḍīśāstra***. Even if the idol is made of clay, it should be painted with golden color only. The goddess who is worshipped is *Gaurī* the yellow complexioned. She is described as “चाम्पेयगौरार्धशरीरकायै कर्पूरगौरार्धशरीरकाय” by *Śrīśaṅkarabhagavatpāda*, as one with an auspicious form glowing with the colour of the *Campaka* flower.

Those who desire to worship the goddess by invoking her in sand or clay should purify themselves by taking a bath etc on the morning of the festival, and go to a river or a lake and worship *Gaṅgā* there. Then taking the pure sand or clay from the river or the lake and placing it in a cloth applied with turmeric, they tie a knot, and offer *Shoḍaśopacāra pūja* to it, and bring it to the temple or home, accompanied by auspicious instrumental music. Then they place it in a *manṭapa* and offer worship after doing *prāṇa pratishṭā* to it. *Devī* should be worshipped as per precepts, three times or twice a day, till she is given a send off. This part of the festival may be done by men, who are rendered pure by rituals and who are knowledgeable in modalities. Afterwards women do the worship. Those who cannot afford to install *Gaurī* for worship in their houses, go either to others’ houses or a temple where *Gaurī* has been installed, and offer their worship there. The *kaṅkaṇa* which is a part of this observance should have sixteen knots in it.

*Pūja* begins with *ghanṭānāda*. Then follows *Ācamana, saṅkalpa, kalaśa pūja* and *mahāgaṇapati pūja*; and then the idol of *SvarṇaGaurī* is installed and *devī* is meditated upon.

> हरान्वितामिन्दुमुखीं सर्वाभरणभूषिताम् ।  
> विमलाङ्गीं विशालाक्षीं चिन्तयामि सतीं शिवाम् ॥ 

\(I meditate upon *Satīdevī* the consort of *Śiva*, who is together with *Śiva*, glowing with all the ornaments, endowed with pure limbs and shining with large eyes\).

She should be invoked with flowers and *Akshatā*, and then should be offered the jewel throne. A new thread has to be kept for *pūja* and *dhāraṇa* \(worshipping and wearing\). Then, \(services\) such as *Pādya, Arghya, Ācamana, Madhuparka Pancāmṛtasnāna Śuddhodhakasnāna, vastras, Ābharaṇa* \(jewels\), yajnopavīta, *gandha, akshata*, turmeric and *kuṅkuma* and other auspicious things and fragrant flowers should be offered. Then, *aṅgapūja, pushpapūja, patrapūja* and *nāmapūja* should be offered. After that, all the sixteen knots of the thread should be worshipped with the sixteen names viz., *SvarṇaGaurī, MahāGaurī, Kātyāyinī, Kaumārī, Bhadhrā, Vishṇusodarī, Maṅgala Devatā, Rākenduvadanā, Candraśekharapriyā, Vishveshvarapatnī, Dākshāyaṇi, Kṛshṇaveṇī, Bhavānī, lolekshanā, Menakātmajā,* and *SvarṇaGaurī*.

*Devi* should be worshipped with *ashṭottara divyanāmas* and *Dhūpa, dīpa, naivedya, tāmbūla, phala, dakshiṇā, arghya, nīrājana, Pushpāñjali* \(offering flowers from cupped hands held together\) and *pradakshiṇa* and *namaskāra* should be offered. The special *naivedya* to be offered to *Devī* is *haridrānna* \(yellow coloured cooked rice,\) and *mudgānna* \(sacred food prepared with green gram and yellow coloured rice\)

Then *Devi* should be prayed for the fulfillment of desires and prosperity, and with her permission, the sixteen knotted threads mentioned above should be worn. She should be prayed to bestow with sons, wealth, prosperity and all the desires in the parameters of *Dharma*.

For the completion of the observance of the *vrata, pakvānna* and other gifts should be offered to great *Brāhmins* and *sumaṅgalis* \(and *Brāhmin* couples also\). Services such as *chatra, cāmara, nṛtya, vādya, Āndolikā* should be offered to *Devī*, and her affection and grace should to be sought.

Though there may be some differences in the modalities of the *pūja*, offering of services that are dear to *Devī* will be in all of them. The offering of vedic and tantric *mantraślokas*, and also the offering of *Tantras* will be there. The custom of listening to stories pertaining to the *vrata* after the worship is also in vogue.

This *vrata* may be observed by both men and women. Those who desire to perform *udyāpana* of the *vrata*, should clean the eastern part of the house, erect a *manṭapa*, spread cereals and install a copper *kalaśa* with the figure of a lotus having sixteen petals etched on it. Then the divine couple is invoked in the golden idols of *Pārvatī* and *Parameśvara,* and are offered *abhisheka* with *pañcagavya* and *pañcāmṛtha*.Then the idols are placed on the *Kalaśa* and *Prāṇapratishṭa* is done, and *Shoḍaśopacāra pūjas* are performed. The performer of these worships should keep awake thoughout that night.

On the following morning, after bath and *Ahnika*, the *parādevatās* should be worshipped again. *Homa* should be performed with gingelly, *yava* and *Ājya*, to the chanting of *saṅkarshaṅa mantra* and *Gaurīmantra*. Again, *Devi* should be worshipped and the gifting of cow and bronze vessels along with *Dakshiṇa* to the *Ācārya* should be done. Sixteen *Brāhmins* and *Suvāsinis* should be fed, offered gifts and their blessings should be received. After that, *Prasāda* should be had along with relatives and friends.

Those who cannot afford to perform the *vrata*, should do *Devipūja* to the extent possible, and give *dāna* and *dakshiṇa* etc in keeping with their ability, to the deserving ones and make the day holy by singing the praises etc of Devī.

Question 1-There is a custom of bringing clay from *gaṅgā* for making the idol of *Gaurī devī* or the sacred sand. If river *gaṅgā* is not close by, *gaṅgā* is invoked in a nearby pond or lake, and sand and clay are brought from there. What is the reason for this custom? If clay and sand are available nearby, why not make use of them? Why one has to go to *gaṅgā tīrtha*? This is the first question. The answer lies in the *tāttvika rūpa* of *gaṅgā* and *Gaurī*.

The *purāṇas* and *Itihasas* say that both *gaṅgā* and *Gaurī* are daughters of *Himavān*, the emperor of mountains.

> तस्यां गङ्गा समभवत् ज्येष्ठा हिमवतः सुता ।  
> उमा नाम द्वितीयाभूत् कन्या तस्यैव राघव ॥  
> एते ते शैलराजस्य सुते लोकनमस्कृते ।  
> गङ्गा च सरितां श्रेष्ठा उमा देवी च राघव ॥ \(रामायण, बालकाण्ड-सर्ग 35\) 

We have to take note of the general and special meanings and the purport of these statements. Why *Gaṅgā* is called the daughter of *Himavān*? One may easily say “Don’t you know even this much”? River *gaṅgā* takes its birth in the Himālayan Mountains. Therefore *purāṇas* metaphorically say that *gaṅgā* is the daughter of *himavān*. “But, the scriptures call the very same *gaṅgā* as the one born of the feet of *Nārāyaṇa”* \(विष्णुपादोद्भवा गङ्गा\), “holy water in the *kamanḍalu* of *Brahmadeva”* \(आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलम्\), daughter of sage *Jahnu*, \(जाह्नवी सुरनिम्नगा\), and “Daughter of *Bhagīratha”* \(*bhāgīrathī*\). One way is to interpret from the view point of each story. For example, some explanations may be had from the statements viz. “Lord *Brahmadeva* washed the feet of *Nārāyaṇa* who was in the form of *trivikrama,* with the holy water of his *kamanḍalu; Jahnumaharshi* drank up *gaṅgā* completely and then let her out through his right ear; *gaṅgā* incarnated on the earth and followed *Bhagīratha*, as a result of the severe penance done by him. And so, *gaṅgā* is called by the above names”. But when we study the *pāramārthika bhāva* of *gaṅgā*, an explanation which is well woven and uniform can be obtained.

Philosophically speaking, *gaṅgā* is in indeed a flow of pure divine knowledge. It is in fact, a \(continuous flow\) of *brahma vidya*. The origin of that flow of knowledge is the very abode of god. It flows down from there for the welfare of the world. *Himavān* too, with a summit that grants supreme bliss, is vast, steady and a meditational abode of *yogis*, is indeed a representative of the supreme soul. It is praised by vedic hymns as “ब्रह्मण आपी स्थः” \(you are the nails for the *Ālambana* of *Brahma*\), as it comes from the right ear of a *Brhmajnāni* via the *vedavidyās*. And *Bhagīratha* is a *Mahāyogi* who obtained that great flow of knowledge by the power of penance, and utilized it for the world. All these proclaim a single philosophy—That *gaṅgā* is a flow of divine knowledge \(*jnāna pravāha*\). We may recall here that the scriptures call the holy water of *gaṅgā* as ‘the water body form of *Śiva* who is *jnāna-sukhasvarūpi* “\(शम्भोर्जलमयी मूर्तिः\)”. *Śrīśaṅkarabhagavatpāda* also proclaims the same philosophy that *jnāna-gaṅgā* is the mother of the three worlds and is all pervading” “त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा”. The commentaries on *kenopanishat* and *taittarīya upanishat* proclaim—“As *gaṅgā* is a continuous flow the divine knowledge, *Gaurī devi* is also a true form of *Brahma Vidya”*.

> यक्षे भक्तिं बुद्धवा विद्या उमारूपिणी प्रादुरभूत् ।  
> सर्वेषां हि शोभमानानां शोभनतमा विद्या ॥ \(शङ्करभाष्य\)  
> परशक्तिरूपेण स्थिता प्रणवपर्यायेण उमाशब्देन उच्यते ॥ -भट्टभास्कर भाष्य 

Thus, *Gaṅgā* and *Gaurī* are the very modes of *Brahma Vidyā*. The essence of both is *jnāna* only. Therefore *śāstras* state that they are sisters. The abode of *Gaṅgā* is the abode of *Gaurī* also. In order to expound this philosophical knowledge, the tradition of worshipping *Gauri* through the holy sand or clay of *Gaṅgā* is quite appropriate.

Question 2-We see a very deep relationship between the number sixteen and the modalities of the worship of *Gaurī*. The *aṅgapūja* of *Gaurī* is done in sixteen places. The number of flowers and leaves used in the worship is sixteen. The number of knots on the *dora* is sixteen. The number of years required for the fulfillment of *Gaurī vrata* is sixteen.

> षोडशान्वत्सरान्. . . पूजयेद्भकिपूर्वकम् ।  
> एवं कृत्वा नरः पार्थ परिपूर्णव्रती भवेत् ॥ 

The number of priests who officiate for the completion of this \(*udyāpana*\) is sixteen. *Vāyana Dāna* is for sixteen people and the number of couples to be worshipped is sixteen.

> षोडशप्रमितं दद्यात् ब्राह्मणेभ्यश्च वायनम् ।  
> ऋत्विजः षोडशाप्येवं पक्वान्नैः प्रीणयेत्सदा ॥ 

Is the occurrence of this number sixteen in *Gaurīpūja* a more coincidence or is there any special reason? This is the second question.

We are of the opinion that the number sixteen here is for a special reason. The philosophy that Mother Nature who is endowed sixteen *kalās* and who is *paramātmamayī* is *Gaurī devī* herself, is indicated here. The first among these sixteen *kalās* is nothing but the *śuddha caithanyamaya Śivasvarūpa*. The *paraprakṛti* itself is *Gaurī devī* who expands that *Śiva svarūpa*. For people like us who are immersed in inert nature, it is extremely difficult to directly touch that pure spirit. So, the compassionate mother *Gaurī* joins that *caitanya Kāla* with fifteen *kalas*, gets magnified and expanded to us. When we worship her, the sixteen *kalās* of our inert nature get purified and assume the form of *parāprakṛti*; and find refuge in the *paramātma svarūpa* and attain frution. She is neither just a *Caitanya Kalā* nor a *jadaprakṛti* consisting of fifteen *kālas,* but she is the *Mahādevi* who is endowed with fifteen *Kalās* which get refined by the *caitanya kalā* and thus complete with the sixteen *kalās*, acting as a bridge between us and the *paramatma*. This is the significance of the number sixteen proclaimed in *Gaurīpūja*.

Question 3: Why should the idol of *Gaurī* which is made with devotion and installed with *prāṇa pratishṭhā* be given a send off? This is another question. Why can’t we continue worshipping it daily? Why should we bid good bye to the sacred idol?

In reply to the above, the following points have to be noted. It is difficult to perform the worship every day, maintaining ritualistic purity and as per precepts. For this reason, doing *udvāsana* after worshipping for a stiupulated time has been a custom in deity worship. Even in the daily ritual of *sandhyāvandana*, we see that *Gāyatrī devī* is invoked, and after the *japa, upasthāna* is done. Bidding good bye is a sacred ritual. It is not done with the intention of abandoning her by sending away. It is an auspicious rite performed with the intention that after reaching her sacred abode, may She joyfully arrive again when we invoke her for worship. This is an auspicious send—off for that goddess performed with the feeling “शोभनार्थं पुनरागमनाय च”. *Udvāsana* is thus a temporary send off along with auspicious *manodharma* and materials, only to invite her again. That is why while sending *Gaurī*, five kinds of rice items viz jaggery rice, ghee rice, curd rice, tamarind rice, *pāyasa* and *paramanna* are offered. And goddess is given a send off with auspicious things viz-bangles, *Biccole*, turmeric, *kuṅkuma*, *Shobhana tandula* \(rice filled in the pouch made from the front part of a sari\), clothes, mirror and comb etc. to the tune of auspicious sounds of musical instruments. This is a *śobhana yātra*. The intention that *devī* who has returned to her *maṅgaladhama* may \(arrive\) again at the time of worship, is hidden here. Why should the idol of *devī* be sent off in water only ? This matter will be described in the chapter of the worship of *Gaṇeśa*. \(The idol of *Gaṇeśa* is also immersed in water only, as per precepts\). We should note that the send off also happens to be a part of the services and worship.

Thus, *Gaurīpūja* which begins with *Dhyāna* and *Āvāhana* ends auspiciously with *Udvāsana*. We pray to the all auspicious *Gaurīdevi* known as *Sarvamaṅgalā*, for the auspiciousness \(benediction of one and all\).





	 
## Hanumajjayantī

*Hanumajjayantī* is an important festival celebrated in the month of *Caitra*, after *ŚrīRāmanavami*. The deity worshipped on that day is *Hanumān*. He is a *mahātma*, famously known by names such as *Āñjaneya*, *Māruti*, *Prāṇadevaru*, *Tiruvadi*, *Mahāvīra* etc, in the literature of *jnānis* and devotees. It is but natural that, after the worship of *Śrī Rāma* on *Rāmanavami* and on a day very close to *Śrī Rāmanavami*, the custom of worshipping this God who is the greatest among the retinue of *ŚrīRāma*, who is dear to devotees, dear to scholars and who is very popular, continues even to this day. Not just in the *Rāmāyaṇa*, *Mahābhārata*, *Purāṇas*, *Dharmaśāstras* and musical and poetic compositions, even in folk literature and sayings such as

*‘Rāmana banṭa Hanumanta Tirupatiyembude Vaikunṭha’*

		
\(*Rāma’s* slave is *Hanumanta*, *Tirupati* is *Vaikunṭha* \(Abode of *Vishṇu*\)

*‘Hanumanillada haḷḷiye? Gaṇapanillada grāmave?’*

\(Can there be a village without *Hanumān* or *Gaṇapa?*\),

and also his splendid images in various postures, his pictures and temples and towers, show the influence he has cast on the minds of our people. Only those devotees who worship *Hanumān* as the principal deity, celebrate this festival in a special way. Even then, we consider this an important festival and shall discuss it, as this is a festival of that God who is adored in all parts of the country, and who is omnipresent.

When we begin to discuss about this festival we are faced with hundreds of questions pertaining to *Hanumān*, the reigning deity of this festival. Is *Hanumān* just a fiction? Or a real object? Is he an historical person? Or a great power? Is he a God worthy of worship? etc. This is because, though the custom of worshipping him with great faith and devotion is prevailing from centuries, we have been hearing of late, many arguments which are aiming at slackening the very root of such beliefs. So let us examine some important opinions expressed by scholars regarding this.

1. One argument is as follows. “The imagination of a shadow ghost which was causing fear in the forest dwellers of the *Vindhya* mountains took the shape of *Hanumān*. He is basically a god of the wild people. During the time of the merging of cultures and civilizations of *Ārya* and *Anārya* clans, he was included in the category of Hindu deities” -

2. “*Hanumān* is a symbol of a fiction but not of a fiction of a very high order. He is the symbol of slavery which arose during the conflict between *Ārya* and *Drāviḍa* races in India, when the *drāviḍa* leaders joined hands with the *Āryan* king betraying their own people.” Some also say that he stands for a symbol, which begets no respect from men who love freedom.

3. There is a view that he is just an apeman animal.

4. “*Hanumān* is not a product of imagination. He is a historical person. He is not a monkey as ordinary people surmise. He was a leader of a forest dwelling group whose logo was a monkey. He, like his master *ŚrīRāma*, came to be included in the class of gods in course of time”—is the opinion of some.

5. Some even praise him thus - “He is not a mere leader of the clan of the forest people. He is a leader of the civilized people. And that too, he is bright man of the *kannada* country and a *kannadiga* warrior.”

6. According to *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* the ancient most work which introduces *Hanumān* to us, he was a leader of the *vānaras*, was both a wise and a well-wisher minister of monkey king *Sugrīva* who was the ruler of *Kishkindhā*. He was born to *Añjanādevi*, wife of *Vānara* chief *Kesari*, from the power of *Vāyudeva*.

> तस्य भार्या बभूवैषा ह्यञ्जनेति परिश्रुता ।  
> जनयामास तस्यां वै वायुरात्मजमुत्तमम् ॥ \(सुन्दर 34-41\) 

He was the foremost among the bold and the heroic, ready witted and a statesman.

> पौरुषं विक्रमो बुद्धिः यस्मिन्नेतानि नित्यदा ॥ \(युद्ध 128-78\)

> त्वय्येव हनुमन्नस्ति बलं बुद्धिः पराक्रमः ।  
> देशकालानुवृत्तिश्च नयश्च नयपण्डित ॥ \(किष्किन्धा 44-7\) 

He is the foremost among those who have conquered their senses. न तु मे मनसा किञ्चित् वैकृत्यमुपपद्यते” \(सुन्दर 11-40\)

All his great deeds, such as crossing the ocean, searching for *Sītādevi*, vanquishing of the *rākshasas*, burning of *Lankā* and carrying the mountain etc. are thrilling adventures. He was endowed with the extraordinary boons given by important *devas* such as Lord *Brahma* and others. In spite of all these, he was unusually humble and the best servant of *Rāma* who took great pride in calling himself a slave of *Śrī Rāmacandra*.

Though he possesses the form and nature of a *Vānara*, he is, in fact the son of a god, endowed with supernatural faculties and a *Kāmarūpi* \(one who can assume any form at pleasure\)

7. The *Mahābhārata* too, a gem of an *itihāsa*, supports the very same ideas the *Rāmāyaṇa* states on *Māruti*, and makes a reference to the great favour rendered by him to *Bhīma* and *Arjuna*.

> यदा सिह्मरवं वीर करिष्यसि महाबल ।  
> तदाहं बृंहयिष्यामि स्वरवेण परन्तप ॥  
> विजयस्य ध्वजस्थश्च नादान्योक्ष्यामि दारुणान्” \(म. भा. वन 151-16\) 

8. *ŚrīmadbhāgavataPurāṇa* refers to him as a *Paramabhāgavata* \(devotee of the highest order\) who is constantly absorbed in worshipping *ŚrīRāma* and *Sīta* in the *Kimpurusha* mountain.

किम्पुरुषे वर्षे भगवन्तमादिपुरुषं लक्ष्मणाग्रजम् ।  
> सीताभिरामं रामं तच्चरणसन्निकर्षाभिरतः ।  
> परमभागवतो हनुमान् सह किम्पुरुषैरविरतभकिरुपास्ते \(भाग 5-19-1\) 

9. The *Śivapurāṇa* also praises the divine greatness of *Māruti* declaring him an incarnation of Lord *Rudra*.

“रुद्रावतारो भगवान् भक्तोद्धारकरस्स वै”  
> “सर्वसैन्यं ररक्षासौ महादेवात्मजः कपिः”  
> “मातुराज्ञामनुप्राप्य रुद्रांशः कपिसत्तमः” \(शतरुद्रसंहिता अ. 20\) 

The rest of the *Purāṇas* also refer to him as an incarnation with a divine element, brave, heroic, wise, long lived, a *Mahāyogi* and the heir apparent to the position of the next *Brahma*.

10. Upholding the opinion expressed by the great religious works referred to above, our tradition has also been worshipping him as god.

In tune with the saying “हनुमान् दास्ये च सख्येऽर्जुनः”, \(our tradition\) worships him as a bright example of *Bhakti* of the slave form. Once Lord *Śrī Hari* came to him in the guise of *Śrī Kṛshṇa* to give him *darsan*. Then that great devotee implored the Lord. “Lord, I want you to assume the form of *Śrī Rāma*, your *Rukminī* should take the form of *Sītā*. You have to have the bow *Kodanḍa* instead of the flute and only then I shall prostrate before you.” This is a delectable story. Devotees place a separate *maṇe* \(a low wooden seat, called as *Hanumān’s* seat\) while doing the *Pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa*, with the sentimental feeling that he stays in such places with folded hands, enjoying the divine bliss \(of listening to the story of *Śrī Rāma*\). We come across many devotional stories which say that he keeps himself present in a disguised form in the assembly where *Rāma’s* story is narrated, and blesses the devotees who recognize him. Devotees pray Lord *Māruti* for benefits such as cessation of bad dreams, removal of afflictions from evil spirits, victory in wars, health, eloquence and unstinted to devotion to *ŚrīRāma* etc.

Weighing all these opinions on the balance of judgment, we can have a comprehension of he matter as follows:-

		
There is no scientific evidence to the opinions that he was a devil in the *Vindhya* forests, or a monkeyman, or a human being with the symbol of a monkey. These opinions are a stuff of pure conjecture based on the colour of the skin and the physique of people \(of some regions like *Vindhya* etc.\), and also they are nothing but fictitious imaginations emerging from verbal jugglery. The very same weak evidence is advanced to state that Dravidians are none other than *Dasyus* stated in the *vedas* and the Āryans attacked their land and culture, and ultimately both the cultures merged. Our own *Arthaśāstra* \(the science of polity\) and history tell us that *Dasyus* are those who cause destruction of materials and religious wealth and *Kshatrīyas* are appointed to punish them and to protect the bridge of *Dharma*. This opinion is one which is natural, simple and pleasing. Such *dasyus* may exist in any society at any time in any country. Without taking note of this spirit, religious fanatics from other countries indulge in branding *Dasyus* as a race, and the conflict between them and another race itself is history of ancient India. Authentic evidences are available to show that this has been done by many \(vested interests\) to sow the seeds of enmity in the minds of people belonging to different provinces in our country. We shall mention these aspects when we take up for discussion, the great festival of *Śivarātri*.

For now, we wish to state that tradition can be taken as an authority, as there are no contradicting evidences. We need not accept all clever stories and popular legends as authoritative. But we also need not reject the tradition and beliefs \(opinions\) in aspects where no contradictions exist.

Can a *Vānara* conduct himself like a human being? It is possible for such a being to have divine powers?-These questions are satisfactorily answered in the first ever epic itself \(ie. the *Rāmāyaṇa*\). It proclaims him as no ordinary *Vānara*, but a divine being who took birth to assist *Vishṇu* who incarnated in the form of *ŚrīRāma*. Nothing is impossible as deities have divine powers. Aspects such as *avatāra* and its meaning, the necessity of an *avatāra* to God and whether such a thing is possible have been dealt with in the discussion of *Śrī Rāmanavami*. When viewed in this perspective, there will be no need to conceptualise *Hanumān* as a monkeyman or a person with the logo of an ape. Now the question whether *Hanumān* is a historical character or a figment of imagination. The *Śāstras* categorically say that he is a form of *prāṇatattva*. We wish to ask whether *praṇatattva* is a mere imagination or a reality. If the reply is that it is only an imagination, we can only say that there is no *prāṇa* for both, i.e. the person who puts this question and the one who answers that. \(Here *Prāṇa* word is used in the colloquial sense that there is no strength or paver either in the questioner or answerer\)

*Hanumān* is not a historic person in the ordinary sense such as a person bearing that name took birth in a certain year, did not exist before that year and died in some year etc. He is a form of *praṇatattva* which existed in the past, continues to exist now and forever, and, that power might have manifested in the physical world in the form of *Hanumān* once in the past, and may do so from time to time also. But we have to understand the fact that it is eternal in the form of a principle.

We see *Māruti* in the posture of folded hands in some idols and pictures. Seeing this some have gone to the extent of saying thus - “He is a symbol of slavery. He cannot be an ideal for freedom loving people like us. So we should never worship him.” But we wish to say that such an utterance is only a rave of rage and not a statement borne out of experience, and also not a wise instruction. This can be analysed as follows:—

Everyone in this world is a slave. Some are slaves of sense organs. Some are slaves of the mind and the intellect. Some others are slaves of all these. They see only what the *jnānendriyas*, \(viz. the eyes, the ear, the nose, the skin and the tongue\), the *Karmendriyas*, \(viz. the speech, the hands, the feet, the anus and the procreating organ\), the mind, and the intellect show them. They dance, jump and somersault to the tune of these \(senses\). They work overtime to supply whatever these senses desire for. Those who claim “We stand on our own legs. We act according to our own light \(wisdom\)”, also fall under this category. But our *Hanumān* is a slave of *ŚrīRāma* who is an embodiment of *Satya*, *Jnāna* and *ānanda* and who is an *ĀtmāRāma*. Among these two kinds of slaves, the ones belonging to the first kind reap exhaustion, momentary happiness, little happiness and happiness mixed with misery, as a price for the hard work done and slavery, \(of the senses\), whereas *Hanumān*, who belongs to the second category, and who observes servitude out of pure love, reaps pure happiness, permanent happiness, peace, bliss, prosperity and immortality. So, when slavery becomes inevitable, the wise should decide for themselves, the one which is ideal and acceptable among the two categories.

Some people say that he is a great historical person and not an imaginary character. The question whether he is a principle or a historical person has been touched upon already.

In reality, he is a form of *prāṇatattva*. It is not impossible that this *prāṇatattva* has manifested at times in history. When such a manifestation occurs, and if \(such marks\) appear in literature, sculpture and edicts \(inscriptions\) to suggest the special appearance in a certain part of the world, people say that he belongs to that particular region. In this sense *Hanumān* might have illuminated a region which is now called *Karṇāṭaka*. People of that region may take pride in that. But great men just do not belong to one country or race. There is no harm in nurturing this pride along with the discernment that great persons do not just belong to a certain country but belong to the entire universe. Just as *ŚrīRāmacandra* of *Ayodhyā* of northern India, the *Āñjaneya* of *Kishkindhā* from southern India belongs to the entire universe by his preeminence.

Thus, even if *Śrī Rāma* and *Hanumān* were indeed \(great\) preeminent historical persons who lived and went back to their place long time ago, they are still venerable. When their memory appears to our minds through literature, sculpture, pictures etc. it inspires us to follow the good deeds shown by them by their actual life. But *Śrī Rāma* and *Hanumān*, described vividly by *jnānis*, are not just historical persons who lived for some time and disappeared. They are images for both external and internal meditations and worship. A place called *Daharāyodhyā* near *Nandigrāma* is renowned as the birthplace of *ŚrīRāma*. And *Hanumān* is the *prāṇa mūrtī* who has *nityayoga* with *Ātmārāma* there. Practically speaking, *Hanumān* hails from *Kishkindhā* of south India. And for his ordinary dwelling, Lord *Rāma* has bestowed upon him the region called *Kimpurushavarsha*, which is located between the two eyebrows being the central spot of the meditational area of the *yogis*. The vivid depiction of *ŚrīRāma* and *Hanumān* displaying oneness with regard to both the inner principles and history of the outside world provided by the *jnānis*, is not to create any confusion in the minds. It is for the sake of bliss of both the realms, which can be experienced by making the inner culture blossom in the external civilization and making the external civilization merge in the inner culture. It will be our own fault if we misuse the contribution of the sages for nurturing doubts and for restlessness, while in actuality, they are intended to clear the doubts and bestow bliss.

The argument that *Hanumān* was respected in the beginning as a great person and later he was attributed with divinity, and the other argument that *ŚrīRāma* was considered an ideal personage and later was elevated as God, belong to the same category. Of these two, the second argument has been answered in the discussion of the *Rāmanavami festival*. This answer itself can provide the reply for the objection that *Hanumān* was attributed with Godhood later.

*Hanumān* is one of the *cirañjīvis* such as emperor *Bali*, great sage *Vyāsa* and others.

अश्वत्थामा बलिर्व्यासः हनूमांश्च विभीषणः ।  
> कृपः परशुरामश्च सप्तैते चिरजीविनः ॥ 

is a famous *śloka*. The question arises as to what does the word “*Cirañjīvi*” mean? Ordinary people think that they are immortal and live forever with no destruction of the body. But the actual meaning of that word is that the one who lives for a very long time. The word does not mean that he is the one who lives forever. The *Cirañjīvis* are those who live for a very long time compared to ordinary human beings. The duration of the long life of *Hanumān* is the present *Brahma Kalpa*. Can anyone live with his physical body for such a long time which can be calculated only arithmetically? The answer is, it is not possible for all. But it is possible in some special situations for some distinguished persons. It is possible \(for such persons\) to create for themselves a body out of the subtle principles after crossing some layers of time, either by their power of penance of by the special will of God. For instance, it is well known that things kept in the cold environs of the poles remain without any change even after a very long time. Similarly things kept in a refrigerator do not get stale for a long time. Also, the substances which become stale in the ordinary climate, do not become so when they are given some treatment. For example, a substance kept in salt lasts longer without becoming stal. In the same way, it is possible for the body to remain \(in tact\) for a very long time, by the coordinations provided by nature itself, and also by the situations and special effects caused by penance.

Some may say - “O.K. It may become possible to live for such a long time. But does it not cause boredom?” Some \(others\) may reply “One may get disgusted in a life laden with \(the experiences of\) sufferings and penure. But why should one get disgusted, if his life is full \(of joy\) with wife, children and sensual objects? Our *Hanumān* has no such possessions and wealth. So, it should be boring to him \(to live a long life.” - Like this, the debate may continue. But the fact is, even if all the sensual enjoyments are at one’s disposal, he may get bored at least after some time. For this specific reason only, even though *Yamadharmarāja* promised *Naciketa* and said—“I will make you the owner of all \(pleasures\) and make the very pleasures themselves to seek you. \(कामानां त्वा कामभाजं करोमि\)”, the wise *Nachiketha* replies “No one likes to live for a long time” “अतिदीर्घे जीविते को रमेत?”. In the society, a person though possessed with all the sensual enjoyments, may feel tired with his long life, when he witnesses the sufferings of people in the society. And some *Dharmanishṭhas* on seeing the waxing of *Adharma* in this world may feel “I cannot bear witnessing this growth of unrighteousness. Neither am I capable of routing it. So this long life is like a curse.” So, any how, long life should be causing boredom, is n’t it? Then Why did *Hanumān* desire for that? The answer is, he did not get it by desiring for it. *Śrī Rāma* ordained long life to him, wanting him to remain as a pillar of \(HIS\) fame for a very long time on this earth.”

“जीविते कृतबुद्धिस्त्वं मा प्रतिज्ञां विलोपय । मत्कथाः प्रचरिष्यन्ति यावल्लोके हरीश्वर । तावद्रमस्व सुप्रीतो मद्वाक्यमनुपालयन्”

Would Lord *ŚrīRāma* who ordered *Hanumān* to remain in the physical world for a very long time, bestow that command to a person who does not have the ability to carry out that order? *Anjaneya* who was the foremost among the *jnānis* by the grace of *ŚrīRāma* had this capability. What he experienced was extraordinary divine bliss. A supreme divine bliss that never causes boredom. The *Ātmānanda*. And, a Supreme bliss. As evident by the words—

“सदा रामरामेति रामामृतं ते । सदा रामनामानन्दनिष्यन्दकन्दम् । पिबन्तं नमन्तं सुदन्तं हसन्तम् । हनूमन्तमन्तर्भजे तं नितान्तम्” he sees the whole world pervaded by *Rāma* and so, there can be no cause for boredom for him, who is always immersed in the bliss of *Rāmadhyāna*.

“ततो न विजुगुप्सते” It is sufficient to say that to *Hanumān*, who is the supreme among the *Siddhas*, the most magnificent among the servants of *Rāma* devoted to the execution of the work of his master, and a preeminent *jnāni* who always experiences the divine bliss, long life will not be a cause of disgust. This is the essence of his long life.

Some *śāstras* say that *Āñjaneya* is the son of *Prāṇadeva*. Also we come across references in some *śāstras* that state he was born from the *amśa* of *Rudra deva*. We see that his devotees praise him with the words *“Roma romagaḷalli Koti Koti shivalingagaḷa Udbhavavannu hondiruva Mahāmahima”* \(He is great soul with manifestation of crores and crores of *Śivaliṅgas* in the innumerable hairs of his body\) When such is the case, some may question.—“Which god’s *amśa* is he? Is he a strange offspring born to two fathers.?” We should not perceive the relationships of husband and wife and father and son of the deities and mysticisms associated with them, on par with similar relationships seen in the external world. There won’t be any room for misgivings if it taken in the sense which is *tattvasammata* \(i.e. agreeing principlewise\), that he is a manifested deity of great *mahimā* \(divine power\) endowed with the strength and nature of both the deities viz *prāṇa* and *Rudra*. Some may deride saying that he is a whoreson born to *Vāyu* in *Añjana* the wife of the monkey warrior *Kesarī*. “Why should the well born worship him?”—they may ask. Such people should take note of the abovesaid principle. In fact, all men and women are being touched by many deities who abound both inside the body and outside, and so, all creatures are nothing but misbegottens only. It should be construed that it is sheer mischief to compare an event which was effected because of an extraordinary divine grace, with wordly lecherousness. The impurities associated with the mind \(and body\) of human beings do not apply to divinities. Same rules should not be applied to both.

Some say cleverly - “In the *Ṛgveda*, God *Vāyu* is the friend of *Indra* \(*Indra* is also called *Hari*\). In course time, the preeminence of *Indra* faded and his prominence came to his younger brother *Upendra*, who is none other than *Vishṇu*. So *Vāyu* came to be honoured as a friend of *Vishṇu*. So, *Vāyu* and *Prāṇa* are different.” But *Vāyu* is the evolution of the \(life force\) *prāṇa* of the *paramapurusha”*. These critics should note the Ṛgvedic hymn “प्राणाद्वायुरजायत.” *Vāyu* is a friend *Indra* and he is both a friend and a servant of *Vishṇu*. They should take note of the statements of the *Srutis* also viz.

“वाताद्विष्णोर्बलमाहुः प्राणशरीरो भूरूपः”, “सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति”

*Paramātma* is the master life force and the spirit of even the *prāṇa*. And \(the fact\) that *Hanumān* a form of *Prāṇa* is the *śesha* of *HIM*, is quite in accordance with the vedic principles.

Scriptural evidences may be there to say that *Hanumān* is *Prāṇatattva*. They can be substantiated by reason also. But a question arises whether it is possible to visualize that *Prāṇatattva* in the attributed and the embodied form viz. *Hanumān*, or whether all this is simply a figment of imagination. Let us be rest assured that the sages themselves who have visualized him in the abovesaid form, have provided us the picture of *Hanumān*.

“ततः पश्यति धर्मात्मा तत्सर्वं योगमास्थितः”, “तत्सर्वं तत्त्वतो दृष्ट्वा धर्मेण स महाद्युतिः”

We too can see him in the same way if we acquire the *śuddha dṛshṭi* and *satyadṛshṭi* of those *Maharshis*. These words are not utterances of lunatics, or a propaganda of propagandists or poetic fancies or fanciful imaginations. But a universal truth which can be experienced by all cultured and refined people.

We would like to respectfully remember here a sentimentful context which emerged when our Mahārguru worshipped Hanumān through a stotragāna of Hanūmatpañcaratna after experiencing in the inner visions during the Brahmī state, both Lord Hanumān who is the attributed and embodied form of ŚrīRāma, along with ŚrīRāma, who in turn is the prāṇa of prāṇas. He had said “He is the master who can not only help in conquering the external enemies but also in conquering mighty wrestlers in the form of Yogavighnas. Characters such as Simhika, Akshakumāra etc., whom the Rāmayaṇa describes as the ones conquered by Hanumān are nothing but Yogavighnas. He is the one who grants siddhis. He is also a great help to the attainment of Moksha, by brining about the samādhi of Rāmabhakti Samrājya.

Thus, we have discussed about Lord *Hanumān*. We shall now take up the discussion on the celebration. \(of *Hanumajjayanti*.\)

### The day and time of the festival

When should this festival be celebrated? This topic can be discussed in two parts, viz the month, the day and the star on which it should be celebrated and precisely at what time of that day.

The three traditions that are in vouge in the celebration of Hanumajjayantī are as follows:

1. Celebrating on *Caitra Pūrṇimā*. 
2. Celebrating on *Kārtika Kṛshṇa Caturdaśī* 
3. Celebrating on *Margaśira śukla trayodaśī*. 

The last one is more in vogue in South India. The other two are more prevalent in North India. Moreover there is a custom of celebrating this festival on *Vaiśakha Kṛshṇa Trayodashī* also in South India.

Let us first have a look at the contents in the texts such as *Purāṇas, Pūjākalpas* etc. which are supportive of the above traditions, and later we shall take up the propriety of reasoning etc.

*Uthsava Sindhu* a book on *pūjākalpas* tells us that Lord *Śiva* himself took birth as a leader of the monkeys, in the womb of *Añjanā Devī* on a Tuesday in *Mesha lagna* and *Svāti nakshatra*, in the dark half of the *kārtika māsa*.

> ऊर्जस्य चासिते पक्षे स्वात्यां भौमे कपीश्वरः ।  
> मेषलग्नेऽञ्जनीगर्भात् शिवः प्रादुरभूत् स्वयम् ॥ 

*Vrata Ratnākara* expresses the same opinion in different words. The details of *Añjaneya’s* birth and childhood plays provided in the *Uttarakānḍa* of *Valmiki Rāmāyaṇa* also support the above said purport. In the book we see a verse as below -

यमेव दिवसं ह्येष ग्रहीतुं भास्करं प्लुतः ।  
> तमेव दिवसं राहुः जिघृक्षति दिवाकरम् ॥ \(रामा. उत्तरकाण्ड 35-31\) 

*Añjanādevī* had moved away to fetch food for the newborn baby *Āñjaneya*. At that time, the baby mistaking the rising sun for a fruit jumped to the skies to grab him. The same day *Rāhu* also wanted to seize the sun.

The solar eclipse takes place on a new moon day. *Mesha lagna* occurs only in the night of *Kārtikamāsa*. So we can guess that *Hanumān* was born on the night of *caturdaśī* of the *Kārtika* month. And the next day was *Amāvāsya*, on which the event of *Hanumān* leaping to catch the sun took place.

Then why did the tradition of worshipping *Āñjaneya* specially on *caitraśukla pūrṇimā* come into vogue? It is so because, festivities like the *Rāmanavamī*, the divine marriage between *Sītā* and *Rāma* and the coronation of *ŚrīRāma* are very close to *caitra pūrnimā*, and so it is quite natural to specially celebrate the festival of *Hanumān* who was the supreme devotee of *Rāma.* We can guess that this *Hanumāntotsava* itself was in course of time came to be celebrated as *Hanumajjayanthi*. Also, previously we have discerned at the *ślokas* of the *Purāṇas* which state that *Āñjaneya* was born as a partial incarnation of *Śiva*. The *Vāyavīya purāṇa* states that a special *pūja* called *‘Damanotsava’* should be offered to all the deities, and especially to *Śiva* on the day of *Caitra Śukla Pūrṇimā.*

> संवत्सरकृतार्चायाः साफल्यायाखिलान् सुरान् ।  
> दमनेनार्चयेच्चैत्र्यां विशेषेण सदाशिवम्” \(वा. पु. परि 11, पुट - 62\) 

Thus, this day on which a special *pūja* was offered to *Āñjaneya* who is revered as a partial incarnation of *Śiva*, later came to be known as *Hanumajjayantī* in traditon. In North India, this day is called *Pajūno Pūno*, and celebrated as a birthday of a prince by name *Pajūno* who was a *siddhapurusha*.

In South India, the thirteenth day of *Margaśira Śuddha māsa* is marked as *‘Hanumad Vratam’*. On the preceeding two days, *Vaikunṭha Ekadaśī* and *Dvadaśī* worships which are dear to *Mahāvishṇu* have been over. And on the full moon day, the grand festival of *Śiva* viz. *Andhakāsurasamhāra* have been over. And on the day of *trayodaśī* which falls between the two, it is but natural to worship *Hanumān* the brave super devotee, who is intimately connected to both *Vishṇu* and *Śiva*. It is possible that this day of worship itself was latter called as *Hanumajjayantī*.

Among these three different days of celebration, the second one i.e. the precept that *Hanumajjayantī* should be observed on *Kārtika Kṛshṇa Caturdaśi tithi* is in accordance with the clear statements of *ŚrīmadRāmāyaṇa* and the rule in the *Pūjaśāstras*. The month of *Kārtika* is dear to *Śiva*. And *Caturdaśī* of the dark half is even dearer. Therefore this is the day best suited for the worship of *Hanumān* also who is respected as the partial incarnation of *Śiva*. Thus, by the view points of both the *Śāstras* and the connection with the original deity \(i.e. *Śiva*\), it is most appropriate to consider *kārtika śukla caturdashi tithi* itself as the \(right\) day for \(the observation of\) *Hanumajjayanti*. The other two days proposed are also considered excellent for the worship of *Hanumān*. We have to understand that *KārtikaKṛshṇa Caturdaśī* is more preferable compared to the other two days for the worship of *Hanumān* as his birth day.

“When we came across contradictory statements in the *Purāṇas* with regard to any subject matter, we have to resolve the contradictions by concluding that the event occurred in one *kalpa* as per that *purāṇa* and the other occurred in another *kalpa* according to this *purāṇa*.” says a *purāṇa* precept.

> क्वचित् क्वचित्पुराणेषु विरोधे यदि लभ्यते ।  
> कल्पभेदादिभिस्तत्र व्यवस्था सद्भिरिष्यते” ॥ 

Thus all the three factions can be satisfied by holding that *Hanumāns’* birth took place on the fourteenth day of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* in the month of *Kārtika* in a certain *Kalpa*; in another *kalpa* it happened in *Mārgaśira Śuddha pūrnimā* and in yet in another *Kalpa* it took place on *Caitra Śuddha pūrnimā*. But many interpolations are seen in the statements of *Purāṇas*. Some statements give the purports which are not in tune with the main meaning. Also, as there are no clear *śāstravacanas* to state that the birth of *Hanumān* took place either in *Caitra* or *margaśira* we honour the tradition of celebrating the day on the *Kārtika Kṛshṇa caturdaśi* itself. It is popular to celebrate *Hanumajjayanthi* on *Vaiśakha Kṛshṇa daśami* in South India.

And at what time should the special *pūja* of *Hanumān* be performed on the day of *KarthikaKṛshṇa caturdaśī*? “His incarnation took place in the *Meshalagna*” say the *śāstras*. *Mesha lagna* occurs at night and on that night, that time happens to be *Māsaśivarātri* also. Therefore the special worship pertaining to his *avatāra* should be done in the night. And, it should be supposed that the day of worship shall be only on the day when *Caturdaśī tithi* extends through the night.

### *Pūja Vidhi:* \(Precepts of worship\)

Those who perform the *Vrata* should observe fast on that day. Those who cannot afford to fast may take *sāttvik* food such fruits, tubers, milk, etc., which have been offered to God. Those who just perform the *pūja* of *Hanumān* without the vows of the *vrata*, should be on fast until the *pūja* is over and take the *prasāda* afterwards. But those who do it as a *vrata* should be in observance for the whole day, in accordance to the vows made. And after the worship of *ŚrīRāma* in the night, the worship of *Prāṇadevaru*, his greatest servant, should be done. *Pañcopacāra pūja* or *shoḍaśopacāra pūja* should be offered, as per scriptural precepts. It is best to do *Pañcāmṛta abhisheka* in the *upacāra* of bath to the Lord. For decorating the Lord, applying of fragrant oil and *kuṅkuma* should be specially done. The best among *naivedyas* would be the preparation made with Bengal gram and jaggery. As part of *pūja*, just as music and dance are offered to the Lord, the offering of wrestling and gymnastics in the presence of the Lord as a form of *seva* is also in vogue. Those who are able \(bodied\), should keep awake for the whole night and keep singing the glories of the Lord.

### *Pūja* Rules and the Science behind that

1. As *Hanumān* is the preeminent servitor of *Parabrahmamūrtī ŚrīRāma*, it is proper that the *prasāda* that has been offered to *ŚrīRāma* is offered to *Hanumān* also. As proclaimed in the statements—

“दासोऽहं कोसलेन्द्रस्य रामस्याकिष्टकर्मणः”  
“अक्रूरस्त्वभिवन्दनेऽथ हनुमान् दास्ये च सख्येर्जुनः” 

*Hanumān* is the ultimate in *Dāsabhakti*. Devotees are indeed the seekers of *Prasāda* of Gods as is evident from “प्रसादं वाञ्छद्भिः” And it is right indeed to offer the *Prasāda* of *Rāma* who is the Lord of *Hanumān’s Prāṇa* and who is also a *prāṇārāma*.

Why is *Pañcamṛuta Abhisheka* specially prescribed to \(the worship of\) *Hanumān*? It is because, just like Lord *Śiva*, *Hanumān* is also *Abhishekapriya*. As he is the form of *pañcaprāṇas*, it is appropriate that he is given a holy bath of *pañcāmṛtas*. The five holy things are *kshīra* \(milk\) *dadhi*, \(curds\), *ghṛta* \(ghee\), *madhu* \(honey\) and sugar. These are called *pañcāmṛtas*. Each one of them has a special sweetness but all are tasty. Similarly, though there is a diversity in the five different worships to the Lord, all are dear \(tasty\) to god. All lead to happiness, both in this world and in the next. From the physical point of view also, they are great tonics for the cure of bodily and mental ailments.

a\) Cow’s milk is the best among milks. *Caraka Samhit* a describes this substance as one which is sweet cool, soft, oily, thick, sticky, heavy and pleasant; it increases vitality and it is the greatest elixir.

		
> स्वादु शीतं मृदु स्निग्धं गाढं च श्लक्ष्णपिच्छिलम् ।  
> गुरु मन्दं प्रसन्नं च गव्यं दशगुणं पयः ॥ 

> तदेवं गुणमेवौजः सामान्यादभिवर्धयेत् ।  
> प्रवरं जीवनीयानां क्षीरमुक्तं रसायनम् ॥ चरक. सू. \(27, 217-218\) 

b\) “Cow’s Curd is very tasty, increases heat, increases virility, unctuousness and increases strength. While being cooked, it produces sourness and heat. It removes rheumatism., It is auspicious and brings robustness, And cures a number of diseases like catarrh, diarrhea, cough, and remittent fever, tastelessness, urinary difficulties and weakness, says the same work.

रोचनं दीपनं वृष्यं स्नेहनं बलवर्धनम् ।  
> पाकेऽम्लमुष्णं वातघ्नं मङ्गल्यं बृंहणं दधि ॥  
> पीनसे चातिसारे च शीतके विषमज्वरे ।  
> अरुचौ मूत्रकृच्छ्रे च कार्श्ये च दधि शस्यते ॥ \(चरक, सू 27, 225-226\) 

**c\) Ghee:** “Cow’s ghee brightens intelligence, improves memory, provides strength, brings comprehending intelligence, is a purifier, removes rheumatism and exhaustion, sets right the voice, is antibilious, is a nourisher, improves digestion, is sweetish after digestion, increases vitality and causes firmness of the body. Cows’ ghee when freshly clarified has curative qualities. It is like nectar, antitoxic, good for the eyes, healthy and increases longevity of life, improves strength and intelligence and is the greatest elixir” says the *Yogaratnākara*.

> धीकान्तिस्मृतिकारकं बलकरं मेधाकरं शुद्धिकृत् ।  
> वातघ्नं श्रमनाशनं स्वरकरं पित्तापहं पुष्टिदम् ॥ 

> वह्नेः वृद्धिकरं विपाकमधुरं वृष्यं वपुःस्थैर्यदम् ।  
> सेव्यं गव्यघृतोत्तमं बहुगुणं सद्यः समावर्तितम् ॥ 

> सर्पिर्गवां चामृतकं विषघ्नम् 

> चक्षुष्यमारोग्यकरं च वृष्यम् ।  
> रसायनं मन्दमतीव मेध्यम्  
> स्नेहोत्तमं चेति बुधाः स्तुवन्ति ॥ 

**d\) Honey:** “Honey causes rheumatism, is heavy, cool, removes hemorrhages and phlegm, and heals cuts and wounds in the body. It has both sweetish and astringent tastes” says the *carakasamhitā*

वातलं गुरु शीतं च रक्तपित्तकफापहम् ।  
> सन्धातृच्छेदनं रूक्षं कषायमधुरं मधु \(चरक सू. 27-244\) 

**e\) Sugar:** All types of sugar remove thirst, hermorrhages, and heat in the body.

तृष्णाऽसृक्पित्तदाहेषु प्रशस्ताः सर्वशर्कराः ॥ \(चरक. सू. 27-241\) 

When we look at the qualities of these above five things, we find that every one of them has medicinal value, and, with a suitable combination, can remove defects mutually, \(if any\). For example, fasting increases acidity. But ghee and honey can remove acidity. Honey causes rheumatism, but curds removes it. *“Dadhi vātajit”.* It is well known that milk and ghee help to effectively get over many imbalances, produced by fasting.

“गव्ये क्षीरघृते श्रेष्ठे” \(अष्टांङ्ग - 5-41\) 

> उपवासाध्वभाष्यस्त्रीमारुतातपकर्मभिः क्लान्तानाम्  
> अनुपानार्थं पयः पथ्यं यथामृतम् ” \(चरक सू. 27-320\) 

Thus when with these things, which have great curative properties materially speaking, the graceful Lord is bathed and when the *Prasāda* is taken with a sense of devotion, the *prasāda* will bring about the tranquil of elements \(*dhātu prasannathe*\). Also, as these facilitate immortality they are appropriately called *Amṛta*.

\(A word of caution here please. This *prasāda* should be taken immediately after the *pūja* and not after a big time gap. If the gap is more, the consuming of the *Prasāda* may cause ill health.\)

2. Likewise the combination of Bengal gram and jaggery is an item which is highly recommended as a special *naivedya* to Lord *Hanumān*, is one which can bring about great benefits, in the wordly sense also.

“चणकः शीतलो रूक्षः पित्तरक्तकफापहः । लघुः कषायो विष्टम्भी वातलो ज्वरनाशनः ॥

says *Bhāvaprakāśa*

This substance is a coolant, effective in curing dryness, bile and phlegm. It makes the body \(feel\) light, is astringent and prevents the passage of stools, causes gas and cures fever. Raw Bengal gram is tender, very tasty, removes *Pittaśukra* and is a salutary foodstuff. Jaggery gives strength, causes heaviness of the body, is oily, removes rheumatism and purifies urine. Though Bengalgram is full of many qualities, it causes gas. But when added with jaggery, gas formation is prevented. By the combination of these two, benefits will increase and harmful effects vanish. When taken as a *prasāda*, afflictions of the mind also got removed. By taking this *naivedya*, the strengths of the body, mind and the self are brought about undoubtedly.

Why this Bengalgram and jaggery are specially suggested for *naivedya* to *Āñjaneyasvāmī*? Some may casually reply to this saying that they are liked very much by monkeys and as it is dear to God in the form of monkey, so they are recommended. This is not correct. Then, why not ground-nuts and jaggery which are loved more? Not only this. When monkies stoke each other’s body, they eat insects like the lice etc., found in the hairs. Some may even ask - why not that lice also be recommended as *naivedya* to *Hanumān* who has the form of a monkey? It is not for these reasons that the offering of Bengalgram and jaggery are recommended. So, we have to find out which offering helps to obtain the experience of the divine blissful form of *Hanumān*. The actual reason is, such an offering when taken \(by the devotees\), helps in the opening up of the centers which help the visualization of *Āñjaneya* and this can be known by the seekers of *Prakrti* & *Purusha*. The practice of offering garlands of betel leaves and garlands of *Uddina Vade \(a fried prepration of the common pulse\)* for the warding off evils, is also in vogue.

Now, regarding the display of wrestling and gymastic feats infront of *Hanumān*. *Hanumān* is the supreme wrestler in all the three worlds. By his grace, the art of wrestling can be mastered. It is but appropriate, that the display of that art is done before him as a form of *seva*. At the time of that offering one has to reflect that *Hanumān* is unequalled in conquering the wrestlers not only in the external world but also the demoniacal wrestlers in the inner world who are in the form of obstacles that impede the spiritual advancement of the *sādhakas*.

It is quite natural to reflect upon his story for the whole day and night on *Hanumajjayanti*. The *Sundarakānḍa* of the *Rāmāyaṇa* is aptly named as *‘Hanumadvijaya.’* Throughout this canto of the epic, the Joy of his great supremacy and successive victories shine forth.

“श्रुत्वा तु पञ्चमं काण्डं हनुमद्विजयाङ्कितम् ।”  
“हनुमद्विजयं काण्डं यः पारायणमाचरेत्॥” 

People chant this gem of an epic on that day with great devotion. Parts from other *Purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* which sing his glory can also be contemplated. When done so, all the *purushārthas* will be accomplished by the grace of that great Lord’s divine qualities and capabilities.

*Hanumān* who is worshipped as per the modalities stated above on the great day of *Hanumajjayanti*, is the supreme devotee of *ŚrīRāma* and the one who has *ananyabhāva* with *ŚrīRāma*.

When devotees worship him as stated in the following lines—

*“Tanna bhaktara jeevanave tanna jeevanam*  
*Tanna bhaktar tiḷiye tām bereyalla”*  
*“Hanumana matave hariya mata”* 

“The life of his devotees is his own life.

If the devotees understand him, he won’t be different”

“The thought of *Hanumān* itself is the thought of *Hari*”

and become one with his spirit, they undoubtedly attain *samādhi* in *ŚrīRāma*, who is the Lord of *Hanumān’s* soul.

Thus, *Hanumajjayanti* is one among the auspicious festivals which should be observed by all, who aspire for *śreyas* and *preyas*, as the celebration of the *jayantī* of *Hanumān* who was the supreme servitor and dear to *ŚrīRāma* and *Sītamāta*, pleases the Lord, and brings about the removal of bodily and mental ailments.

In addition to the important festivals described earlier, there are a number of festivals in the month of *Caitra* such as *Vasanta Navarātradurgāpūja* \(From the first day of *Caitra* for nine days, day and night\) *Bhrātṛdvitīya \(Caitra śuddha dvitīya\) Jagadiśa Vrata*, \(Four Mondays of *Caitra*\), *Arundhatī Vrata* \(From the first day of *Caitra* to the third\) *GaṇaGauriVrata* \(*Caitra śuddha Tṛitīya*\) *Śītalāshṭmī* \(*Caitra Kṛshṇa Ashṭamī*\) *Anaṅga Trayodaśī*, \(*Caitra śukla Trayodaśi*,\) etc. which are being observed. But only the most important festivals are discussed here, as examples. All festivals are important from the view point of devotees who celebrate them with devotion and enthusiasm and according to the precepts. Even so, only the most important festivals have been selected for discussion, keeping in mind the references in *śāstras* pertaining to those festivals, their range, depth, the people and their number who are entitled to observe them.





	 
## Holikotsava, Holi Habba, Vasantotsava

This is a famous festival celebrated all over India being called by the names *‘Hoḷāka’*, *‘Holikā’*, *‘Holī*‘, *‘Phālgunikā’ ‘Vasantotsava’* and *‘Kāmanahabba’* etc. Though there are differences regarding the day of observance and the modalities, it is celebrated throughout India. Thoughin some places the celebration is begun on *Vasantapañcamī*. \(i.e. *Māgha Śukla Pancamī*\) it is specially celebrated on the day of *Phālguṇa-Pūrṇimā* only. Activities like burning of a pile of fire wood, \(splashing\) of rose colored water, dancing with happiness and excitement etc, are generally seen in all places. Only in the Bengal region the custom of performing *‘Dolotsava’* on that day to Lord *Kṛshṇa* is in vogue.

**Determining the time of celebration:** This is a festival celebrated on *Phālguna Pūrṇimā*. But on the evening of *Pūrṇima*, the *Karaṇa* by name *Bhadrā* should not be prevailing. If it prevails for two days in the evening, or if it prevails partly during the next evening, the festival should be celebrated the next day only. If the blemish of *Bhadrā* prevails on the previous day, and if *pūrṇimā* doesn’t set in till the evening of the following day, or, if *pūrṇimā* prevails for a period of three *praharas* or more, the festival will be in the evening of the following day only. If *prathama* gets shorter, then the time of either the tail or the face of *Bhadrā* should be avoided, and *Holī* should be celebrated during the period of *Bhadrā* only. *Holī* should never be celebrated during day time.

### Some stories related to *Holi*:

We come across a number of stories in the *purāṇas* pertaining to the festival of *Holī*. Some of them may be summed up as follows. If the story is observed, the *tattva* and the modalities related to the festival can be understood well.

According to one story, *Holikā* was the sister of *Hiraṇyāksha* and *Hiraṇya Kaśipu*. She was a *Mahāmāyāvini* who possessed *‘Agnisiddhi’*. She had the capacity to remain unharmed even when she sat on fire. Though *Hiraṇyakaśipu* the king of demons tried to kill his son *Prahlāda* who was a great devotee of Lord *Mahāviśṇu* in many ways, he could not succeed. Then he ordered his sister *Holikā*:— Holding *Prahlāda* “you sit on a burning fire. He will be burnt to ashes; but you will come out of the fire unscathed as usual”. Honouring the orders of the elder brother, she embraced *Prahlāda* and made him sit on her lap, and asked the demons to pile up firewood on her, and set it on fire. When fire was lit as told, the result was contrary to what *Holikā* intended. *Prahlāda* sat comfortably without any torment of heat as a result of his devotion to *Viśṇu*. Though *Holikā* kept screaming with distress due to intense heat, the demons felt that she was screaming so, only out of mercy for *Prahlāda* and started adding more and more firewood to the fire. In the end *Holikā* the female demon was completely burnt to ashes without even a trace of her bones. *Prahlāda* came out of the heap of ash happily and started singing the praises of God. *Holikā* suffered on account of her own sins, and the pious person \(i.e. *Prahlāda*\) got saved. In memory of this, the festival of the burning of fire wood began.

According to another story, this festival is in memory of the killing of a female demon by name *‘Dhunḍhā’*, who was killing infants,during the time of king *Pṛthu* alias *Raghu* in *Satyayuga.* That wicked female demon, roaming through day and night, used to grab children found in lonely places without getting noticed by others, and kill them. Some children would get struck with illness the moment they saw her and would suffer extreme distress. No person could capture that female demon who was a witch. She was the daughter of a demon king by name *‘Mālī’*. By observing a severe penance addressing *Śiva*, she obtained a boon by which she could not be killed either by young or old men, *Devatas*, or any animal. She ignored children thinking that they could cause no harm to her. The king getting to know of this secret from the great sage *Vasishṭha*, appointed some wayward boys to capture her. Frightened by this, she tried to hide, run away and so on, trying to save her life. But the king ordered all the boys in the country to dance frenziedly and to make a pile of fire wood, dirt, and dried cakes of cow dung etc, and to set fire to it. When the boys did so, she became frightened and left the human world itself and ran away. In memory of this, the custom of setting of fire in the festival of *Holī* has come into vogue.

Another famous story is related to the *Kāmadahana* performed by *Śiva*. *Kāmadeva* tried to stir the mind of Lord *Rudra* who was immersed in *Samādhi*. Then the fire which erupted from the forehead of *Śiva* burnt down that cupid to ashes. This story is seen in all the *purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* also. *Holi* festival is observed in memory of the burning of that *Kāmadeva* which involves the custom of setting fire and burning \(firewood etc.,\)

This festival is also called the festival of the season, the festival of burning of a female demon or the festival of the burning of *Kāma*

It is also possible that the festival is named *Holikā*, after a sweet dish called *Holikā* or *Holige* which is specially prepared and offered as *naivedya* to God, and then taken as *prasāda*.

Just as the event of *Mahādeva* burning down *Kāmadeva* is observed with joy, there is also a custom of invoking *Kāmadeva* on that day and worshipping him with *shoḍaśopacāras*, and consuming the flowers and tender sprouts of mango as *prasāda*. Thus, this is a distinct practice of observing the same festival in the form of both the subjugation of *Kāmadeva* and also seeking his blessings. \(This is because *Kāmadeva* becomes worshipful or abandonable depending upon the context and the person involved.\)

As the festival is celebrated in the month of *‘Phālguna’* it is called *‘Phālgunikā’*. *Holikā* and other names have come because of the female demon, or the special dish. As the worship of *Kāmadeva*, the friend of *Vasanta* is performed, it is also called *Vasantotsava* and the festival of *Kāmadeva*.

The festival of *Kāmadahana* itself might have become, in short, the festival of *Kāma*.

### The method of celebration of the festival:

As observed earlier, there are many ways in which the festival is celebrated. In *Vangadeśa* it is observed in the form of *‘Dolayātra* of *ŚrīKṛshṇa’*. The festival is celebrated there for three or five days. *Agnideva* should be worshipped on the night of the *caturdaśī* of the bright half of *Phālguna*, on the eastern side of the pandal.

An idol of Lord *Govinda* should be made, and should be installed on the platform of a *pandal* having sixteen pillars. The Lord should be given a holy bath with *‘Pancāmṛta’* etc., and should be decorated and placed on the cradle, and should be swung seven times. The sacred fire that has been lighted up on the first day of the festival, should be kept burning till the festival is completed. In the end the cradle should be swung twenty-one times. It is believed that the great king *Indradyumna* started this festival in *Vṛndāvana*. Pūrṇimā tithi is important for this festival. Whether the star *Uttaraphālguni* prevails or not, this festival should be observed if *Pūrṇimā* prevails.

According to another scriptural rule, *tarpaṇa* should be offered to *Devatās* and *Pitṛdevatās*, and the dust of *Holi* should be saluted to ward off blemishes. The courtyard of the house should be mopped up and cleaned with a wet cloth and decorated with *śobhanākshatā* and *Raṅgavalli*, and then a white cloth pedestal should be placed in the centre. A *kalaśa* with tender mango leaves on it should be installed, and golden colored *akshatās* should be offered to the holy pot, and white sandal paste should be anointed on it, and a red cloth should be wrapped around it, and should be decorated with garlands of flower. On the top of the *kalaśa*, an idol of *Kāmadeva* adorned with flowers and accompanied by *Ratidevī* should be installed. He should be worshipped with sandal paste, flowers, incense, *dīpa* and *naivedya* and then he should be offered *arghya*. After the worship of *Kāmadeva* like this, a person who has restrained his senses should chant the *Veda mantras*. Women with auspicious marks, and wearing ornaments of red colored beads and bangles, should worship the sandal-wood tree. If the worship is done with the offerings of garland of flowers, curds, *dūrvā* and *akshatā*, and then saluted, one is bestowed with the enhancement of life span and good health.

Then the tender mango leaves together with sandal paste should be consumed saying ‘Let *Kāmadeva* be pleased’, and gifts etc should be given in keeping with one’s ability. Afterwards, at the time of taking food, well cooked *pāyasānna* should be taken first and other dishes of choice should be had afterwards.

> वृत्ते तुषारसमये सितपादश्याः  
> प्रातर्वसन्तसमये समुपस्थिते च।  
> सम्प्राश्य चूतकुसुमं सह चन्दनेन  
> सत्यं हि पार्थ सततं पुरुषस्सुखी स्यात् ॥ 

Those who consider the *Holi* festival as a festival of driving out the female demon *‘Dhunḍhā’* with the belief that misfortunes get warded off if she is worshipped first and then driven away, follow the modality as follows:— Right from the night of *Vasantapañcami*, preparations for the *Holikādahana* begin. A person purified by bath etc should install a branch of a tree in a specific place. Then he should take a vow—“I with my family am doing the worship of *Holikā* for the pleasure of the female demon *Dhunḍhā Rākshasī* so that I get free from her torments”. Then he should be under *Vrata Niyamās* for the whole day. Keeping that branch of the tree as the centre, he should collect dried firewood and cakes of dried cowdung. All people should cooperate in this work. Children should be given small pieces of fire wood, and just for fun, should be made to enjoy a free mock fight mutually, fancying the pieces of firewood as swords. Then that female demon who was invoked in that heap of wood should be offered *Shodaśopacāras* with the chanting of a *śloka* which carries the following meaining.

“O *Holikā* \! The boys frightened by the diseases caused by you, drove you away. Therefore I worship you, O\! *Bhūtā* \! Bless me with prosperity”. \(“असृक्यामयसन्त्रस्तैः कृता त्वं होलि बालिशैः । अतस्त्वां पूजयिष्यामि भूते भूतिप्रदा भव॥”\) \(Water sanctified by *mantras* should be sprinkled on the pile of pieces of wood in which the demon is invoked and then firewood should be heaped on it\). Then, Fire from the house of the most impure or from the house of a woman who has recently delivered a child, should be fetched through children, and the pile of firewood should be set on fire. Everyone should circumambulate that fire three times, and all should indulge in gossip, singing, laughter, amusement and dancing, unabashed.

> तमग्निं त्रिः परिक्रम्य गायन्तु च हसन्तु च।  
> जल्पन्तु स्वेच्छया लोका निश्शङ्क,आ यस्य यन्मतम् ॥ 

Starting from *pañcamī*, *Holikā Dahana* should be done for all the ten days with stolen firewood for fun. And on *Pūrṇimā*, fire should be lit. This act should be performed either outside the village or in the centre. The king himself, purified by bath etc and getting the *svastivācana* done, should arrive there to the tune of music band, and after making gifts, should light the fire.

> दशस्युः शोभनास्तास्तु काष्ठस्तेयं विधीयते।  
> चण्डालसूतिकागेहाच्छिशुहारितवह्निना ॥ 

> प्राप्तायां पूर्णिमायां तु कुर्यात्काष्ठप्रदीपनम् ।  
> ग्रामाद्बहिश्च मध्ये वा तूर्यनादसमन्वितः ॥ 

> स्नात्वा राजा शुचिर्भूत्वा स्वस्तिवाचनतत्परः।  
> दत्वा दानानि भूरीणि दीपयेद्धोलिकाचितिम् ॥ 

Then pouring ghee and milk on that fire and putting out the fire of the central post with cold water, it should be kept in a secluded place. Coconuts, pomegranate and guava fruits should be gifted. That night should be spent happily with dance, vocal music and instrumental music. Afterwards, that fire should be circumambulated three times and obnoxious words should be uttered. The female demon gets satisfied by those words. The plants of wheat, chick-peas and barley-corn should be burnt in that fire and should be brought home along with the ashes. Everyone at home should smear his body with that ash. In some places, there is also a practice of heating water for bath on the following day, with the fire that was brought home.

After observing *Holikotsava* in this way during the night, people belonging to all classes of society should come together and enjoy the pleasures of *Amoda, Pramoda*, sports and amusements. The custom of offering rose colored water first to God and then to elders in small quantities, and the remaining rose water being taken as *prasāda*, and splashing it with syringes etc, on each other and enjoying it, has been there from ages.. \(But some people say that this is a part of *Vasantotsava* and not a part of *Holikotsava*. And, all these viz., the festival of worshipping *Kāmadeva*, the festival of praising *Śiva* for burning down *Kāmadeva*, the expulsion of the female demons *Dhunḍhī* and *‘Holikā’* - all these are combined in the festival that is observed this way\). This *vidhi* of setting fire to both the female demon *Dhunḍhī* who was an agony for children, and *Hoilkā* the female demon who burnt herself to death while trying to burn down the boy *Prahlāda*, is representative of burning down both of these female demons. The incident of *Rudra* burning down the wicked *Manmatha* by his foreheadfire for disturbing his penance is also praised hereby. People from the lower strata of society capriciously utter vulgar words, expressing happiness at the sorrow of the family of *Kāmadeva* after he was burnt down.

Though there is diversity in the modalities of this festival, it is indeed observed all over the country. There can be no doubt at all in the fact that this is one of the most important festivals of *Bhārata*.

In this row of festivals, the *Śrāvaṇī \(upākarma\)*, *Dasaharā \(śarannavarātra\), Dīpāvalī* and *Holi*—are sometimes categorised as the most important festivals for the *Brāhmaṇas, Kshatriyas, Vaiśyas* and *Sūdras* respectively. The wearing of the sacred thread and the beginning of the study of *the Veda*s are related to the twice born, as evident from “उपवीतं सार्ववर्णिकम्”,*Śastras* permit even some non-*Brāhmins* to wear the sacred thread for some special reasons. So, it may be said that *‘Śravaṇi’* \(the festival of the sacred thread\) belongs to people all the *varṇas*. One may ask-“The non-twice borns have no right to begin the study of the *Veda*s. Therefore how can *Upākarma* be a festival for the people of all the *varṇas*? The answer is, even though they are not supposed to study the *Veda*s directly, people of all the *varṇas* have access to the study of *Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata* and *purāṇas*, which are the counterparts of the *Veda*s, and every one has the right to divine knowledge *\(jnāna\)* whichthe is the important substance of *Vedas* of and which is main objective of the *Veda*s. The tradition of our sages proclaims that people of all classes have the right to acquire divine knowledge and obtain *ātmoddhāra*. That people of all classes have the right to study *Śastras* like sculpture etc, is established by the *‘Nishādasthapatinyāya’* which is famous in scriptures. It is prolixity to consider the word *‘nishādasthapati’* as a *‘tatpurusha- samāsa* and resolving it, whereas it is brevity to consider it only as *‘karmadhāraya samāsa’* Therefore, the correct meaning of the sentence is that *yajna* should be gotten performed by a sculptor belonging to the caste of hunters \(*Nishādaścāsau sthapatiśca*\). Then one may question-“But the hunter has no right for the study of the *Veda*s\! He has no right to perform any *yajnas*, isn’t it?” The answer is, he also does have the right in some distinct *yajna*s. He can also be taught the *mantras* which are related to those *yajna*s. This is the conclusion of the *Mīmāmsa Śastra*.

This is called *‘nishādasthapati nyāya’*. By this conclusion, *Śrāvaṇi* becomes a festival of all people indeed. And, as it is well known that *Śarannavarātra*, *Dīpavali* and *Holi* are observed by the people of all *varṇas*, there is no doubt that *‘Śrāvaṇi’* is a festival of all. \(On the day of *Upākarma*, there is a practice of getting the protective sacred thread tied around the wrist of the right hand \(*rakshā-bandhana*\) by people of all *varṇas*. This custom is specially seen in North India\). So it is not correct to interpret that the above four festivals are limited only to certain *varṇas*. It can be generally said that that people of certain *varṇas* have special interest in certain festivals. Only because some people use vulgar language in the *Holi* festival, it is not correct to interpret that it is a festival of the people of the fourth *varṇa* only. It shall be indeed conforming to the *Śastras* if people celebrate it as per their culture. There is no doubt that it is the best option for everyone to ascend to the ideal of a superior culture. \(There is a scriptural rule that *‘yajna’* should be gotten performed by *‘Nishāda Sthapati’*. One may ask—A *nishāda* belongs to the fifth *varṇa*. How can he have the right to perform a *yajna*? The answer is, the term *Nishāda Sthapati* refers to a twice born *sthapati* who is patronized by a king who belongs to the caste of *Nishāda*. \(*“Nishādasya-Sthapatih”* is a *‘tatpurushsamāsa’*. The *yajna* should be gotten performed by such a person only. *Sthapati* means a sculptor. The opinion of the *pūrvapaksha* here is that a person who belongs to the fifth *varṇa* has no right to perform any *yajna*\).

Thus, we have discussed the various modalities of the *Holi* festival. Now, we shall drive home some important matters related to this festival in the format of questions and answers.

Question 1: - The above festival is observed by some in the form of *olā*—worship of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. Some others observe it in the form of worship of *Kāmadeva*. There are also people who consider it as a worship of *Śiva* who burnt down *Kāmadeva*. It is also observed as a festival of the demolition of the pride of the female demon *Dhunḍhī* or *Holikā*. Are not these an example of a strange mixture of cultures opposed to each other?

Answer: There is not even a bit of an admixture of different cultures in this. When two very important events occur on the same day, there is nothing wrong indeed in observing a festival, praising both of them on the same day itself. In this example, the burning down of *Manmatha* and the burning down of *Holikā* the female demon, are considered two events that occurred on the same day, and both the happy events are celebrated as a part of the same festival. There is no admixture of different cultures at all here. The burning down of the wicked *Manmatha* and the burning down of the wicked female demon who wanted to cause adversities to the devotees of God-both these are indeed dear to the virtuous. Actually speaking, it is more appropriate and beneficial to treat both of these events as *tāttvik* events, than considering them as historical happenings.

Question 2: What is the *tāttvik* sense present in the burning down of *Kāma* and *Hoilkā* the female demon?

Answer: - *Kāma* is a vile *vikāra* that disturbs the *dhyānasamādhi* of God. *Manmatha* means the churning of the mind. \(“मनः मथ्नाति इति मन्मथः”\). It is a great enemy of *yogis* and the all pious people who are engaged in serious work. It is clear that God himself has blamed this wicked thing \(*Kāma*\) in the *Gīta* as follows:- “This is *Kāma*. This itself assumes the form of anger. It is begotten of the element of *rajas*. It is insatiable even with sizeable quantities of food consumed, and is grossly very wicked. Know this as an enemy”. काम एषः क्रोध एषः रजोगुणसमुद्भवः । महाशनो महापाप्मा विध्येनमिह वैरिणम्” Lord *Mahādeva* who is beyond the *triguṇās* remains a great *yogīśvara* by burning down this wicked enemy.

It is the attitude of the virtuous to pray \(Lord *Śiva*\) to wish that everyone should try to restrain this enemy. The *tāttvik* sense of *Kāmadahana* is to obtain inspiration by praising the destruction of the wicked enemy, brought about by the great Lord of *Yoga*.

*Prahlāda* is indeed a representative of the steadfast devotion to *Vishṇu*. The name *‘Prahlāda’* is an appropriate one, because complete and exalted bliss is indeed the result of such a devotion to God. *Holikā* is a terrible wicked force that ruins such a *Bhakti Yoga*. It disturbs the ordinary devotees. But when it tries to disturb the *Samādhi* of people like *Prahlāda* who are at the zenith of devotion, it gets burnt by itself due to the sin of *Bhāgavatāpacāra*. Thus the precept of *Hoilka Dahana* drives home to us very convincingly, the glory of the devotion to God, and also the harm that is reaped for causing *apacāra* to *Bhāgavatas*.

Question 3: - *Jnānis* say that *Kāma* is highly wicked and extremely difficult to restrain. So, the custom of setting fire to and burning the firewood of *Kāma* which is such an enemy, and which was subjugated by *Mahādeva* with his *Yogabala*, and so, praising the great glory of *Mahādeva* during this custom, is both meaningful and effective. It may be even right to disparage *Kāma* as it is a wicked thing. But why did the custom of worshipping *Kāmadeva* on that day itself has come into practice? Is *Kāma* fit for contempt or is he worshipful? Were the sages themselves uncertain about this? Or, is there a synthesis of both the opinions of disdain and praise? Also, is it possible that the same person becomes worshipful at certain times and disdainful at other times?

Answer: - The same *Kāmadeva* becomes fit to be rejected at certain times and worshipful at other times. There are sentences of reproach in *Śrībhagavadgīta*, which refer to *Kāma* as a great sinner and a great enemy.

महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम्

The very same *Bhagavad-Gīta* proclaims that *Kāma* which is not opposed to *Dharma,* is a form dear to God.

धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामो एस्मि भरतर्षभ”

Question 4: Can’t it be that the *Gītacārya*, also was in a state of confusion, as he brands the same thing as both boding ill and desirable in the same breath?

Answer: -The *Gītacārya* does not have even an iota of either illusion, doubt, *viparyaya* or confusion. He has preached the *Gīta* only to remove such confusions.

Question 5: - Anyway is it not a contradiction that the same person describes a stuff, both as something to be eschewed and to be revered\!

Answer: There is no such contradiction in the teaching of *Gīta* at all. One can find around that the same person becomes fit to be disdained at certain times and may become respectable at some other times. At present, when *Kāma* works against *Dhyāna*, *Tapas*, restraint of the senses and discipline, it becomes something to be rejected. But when it fosters *Dharma* it becomes worshipful. The \(stories of\) *Gopikās* described in *Śrīmadbhāgavata*, the stories of *Anḍaḷ, Akkamahādevi* and *Mīrādevi* stand out as examples for the point that *Kāma* related to divinity can lead to *jnānasamādhi* itself.

Our national poet *Kālidāsa* convinces through beautiful examples in his *Kumārasambhava*, that *Kāma* can be either *Tyājya* or *Pūjya* to the same person, depending upon the context and situation. Lord *Śiva* burnt down *Manmatha* to ashes when he tried to disturb his *Tapassamādhi*. But, says the great poet, when *Śiva* was seated with *Pārvatī* on the *Hasemaṇe* as a bridegroom, he himself welcomed the shooting of arrows from *Kāmadeva*.

> तपःपरामर्शविवृद्ध मन्योः. . . . कृशानुः किल निष्पपात।  
> तावत्स वह्निर्भवनेत्रजन्मा भस्मावशेषं मदनं चकार ॥ \(सर्ग 3/71-72\)  
> तस्यानुमेने भगवान्विमन्युः व्यापारमात्मन्यपि सायकानाम् । \(सर्ग-7-93\) 

*Śrī Raṅgamahāguru* had explained to us in a beautiful pity sentence, how either *Kāma* becomes *Tyājya* or *Pūjya*. “When *Kāma* comes as one of the group of the six inner enemies \(viz., *Kāma*, *Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, and Mātsarya*\) it becomes *Tyājya*. This was his loud statement. He had also explained that when *Kāma* is controlled by *Dharma* and *Moksha* on both sides, it indeed becomes fit to be welcomed.

In the present *parva,* both the burning down and worshipping of *Kāma* conform to *Dharma* only. This custom drives home a moral to us -i.e. when he *Kāma* facilitates *Dharma*, the seekers should worship him and he should be destroyed if found opposed to *tapassamyama*. Thus it becomes a festival of both, i.e the worshipping of *Kāma* and the burning down of *Kāma*.

Question 6: - Is it not bad manners to splash colored water on anybody and everybody that comes by during the festival of *Kāma* and foul their things?

Answer: - It is not civilized behaviour to splash coloured water on any person who comes by. The *Śāstras* do not approve of this as civilized behaviour. But it will not be an offending act if it is splashed on a person within the limits of decency, provided that person also is in a state of delight, with the clear knowledge of the meaning and spiritual aspect of that festival. It is not decency at all to throw mire on a person instead of *Vasantodaka*.

Question 7: - *Kāma* may be wicked on some occasions. *Holikā* the female demon also might have indulged in very bad deeds. And so the custom of hurling obnoxious and vulgar words at them with no bounds, is in vogue in this festival. Moreover it is said that the more the female demon *Dhunḍhā* hears it, the more she feels happy. Are all these right?

Answer: - Decent people do not use vulgar words in public as a part of the festival. Only lay people of a very low level, indulge in such a thing. In festivities of happiness, it won’t be considered a great offence, if a few holds are relaxed to a little extent.

Moreover the statement that *Dhunḍha* the female demon feels happy all the more when she hears bad words, has a moral to deliver-“Bad words please only the demoniacal forces but shall not cause happiness to the divine forces”-This is the *tattva* hidden here.

Critics observe one more thing here. The wicked tendency to use foul language is generally present more or less in all people. \(There may be exceptions to this\). An important aspect to be noted here is that such people should follow civility by satiating themselves with that addiction only on that day of the festival, and in the remaining days should speak only decently. This spirit is also hidden here.

Question 8: - Should the female demons *Dhunḍha* and *Holikā* be worshipped on that day or should they be driven away?

Answer: - They should be worshipped first and then should be driven far away, asking them not to wander or roam about until the following year’s festival.

Question 9: Both the concepts i.e. the burning down of *Kāma* and *Holikā* the female demon, and accordingly collecting firewood and piling them and burning them is all O.K. But the rule that firewood should be collected by theft and fire should be brought from the house of persons contracted with impurity, and that it should be used to light fire is laiddown. Is this right? Is it not better to collect firewood through fair means and set it on fire by the fire brought from the house of persons who are pure?

Answer: Collecting material by fair means is a good *Dharma*. Even though *Agni* is by itself pure, fire from the home of persons who are pure is much purer no doubt. But the evil forces do not relish such *samskāras* which are full of righteousness. The purport here is that their birth, existence, desire for life and the final rites are all filthy. But persons who experiment this purport have to be careful not to really get stuck to that filth.

Question 10: - What is the reason for the practice of bringing home the ashes of the burnt fire and smearing it on the body?

Answer: - We hear the story of Lord *Mahādeva* who killed the demon *Tripura* and applied the ashes of that demon as a mark of his victory. “If one smears the ashes of burnt *Kāma* \(*Holikā*\) with a feeling of *prasāda*, and with the remembrance that by the grace \(blessings\) of God, the evil *Kāma* was destroyed and the forces of demons were vanquished, then only it comes to be called as *Rakshā*. By that, the misfortunes get warded off and inspiration to \(follow the path of\) *Dharma* and devotion to God will be obtained.

Question 11: - The idea of burning down *Kāma* is good. It’s external symbol \(i.e. the heap of fire wood\) can be burnt down to ashes by fire. But *Kāma* is *manasija*. The one which is born in the mind\). It is aptly called by *Jnānis* by names such as *‘Manmatha”* \(the one which churns the mind\), *Madana* \(the one which causes infatuation\) etc. Like the proverbial head of *Rāvaṇa*, it keeps growing again and again though severed. *Devatās* also become the victims of its attack. When it is so, is it possible to destroy it?

Answer: - We come across stories which say—“Vanquishing of *Kāma* is no doubt very difficult but not impossible; Lord *Mahādeva* burnt it down, the great Sage *Nārāyaṇa* trampled it and let out a loud laughter” etc. It \(i.e. *Kāma*\) vanishes only when one achieves a total *Samādhi* in the *Parañjyoti* who is called *Śankara* and *Nārāyaṇa*. Knowledgeable persons say that till that \(state is achieved\), its *samskāra* will be present in some proportion even in ascetics. The purport of the following *śloka* of *Bhagavadgīt*a is well remembered here:—

> विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।  
> रसवर्जं रसोप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥ \(2-59\) 

“When a person does not consume foods \(objects of senses\), those objects turn away from him. But the *rasa \(rāga\)* does not get away merely by that. Only when the *Parabrahman* is realised, that *rasa \(rāga\)* vanishes”.

For example- On the days of *ekādaśī*, even during fasting, the mind of a person may be filled up with the *rasa \(rāga\)* of the various food items viz. *Bhakshya, Bhojya, Coshya, Lehya* and *Pānīyas* to be consumed on *Dvādaśi* for *Pāraṇa* \(only if he is not in the *rasa* of *Bhagavaddhyāna- Samādhi*\) If one is immersed in *Bhagavaddhyāna Samādhi*, even that undesirable relish also gets dried up in the fire of divine knowledge. And if one keeps on weakening the wicked *Kāma* by means of holy company, pure food and good thoughts etc. and attains *Paramātma Samādhi*, it gets completely dried up even without a trace.

When *Śrīrāma* severed the heads of *Rāvaṇa*, they kept on sprouting again and again. Finally, when He shot the *Brahmāstra* at the heart of the demon, *Rāvaṇa* was slain, isn’t it? So also, when *Brahmāstra* is shot at the mind which is the origin of *Kāma*, it gets destroyed. Though this can be done with very great difficulty, it becomes possible indeed, in the ripening of *Tapassamādhi*.

So much for *Samādhi*. But in day to day life, it is commendable to have desires which foster the welfare of the soul and the welfare of the world. But even then, the desires pertaining to the maintenance of the world should be in bounds and should merge in *AtmaKāma* \(love of *Brahma*\) only.





	 
## Janma Dina And Puṇya Tithi of ŚrĪ Guru-Ācāryas

God addressed by various names, *Śrī Rāma*, *Śrī Kṛshṇa*, *Śrī Śiva*, *Śrī Subrahmaṇya* and the festival and holy days addressing the distinct deities with distinguishing divine attributes and glories, have been discussed in the preceding chapters. Similarly, there are customs in our culture to observe with devotion and enthusiasm the festivals and holy days addressing preceptors, who have realized the essence of the Supreme Being, who have guided people in the divine realization path and the path of righteous order. Realized *mahatmas* like Jain *tīrthankaras, Gautamabuddha, Śrī Śaṅkara, Śrī Rāmānuja, Śrī Madhva, Śrī Basveśvara* are some of the elite preceptors. Great souls who having realized the divine principle themselves guide others to realize those divine principles, who conducted themselves in accordance with the canons, and who shone as the guiding lights for the world at large are called *‘ācārya*s’ \[One who professes what he practices\]. Their propitious reminiscences are observed on the lunar day \(*tithi*\) of their birth and their passing away, by meditating on them, offering worship, reading their history, chanting and singing about them. These days have the same reverence and respect as the festivals and holy days addressed to distinguishing divine attributes in the form of deities. We will discuss this topic, briefly.

There is a need to explain who exactly is an *‘ācārya’*. Ordinarily, the world’s famous heads of religious orders \(*māṭhas*\) and religious chairs are considered *‘ācārya’*. But, for this reason alone, the right to be an orthodox *ācārya*-hood is not attained. Since, there are instances where people have earned these titles due to various political reasons, without realization, devotion, detachment, pious conduct, ability to guide others in the righteous path, deliberation on the subject is necessary. “One who teaches the *vedas* and the associated scriptures, one who provides interpretative narration of *‘mantra’*, a twice born \(*dvija*\) performs *‘upanayana’* \[an initiation ceremony\] of a disciple and teaches them esoteric *‘vedas’*, one who preaches the meaning of the scriptures, helps students to establish themselves in the righteous path, and who themselves follows the prescribed righteous path, and a great person who is a beacon of light for people etc. are some of the explanations of the attributes for the term *‘ācārya’* we notice in the scriptures. The term *‘ācārya’* is also used as a derivative for the term *‘Guru’*. The gap between a teacher and an *‘ācārya’* is illustrated by the following quotation in the scriptures. ‘One who teaches *veda* or any part of *‘vedaangas’* as a vocation is an *‘upādhyāya’* \[a teacher\]. One who is blessed with ten times more superior grace and who performs *‘upanayana’* and teaches esoteric *‘veda’* in its entirety is an *‘ācārya’*

> मन्त्रव्याख्याकृदाचार्यः” \(अमरकोश\)  
> उपनीय तु यश्शिष्यं वेदमध्यापयेदि्द्वजः ।  
> सकल्पं सरहस्यं च तमाचार्यं प्रचक्षते ॥ 

एकदेशं तु वेदस्य वेदाङ्गान्यपि वा पुनः ।  
> योऽध्यापयति वृत्त्यर्थं उपाध्यायः स उच्यते ॥”  
“उपाध्यायात् दशाचार्यः” \(मनु. 1-140-141,145\) 

One who performs *‘garbhādhāna’* \(impregnation sacrament\) as prescribed in the scriptures and brings up \[a child\] with nourishment is a *‘Guru’*.

> निषेकादीनि कर्माणि यः करोति यथाविधि।  
> सम्भावयति चान्नेन स विप्रो गुरुरुच्यते॥ \(मनु 1-142\) 

These five namely, mother, father, *‘ācārya’*, maternal uncle, father-in-law, are regarded as *‘guru’*.

> गुरुवः पा सर्वेषां चतुर्णां श्रुतिचोदिताः।  
> माता पिता तथोचार्यः मातुलः श्वश्रवस्तथा ॥ \(योगयाज्ञवल्कय\)  
> गुकारस्त्वन्धकारः स्यात् रुशब्दस्तन्निवर्तकः” 

Furthermore, “ *‘gu’* means darkness \[ignorance\]. One who removes it is *‘Guru’*” i.e one who sheds the night of ignorance \[of a student\]. This is how the term *‘Guru’* is described. Although technically, the term *‘Guru’* has all these meanings, we use the term *‘ācārya’* in this work to mean, one who has realized the Supreme Being in soul, and who as a guide causes the commencement of the soul power in disciples, and graces them with the bliss of the divine knowledge of the Supreme Being. This view does not contradict with the other descriptions provided above. It binds the term into a class with a definitive meaning.

Even if someone does not teach *veda* verses, but having personally realized the Supreme which is propounded in *veda*s teaches that art of realization to students, becomes an *‘ācārya’*

Some orthodox people say, “A person who has not written a commentary for any of the three scriptures, *upanishad, brahma sūtra* and *Bhagavad Gīta* will not become an *ācārya*. Since, only a realized person could have written a commentary for the three divine treatises, we agree he is an *ācārya*. However, we do not agree that if a person has not written a commentary for the treatises is not an *ācārya*. Because, according to this constrained attribute *vedavyāsa* would not be an *ācārya* even though he authored *Brahma sūtra* and *Bhagavad Gīta*, he did not write their commentary\! Not even the Supreme Being would be an *ācārya*, because he did not write commentaries for the above scriptures\! The limiting attributes discussed above have not been decreed by the scriptures. An *ācārya* should be an intuitively \(*aparoksha*\) realized person, and should have the virtue of righteous conduct and should be a guide, are only the qualities established by the scriptures. The term *ācārya* according to grammar conveys the meaning *ācārya* is the one who practices the professed \(*ācāryate anena*, ā \+ *caragatau* \+ *Nyat*\). It conveys the intent that for an *ācārya*, the practice is as important as that which is being preached.

*Ācārya Vedāntadeśika* describes the nature, attribute, disposition and glory of an *ācārya* as follows:

‘He should be a spiritual adept, he should be an adept in the right religious order \(custom\), he should have unwavering wisdom, he should be sinless, he should be a theologian \(philosopher\) well-grounded on the Supreme, he should be established in truth, he should speak truthfully, he should be pious as dictated by the doctrine, he should be free of un-divine attributes \(*anātma guṇa*s\) such as false pride, jealousy, he should have conquered senses \(*jitendriya*\), he should be a friend of the entire world \(*dīrgha-bandhu*\), he should be compassionate \(*dayālu*\), he should correct the errors committed by his students, he should be interested in welfare of others and himself.

> सिद्धं सत्सम्प्रदाये स्थिरधियमनघं श्रोत्रियं ब्रह्ममनिष्ठम्   
> सत्त्वस्थं सत्यवाचं समयनियतया साधुवृत्या समेतम् ।   
> दम्भासूयाविमुक्तं जितविषयगणं दीर्घबन्धुं दयालुम्  
> स्खालित्ये शासितारं स्वपरहितपरं देशिकं भूष्णुरीप्सेत् ॥ 

He further proclaims, this type of greatest among all persons should be looked up as an equal to God, and \[a student should\] serve them without desiring favors in return \(*pratyupakāra*\)

आचार्यस्सद्भिरप्रत्युपकरणधिया देववत् स्यादुपास्यः”

To the question ‘How can he be equal to God?’ he expounds in the following way. This is because, God gives instructions through an *ācārya* so, an *ācārya* is not different from God. Similarly, he blocks the student’s darkness of divine Knowledge, he absolves the sins of the student, he shows the student identify with the \(divine\) of soul and the Supreme being \(*ātmasāmya*\), he transforms the life of ignorance of the divine and grants the life of divine knowledge, he is endowed with divine vision \(*divyadṛshṭi*\), he causes the flow of kindness without hindrances, he possesses the requisite sentiment \(*niyata-rasa*\), he is united with the Eternal Being \(*śeshi*\).

> अज्ञानध्वान्तरोधादघपरिहरणादात्मसाम्यावहत्वात्   
> जन्मप्रध्वंसिजन्मप्रदगरिमतया दिव्यदृष्टिप्रभावात् ।   
> निष्प्रत्यूहानृशंस्यान्नियतरसतया नित्यशेषित्वयोगात्   
> आचार्यस्सद्भिरप्रत्युपकरणधिया देववत् स्यादुपास्यः ॥ 

*Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavadpāda* teaches the attributes of a *Guru* in a similar view and expresses:

“He should be well versed in the revealed knowledge \(*Śrotriya*\), sinless, he should not be captivated by cupid’s attacks, he should be the best among the \[*veda*\] philosophers \(*brahmavit*\), he should be retired in the Supreme Being \(*parabrahma*\), he should be peaceful like the fire without firewood, he should be resplendent \(exude brilliance *tejasvī*\)”

Those who understand the meaning of the phonemes of the word \(*śabda*\) *Guru*, define *Guru* as the one who unties the knot of ignorance of the divine \(*avidyā*\).

> श्रोत्रियोवृजिनोकामहतो यो ब्रह्मवित्तमः ।   
> ब्रह्मण्युपरतश्शान्तः निरिन्धन इवानलः ।   
> अविद्याहृदयग्रैन्थिबन्धमोक्षो भवेद्यतः।   
> तमेव गुरुरित्याहुः गुरुशब्दार्थवेदिनः॥   
“आचार्यादिह देवतां समधिकामन्यां न मन्यामहे 

\(We do not know any God other than the *Guru*\). *Guru* is *Brahma, Vishṇu, Śiva* embodiment. *Guru* is the very Supreme Being \(*parabrahma*\) perceived by the external eyes. Even if God gets angry \[at the student\] *Guru* pacifies God and protects the disciple. If *Guru* gets angry then no one can protect the disciple.

हरौ \(शिवे\) रुष्टे गुरुस्त्राता गुरौ रुष्टे न कश्चन”

*‘Guru’* is ‘Hari’ in the form of a human being, icon in the image of *parabrahma* with attributes. However abundant may be the knowledge of the religious canons, knowledge of time, fame, fortune, worship, they are all useless, if the mind does not cling to the lotus feet of the *Guru*.

> मनश्चेन्नलग्नं गुरोरङ्घ्‌रिपद्मे   
> ततः किं ततः किं ततः किं ततः कि? \(गुर्वष्टक\) 

*“Guruvina gulāmanāguva tanaka doreyadṇṇa mukuti” \(Śrī Purandara dāsaru\)*

Emancipation will not be attained, until one becomes *Guru’*s slave.

“One who possesses immense devotion toward God, and possesses, just as much and, similar divine love toward *Guru*, only to that great soul, will the meaning of these Upanishads be elucidating”

> यस्य देवे पराभकिः यथा देवे तथा गुरौ ।   
> तस्यैते कथिता ह्यर्थाः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मनाम् ॥ \(कठोपनिषत्\) 

**We can reminisce, here, *Śrī Raṅgamahāguru’s* elucidating words, about the *Śrī Guru*. “Guru is God’s vehicle; Guru is not a person, but is a treasury of divine knowledge we have to keep that vessel within us and experience that which is inside that vessel**. The abode which eliminates ignorance is *Guru”*. *“Guru*, although weighty, is a raft or a ship which does not itself sink, but transports hundreds of people. Just as a conducting medium is needed for the flow of electrical energy, so also, a divine descent *Guru* is needed for the flow of energy of *Guru* God, to a living being”. Do not ridicule uttering ‘does *Guru* have horns? \(as a mark of greatness\), *Guru* is also a man’. He is a unicorn boar carrier of sacrificial fire, four horned embodiment of *praṇava* \(*Oṅkāra*\). Notice when we write the word *“Guru’* in sanskrit\) there are two horns. Should we remove those horns the word *Guru* become *gara* which means poison”. A match stick’s greatness is because of the phosphor it possesses, not because of the mere stick. The greatness is not of the person , but it is of the person’s power \(of knowledge\). For greatness to manifest conjoining of some thing is needed. If there is *Guru*, student and God’s union, then only that greatness is realized.”

“In the view of grammar, the phoneme *Guru*, conveys an orator of dharma and divine knowledge, one who swallows \(student’s\) ignorance. \(*gṛśabde, gṛnigaraṇe;*\)”.

In our scriptures, we see thousands of proclamations which extol greatness of the preceptor *Śrī Guru*. These proclamations are not empty praises. According to the adepts, they are factual and can actually be experienced, in person. But, these apply to the *Guru*, who is a firmly established spiritualist \(*Brahma nishṭha*\). The word spiritualist means “one who has personally experienced Sprit in its true form “साक्षात्कृतपरमपुरुषस्वरूपः गुरुः” \(*Śrī Rāmānuja’s vedānta dīpa*\).

There is nothing improper in celebrating the auspicious time of births \(*janma dina*\) ofvirtuous people, adorned with these attributes, feeling they are Gods.

The birthdays \(*janma dina*\) or auspicious lunar calendar days of death \(*tithi*\) of these great soul are thought of as auspicious as the auspicious time of incarnations of God and so, they are celebrated as sacred religious days \(*utsava*\). We will discuss some of the famous *utsava* days.

***Vardhantī; jayantī:*** The auspicious birth day of *Śrī Madācārya* is termed as either *vardhantī* or *jayantī*. The tradition of addressing birth times of an *ācārya* when they adorn the earth, alive, as *vardhantī* and when they are no longer physically present, as *jayantī* is found in Karnataka state. However the term *vardhantī* is not found in the scriptures. And, that word cannot be readily derived grammatically. It might have come into practice by adaptation of the word *jayantī*. The term *vardhantī* is fashioned to mean that an *ācārya’*s lifetime has progressed to the present time, and it should progress well into future. The term *jayantī*, as we have observed earlier, is used to mean a day which expands spiritual victory and merit. \(“जयं पुण्यं च तनुते जयन्तीं तेन तां विदुः”\) These attributes of applies to the birth day when an *ācārya* is alive, as well. And, so, such a day could also without blemish be termed *jayantī*. The term *vardhantī* is also called vardhāpana celebration \(which means, a ceremony in commemoration of cutting the umbilical cord\).

***Nakshatra, tithi:*** Should the sacred birthday of *ācārya* be observed on the birth star constellation or the lunar day of birth? Both of these are scripturally sound. Should both these events occur at the same time, there is no doubt such a time is the most auspicious time for the celebration. If not, we observe, the commemoration is celebrated on the day of the birth star constellation, as *tiru-nakshatra* \(*Śrī Nakshatra*\). The celebrations based only on the lunar day of birth is also found in the tradition. We observe, that the scriptures say, the *Nakshatra* is eightfold more propitious than the lunar day \(“तिथिरेकगुणा प्रोक्ता नक्षत्रोऽटगुणः स्मृतः”\) The *śānti* \(pacification\) is only performed for birth star and not for birth day. So, the argument that it is more appropriate to celebrate birth star than the birthday, is correct. However, since the scriptures use terms such as *Rāma Navamī*, *Kṛshṇāshṭamī*, with regard to divine incarnations, the birthday celebrations based on the lunar day of birth \(*tithi*\) are also, wholly effective. The experiences of the realized adepts highlight the importance of these two celestial events. We find the birth star is prominent in Tamil Nadu, and the lunar birthday is prominent, elsewhere.

When an *ācārya* transits from the earth heavenward \(*parama pada*\), the lunar day, is primarily used, for commemoration. There is no difference among different customs in this regard. Since the annual reverential homage for the departed is lunar day based, that homage ceremony itself is termed *tithi* by the common people. Such a day for an *ācārya* is termed sacred lunar day \(*puṇya tithi*\)

### Birthdays of a few principal *ācārya*s:

1\) In the lineage of *ācārya’*s, the foremost and which is beyond the bounds of time, is Almighty God. So, \(*pātañjala yoga śāstra*\) *Patañjali’s* treatise on *yoga* views Him as , “He is the *Guru* for all the prior *Guru’*s. Because, He is beyond the limitation of time”. “पूर्वेषामपि स गुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात् ”

The first *Guru* in the lineage of *Guru’*s is God himself, says, *Venkaṭanātha*. \(“आद्यं गुरुं गुरुपरम्परयाधिगम्यम्”\) Also, the incarnation of *Śrī Nārāyaṇa*, and *Gītācārya Kṛshṇa’*s *Śrī jayantī* has been discussed earlier.

2\) The principal *ācārya* after *Gītācārya Kṛshṇa* is *vedavyāsa* venerated by all. \(मुनीनामप्यहं व्यासः\) Lord *Kṛshṇa* himself extols the adeptness of *Vedavyāsa*, proclaiming “I am *Vedavyāsa* among *muni’s”*. *Kṛshṇa, Dvaipāyana, Kṛshṇadvaipāyana, Parāsharya, Bādarāyaṇa, Vyāsa, Vedavyāsa* are all considered to be the incarnations of God. \(Some argue *Vedavyāsa* and *Bādarāyaṇa* are two different person. However, the traditional view that they are one and the same, is agreeable for us, as well\). “कृष्णद्वैपायनं विद्धि साक्षान्नारायणं नृप” These great *Guru*s, who have enriched, *Sanātana Ārya Bhāratīya* culture, by, categorization of *veda*, authoring *Mahābhārata*, authoring or compiling *purāṇa* epics, authoring *vedānta* \(*Brahma*\) *sūtra* and authoring other noble poetic works, are venerated by all other *Guru*s of later times.

These *ācāryas* are especially worshipped at the commencement and at the culmination of *cāturmāsya* \(four months, from full moon day in *āshāḍha* month to full moonday of *Kārtīka* month is called *cāturmāsa*. This is the period in which the wandering ascetics are in deep meditation, at one place\). The full moon day in *āshāḍha* month is famously named as *Vyāsapūrṇima*. On that day, together with the four *Śishyas, Paila, Vaiśampāyana, Jaimini* and *Sumantu* and his own son of divine knowledge *śukabrahmarshi*, the venerable *Vedavyāsa* and the all of the *ācāryas* who authored exposition of *Brahma sūtra \(bhāshya\)* are specially worshipped by the ascetics.

3\) *Śrī Mahāvīra* and *Śrī Buddha* are also *ācārya*s who have immensely helped the *ārya* culture. *Śrī Mahāvīra vradhamānasvāmī* is the founder of *Jaina* doctrine \(*mata*\). *Gautama Buddha* is the founder of *bauddha* doctrine. Both of them are generally being viewed as founders of non-vedic doctrines. **But, Śrī Raṅga Guru used to say with high regard: “They are great teachers who attained direct knowledge, without resorting to canons of scriptures.** And, on that basis, founded their doctrines, and preached the qualities of the soul \(*Ātma guṇa*\) which are taught in *vaidika* doctrine such as compassion toward all creatures and nonviolence. They are not opponents of vedic religious path but, they stressed portions of the vedic religious path.”

***Vradhamānamahāvīra***, the 24th head titled ***tīrthaṅkara***, in ***jaina*** lineage, \(*tīrthaṅkara* literally means one creates fords\) was famously known as *sanmati, jina*. His time was 599-527 BCE. His birthday is celebrated on the thirteenth day of bright fortnight of *Caitramāsa*. Known by famous names *Śākya muni, siddhārtha* etc, *Gautama Buddha’s* time was around 563-643 BCE. His birthday and the realization days are both on the full moon day of the month *vaiśākha*. So, his birthday is celebrated on the same full moon day of the *vaiśākha* month.

There are eight *ācārya*s who were famous among those who wrote expositions for *Bādarāyaṇa’s Brahma sūtra*.

+ *Śrī Śaṅkarācārya* \(CE 788-820\) 
+ *Śrī Bhāskarācārya* \(later half of tenth century\) 
+ *Śrī Yādava prakāśa* \(later half of tenth century\) 
+ *Śrī Rāmānujacārya* \( CE 1017-1126\) 
+ *Śrī Madhvācārya* \(CE 1238-1317\) 
+ *Śrī Nimbārkācārya* \(later half of 13th century\) 
+ *Śrī Śrīkaṅṭhācārya* \(later half of 13th century\) 
+ *Śrī Vallabhācārya* \(CE 1479-1531\) 

Out of these eight *ācārya*s *Śrī Śaṅkarācārya*, *Śrī Rāmānujacārya*, and *Śrī Madhvācārya* are relatively more famous than others. Among these three *Śaṅkara Bhagavatpāda* is the first one. He wrote expositions of the three canonical texts \(*prasthāna traya*\), namely *upanishad*, *Brahma sūtra*, and *Bhagavad Gīta* on behalf of non-attributive monoism \(*nirviśesha advaita*\) and played the bugle of *vedānta*. He presented to the world, treatises enlightening the *jnāna* \(knowledge of truth\), the essence of devotion \(*bhakti*\), the shining treatises of expositions and elaborations, decorated with poetic fragrance, and treatise of prayer hymns \(*stotra*\). His *jayanti* is on fifth day of the *vaiśāka* month. The king of ascetics, *bhaghavad Rāmānujacārya* wrote expositions of *upanishad*, *Brahma sūtra*, and *Bhagavad gīta* on behalf of attributive monoism \(*saviśesha advaita*\). This elite *ācārya* established his doctrine, by authoring treatises enlightening the *jnāna*, the essence of devotion \(*bhakti*\), the expositions, decorated with renunciation fragrance, and treatise of prayer hymns \(*stotra*\) and daily rites \(*Āhnika*\) and by proving the authenticity of external worship \(*āgama śāstra*\) and thereby reviving the temple culture. His *jayantī* is on *Ārdrā Nakshatra* constellation in the month of *Mesha*. *Śrī Śankara* and The *jayantīs Śrī Rāmānuja* fall on the same day or within a day difference.

The great *ācārya*, who wrote exposition for he three canonical texts, \(*prasthāna traya*\) in the view of dualism, and caused the stream of devotion to flow, in *Bhārata* is *Śrī Madhvācāraya*. He was also famously known as *Śrī Ānandatīrtha, Pūrṇaprajna* and other names. The greatness of being the source of inspiration for *Śrī Purandaradāsa* and others of the *Hari-dāsa* lineage of Karnataka belongs to this *ācārya*. His sacred birthday is on the ninth day of bright fortnight of the month of *māgha. \(makara\)*

*Śrī Basaveśvara*, the treasure house of divine devotion who revived the *Vīra Śaiva* doctrine, was born eight hundred years ago. This great man, wrote poetry with divine devotion, deep thought, simplicity, elegant illustrations and simile, in pleasing style. He attracted people to follow the noble path of life, with his poetry and his exemplary simple living style with purity. His birthday is celebrated on the first day of the bright fortnight of the month, *Vṛshabha \(vaiśākha\)*.

On the birth days \(*jayantī*\) of the *ācārya*s, ceremonial recitation of their expositions, ritual worship, prayers and singing are performed. Their icons are carried in procession. Feasting and fasting rituals are also followed.

On the auspicious lunar days, similar celebrations are performed. But, they are prominently meditative celebrations. Those who follow *veda*s \(*Śrotriyas*, invoke these *ācāryas* and worship them and partake the foods offered to them.

Although there are differences in their articulation of the essences, the *ācāryas* representetives of *Sanātana Ārya Bhāratīya* culture have guided people at large by their lives and compositions, and the message “there is the divine principle, with virtuous conduct, and with the wealth of virtues of the soul, devotion and realization, the noblest emancipation has to be achieved”. So, they are adorable for everyone.

Do the birthday of the realized masters are beneficially influence every one? or beneficially influence only their followers? If these are reincarnations of the divine, their birth days are beneficial to all. Otherwise, their like natured disciples are especially benefitted by inspiration. However, form their life and message and compositions every one can be inspired.





	 
## Śrī Kṛshṇa Jayantī—Janmāshṭamī

*Śrī KṛshṇaJayantī* or *Janmāshṭamī* is a very important festival, which comes in the month of *srāvaṇa*. People call it by different names such as *Gokulāshṭamī*, *Jayantī*, *Śrī Jayantī* etc. It is a great festival observed all over India with joy and devotion. It is a very popular, sacred and very auspicious *parva* which is observed by people belonging to all *varṇas*, *āśramas* and classes. *Śrī Kṛshṇa* is the deity worshipped specially on that day. In this background it is necessary to know a little about the reigning deity of this festival.

“Who is this *Kṛshṇa*? Why should we worship him? Some may ask. “Don’t we know *Kṛshṇa*? He is *Paramātma* himself. Don’t the *Sādhus* and saints call him by the name *KṛshṇaParamātma*? He is the ninth *avatāra* of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. His *avatāra* is the nearest of all the *avatāras* to us. It is the best and the most dear of all the incarnations. Though he is considered an *avatāra*, he is the Lord Himself “कृष्णस्तु भगवान् स्वयम्” “ईश्वरः परमः कृष्णः” More than being termed a mere *avatāra*, he is known as the *Sadānanda Parañjyoti* who incarnated in ten forms such as *Matsya*, *Kūrma* etc and praised as the *Ādipurusha*, *Parabrahma* and *Purushottama* by his devotees.

“दशाकृतिकृते कृष्णाय तुभ्यं नमः” Is he not the Lord who is heartfully praised in *Śṛutis, Smṛtis, Itihāsas, Purāṇas, Kāvyas* and *Prabandhas* by *Maharshis, Mahābhāgavata Ālvārs, ācāryas*, great *dāsas*, poets and *Kīrtanakārās*? He is not a mere god but is the God of all gods.

“तं देवतानां परमं च दैवतम्” He incarnated on this earth in the human form to protect the *Dharmasetu* \(which connects the world and God\). Though he conducted himself as an ordinary human being, he is the *paramapurusha* who very clearly demonstrated His unequalled power, invaluable wisdom, wealth, vigour, valour, effulgence and *Ātmaguṇas* during crucial times. He was, a repository of *Jnāna* and compassion, an extremely handsome person, a great artist, the directorn of *Mahābhārata*, *Mahādhīradhaureya*, \(the foremost among the bravest\), Lord of *Dharma*, a kin of the righteous *Pānḍavās*, a friend, a minister, an emissary, and an adept in the four *upāyas* who elevated not just the wise and the excellent humans, but also cows, cowherds, beasts, birds, trees and *vanaspatis*. He was a politician, a scholar, a capable person, a divine human non—pareil who accepted the first worship from the pious *Pānḍavās* on the directions of *Bhīshma* in the assembly of all the revered, a *yogacārya* who in the role of a charioteer of *Arjuna* and in the pretext of enlightening him, taught *Gīta* the crest jewel of all spiritual texts to help the three worlds. So is it justified if Indians ask “who this *Kṛshṇa* is and why should he be worshipped, when he is renowned both in *Loka* and *Veda* as one brighter than the day time sun?”—Some may say.

But, now—a—days, more and more people are seen lacking in the above said devotion and wisdom. Only people who have no discipline and enlightenment, and who happen to be under the influence of faulty education are found everywhere in our country. No wonder they ask such questions. They might have a little knowledge of the literature pertaining to *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. They could be living amidst those who worship *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. Even then, as they don’t have any regard towards *ŚrīKṛshṇa,* they ask question like “Who is he? Why should he be worshipped” etc.

Several kinds of questions pertaining to *ŚrīKṛshṇa* invade and confront the minds of many people. They have been subjected to the influence of various bewildering literatures, lectures and propaganda.

A modern scholar in his foreward to the kannada translation of *Potana’sBhagavata* writes: The name *“Kṛshṇa”* appears in the *Ṛgveda*. In that text he is an *asura*. What does his life indicate there? *Āryans* tried to impose their *dharma,* culture and civilization on the natives of this land and called them *dasyus,* when they refused to yield. They fought with them and looted their wealth. *Kṛshṇa* was prominent among those who fought them. He died. Indra fleeced *Kṛshṇa* and killed his followers and his wives, says the text. The object was to obliterate that very race. This happened long ago. In the course of time *Kṛshṇa* emerged as an honourable person. He became a martyr. *Āryans* began to respect the culture of the natives, and as the two cultures got blended, *Kṛshṇa’*s fame started escalating. By the time of the *Purāṇas* he came to be considered an *avatārapurusha*.”

*“ŚrīKṛshṇa* preaches *dharma* and life values in the *Bhagavadgīta*. But we find in the *Mahābhārata* that during the war, he taught deceptive strategies to the *Pānḍavās* many times, to kill the enemies. Therefore it seems, these two *Kṛshṇas* must be two different persons. In course of time, these two were taken to be one.”—comments a western scholar in his History of Indian literature.

Some critics say - “We see a flute in the hands of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, in pictures and idols. He must be from South India. Because, he places the flute on his lip horizontally and plays on it. In the north, it is played vertically like the *nāgasvara*. The *Kṛshṇa* of north India is a *Kshatriya*. Whereas the *Kṛshṇa* of the South is a cowherd. The *Kṛshṇa* of the north was born in *Mathurā* near Delhi, and the *Kṛshṇa* of the South was born in *Madhurā*, in deep south

According to another theory, the name *Kṛshṇa* is the corrupt form of the word Krista \(Christ\) and some Indian scholars included Jesus Christ’s own teachings in the *BhagavadGīta* in the Christian era.

They support this theory saying that many playful acts of child *ŚrīKṛshṇa* narrated in the *Bhāgavata* are similar to those of Christ’s appearing in the Bible.

Many people sermon amends as follows:—

“Long ago *Kṛshṇa* preached the *Gīta* and the same son of God appeared as Christ and preached the religion of Christianity as told in the Bible. People of ancient days needed *Kṛshṇa’s* preachings. We should follow the *Dharma* taught by him, who came to be born as Christ to suit the needs of the present day people. Therefore we celebrate car festivals of Christ in churches on *Kṛshṇa Jayanti*. All of you must to come and participate in this and become holy.”

There is an argument which says

“The one who preached the *Gīta* in the *Mahābhārata* is the *Yogirāja Kṛshṇa*, the ideal person. But the person referred to as *‘Gopīvallabha’* \(the dear Lord of the Gopis\) and *Jāra Chora Śikhāmaṇi* \(The best of libertines and thieves\) in the *Purāṇas* is just an imaginary character and not a historical person at all.”

*“ŚrīKṛshṇa* is no god. It is not correct to say that he is a role model. Because how can stealing butter be an ideal to children? Our children may ask “If he can steal butter why can’t we steal pencils?” The way he behaved with *Gopīs* substantiates the point that he is an immoral person and deserves to be punished. And the ethics he teaches the *Pānḍavās* is still atrocious. Non—violence is the essence of *Dharma*. Sacrifice and harmony happen to be the gist of Social *Dharma*. But what *Kṛshṇa* taught the *Pānḍavās* is the *dharma* of war which caused total destruction. How can he, who fostered a divide between *Pānḍavās* and *Kauravās* who should have coexisted like brothers, he who taught a violent polity that instigates a war and a deceptive strategy to attain victory over the enemies unethically in many situations, be an ideal person?”—propaganda with this purport are also being heard.

*“ŚrīKṛshṇa* is an arrogant person. He lacks humility. He has no devotion to God because in his sermons to *Arjuna* and says “I am the supreme God myself. Surrender unto me. I will redeem you of all the sins” - we come across criticisms like this also.

Objecting to the worship of *Kṛshṇa* some say “How can one be a *yogi*, who, not content with marrying eight queens, goes to marry sixteen thousand women? How can we be redeemed of our sins by worshipping such a person?”

“Whatever may be *ŚrīKṛshṇa* - a righteous person, a wicked man, or a man of mixed dispositions, he can never be a God. A \(mere\) leader among men, he was elevated to Godhood by the sentiments of people”-Some conclude this way also.

A character by name *‘Kṛshṇa Āṅgīrasa’* appears in the *Ṛgveda*. He was a poet and a devotee of the *Ashviṇī devatās*.

> अयं वां कृष्णो अश्विनाहवते वाजिनीवसू मध्वः सोमस्य पीतये   
> शृणुतं जरितुर्हवं कृष्णस्य स्तुवतो नरा ।   
> मध्वः सोमस्य पीतये ॥ \(ऋग्वेद XIII 85 3-4\) 

The same sage poet sings the praise of *Ashviṇī devatās* in *Sūktas* 86 and 87. This very sage might have been considered as God in *Mahābhārata* and later times”—This is another conjecture.

In the *ChandogyaUpanishad* there is a reference \(III-16\) to a character by name *Ghora Āngīrasa* who is a sage and who taught *Kṛshṇa* the son of *Devakī* the *Purusha Vidyā* and, as a result, *Kṛshṇa* lost interest in all the other branches of learning.

“तद्धैतत् घोरआङ्गीरसः कृष्णाय देवकीपुत्रायेत्युक्त्वाचापिपास एव स बभूव” Is yet another opinion on *Kṛshṇa*. “This very same disciple of *Ghora Āngīrasa* is *Kṛshṇa* whom we come across in the *Mahābhārata* and other *Purāṇās”* say some some scholars. The *Kṛshṇa* of this *Upanishad* is a sage, like the *Kṛshṇa* we find in the *Rgveda*. He belonged to the *gotra* of a sage by name *Angirāh* and was his disciple also. He is not the Lord *Kṛshṇa* who appears in the *Purāṇas* because the *Kṛshṇa* of the *Ṛgved*a calls himself a *vipra* \(a Brahmin\)

> “तर्धिर्यन्तमदाभ्यं विप्राय स्तुवते नरा” 

On the other hand, the *Kṛshṇa* of the *Purāṇas* and *itihāsas* was a *Kshatriya*.:- This is an opposite opinion.

When such view points invade our mind, it is natural that some questions like—“Who is the *Śrī Kṛshṇa* whom we are supposed to worship on *Kṛshṇajayanti*? A human being? a god? Or a historical person? Or a personage in poetical compositions? There could be hundreds of *Kṛshṇas* in history. Who among them is this *ŚrīKṛshṇa*? If he possesses such unideal qualities, he can never be considered even as a revered human being. How can such a person be regarded as god? Why should he be worshipped at all?” Unless an answer that satisfies our mind is obtained, one many cherish no interest in the celebration of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayanti*. So, we wish to put forth the answers to these questions:

1. “The first argument against the divinity of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* runs on the following lines:—

“According to a *mantra* in the *Ṛgveda Śrī Kṛshṇa* was an *asura* who was an opponent of *Ārya Dharma*. He was a great leader of the *Drāviḍas*. *Indra* fleeced him and slaughtered all the members of his family. His name merely remained in the Dravidan folk stories and songs for a long time, and later this *drāviḍa dasyu* leader came to be respected by the *Āryans* also. He is not just a human being; he is an incarnation of *Mahāvishṇu*. He is the God of Gods who gained renown after defeating *Indra”*-This is the first argument.

		
This argument is based a dishonest imagination. The person who put forward this argument has not explained the related *mantra* and its meaning. He has not made a full study of the *Ṛgveda* and the references to the name *Kṛshṇa* in different context in that. He has not even stated where the *Asurakṛshṇa* mentioned by him figures in the stories and songs in the intermediate times. And as this argument has been put forth by the brainchildren of proselytizers, who, with the intention of creating a rift in the *Bhāratīya* Culture preached that all *Drāviḍians* are *Dasyus*, the *Āryans* whose culture was just ordinary, vanquished the highly cultured people, and later the conflict between the two cultures culminated in the harmony of the two cultures.

We have references to *AsuraKṛshṇa* in the *Ṛgveda*. In the same way *Mantrarshi Kṛshṇa* is also referred to there. But neither of the two is *ŚrīKṛshṇaVāsudeva*. The *Kṛshṇa* killed by *Devendra* was an enemy of the *Devās,* a *dasyu* and an enemy of *Vaidika dharma*. He belongs to the category of *Vṛtra*, *Namuci*, *Śambara*, *Vala* etc. He is a demon having the form of a black snake. He is a *tamoguṇi*. But the one whom we worship as *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is the protector of *Vaidika Dharma*. He stood as a supporter of the *Vaidika Yajnas* such as *Rājasūya* and *Aśvamedha,* and saw them completed. He adorned the *Kshatriya* class. He was a natural friend of *Indra*, though he broke the latter’s arrogance in the episodes such as *Govardhana Pūja*, *Khānḍavadahana* and *Pārījātāpaharaṇa*. He killed *Narakāsura* the enemy of the *devas*, and restored to them their wealth. He killed *Kamsa, Kālayavana, mura* and a number of demons, and protected *Indra’s* status and prestige. He was bosom friend of *Arjuna* the son of *Indra*. He subdued the serpent *Kāliṅga*. He was the protector of Brahmins and cows, he was *Yajnarūpa*, and *Yajnasamārādhya*. \(the adored deity in the *Yajnas*\).

\(“यज्ञो वै विष्णुः “यज्ञेन यज्ञमयजन्त देवाः”\) He is considered an incarnation of *Upendra*, who was the younger brother and a friend of *Devendra*. Thus, he is quite the opposite of *dasyubhāva*, in all respects viz, birth, qualities, deeds and nature. And equating *ŚrīKṛshṇaPramātma* with the *Ṛgvedic* demon *Kṛshṇa* is a great thoughtless action. We have to crown this person with inverted intelligence with the title of a moron, who has \(tried to\) affix the title of a *Daityā* to the *“Daityāri”* \(The enemy of demons\) He has conjured up a strange argument, which is just based on the similarity in the name *Kṛshṇa*. In the *Purāṇas* we come across a *daitya* by name *Hayagrīva*, and, an incarnation of *Mahāvishṇu* who killed him is also known by that name. Some people, without studying the full details of the story get misled by the similarity of names and argue that *Hayagrīva* who was a demon in the past, became the worshipful God *Hayagrīva* in the later times. We think both these expounders were fostered in the same cattleshed. The argument that all the *drāviḍas* are *dasyus* is also baseless. Some say that this is an argument climber, which has grown in the farm of the minds of those who wish to create rifts in the adorers of *Āryasamskṛti* which is one whole entity. We feel that these are webs of imaginations having no basis in *śāstras*, traditions and reasoning.

2. “The *Asura Kṛshṇa* referred to in the *Ṛgveda* may not be *ŚrīKṛshṇaparamātma*; But the devotee of *Aśvinī devatās* mentioned in the eighth *Maṇḍala* \(*Sūkta* 85-3\) could be *ŚrīKṛshṇa Paramātma”*—say some. “अयं वा कृष्णो अश्विनाहवतो वाजिनीवसू मध्वः सोमस्य पीतये” The above said is one by name *Kṛshṇa*, a *Mantradrashṭāra Kavi Maharshi;* and there is no doubt about it. But he may not be our *Kṛshṇaparamātma*. This is because the *Mantradrashṭā*ra *ṛshi* calls himself a *“vipra”* \(a Brahmin\)

“वुर्दिर्यन्तमदा विप्राय स्तुवते सदा”—*ŚrīKṛshṇa* the famous historical personage is a *kshatriya*. Even if the word *Vipra* is interpreted to mean *“Medhāvī”* \(highly intelligent,\) it is unusual that this *mantra drashtāra* calls himself *Medhāvi* while praising the *Aśvinī devas*. And in the next *sūkta*, the *Ṛshi* is said to be one *“Viśvaka”*, the son of *Kṛshṇa*. There is no reference in any *Itihāsa Purāṇa* or *Āgama* that *ŚrīKṛshṇa Paramātma* had a son by that name and he was a *Mantradrashṭāra*.

There is no reference to prove that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was a *Ṛshi* who was the *drashṭā* \(seer\) of *Ashvinīmantra* stated above. But the *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas* state clearly that he is the incarnation of *Ṛshi Nārāyaṇa* the friend of *Nara,* and who is famous as the *Drashṭāra* of *Purushasūkta* and *Ashṭāksharamahāmantras*.

“नरनारायणावेतौ पुराणावृषिसत्तमौ” 

*Vedas* call the almighty who performs the *yajnas* of the creation, sustenance and the destruction of the universe, a *Ṛshi*.

> य इमा विश्वा भुवनानि जुह्व्दृषिर्होता निषसादा पिता नः \(विश्वकर्मसूक्त तै. सं. IV-6-2\) 

In this sense also *Bhagavān Śrī Kṛshṇa* can be called a *Ṛshi*.

3. In the *Chāndogya Upanishad* \(III-16\) there is a statement which purports that a *Maharshi* by name *Ghora Āngīrasa,* initiated *ŚrīKṛshṇa* the son of *Devaki* to the *Prāṇavidya* “तद्धैतत् घोरआङ्गिरसः कृष्णाय देवकीपुत्राय उक्त्वा उवाचापिपास एव स बभूव”

Some guess that the above said son of *Devaki* could be *Bhagavān ŚrīKrish* na the famous historic personality. There is scope to imagine that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* had the *Upadeśa* of *Prāṇavidya* from this *Ghora Āngīrasa* just as he underwent training in the *Vedaśāstras* and arms and missiles, in the *Gurukula* of *Maharshi* such as *Sāndīpini*. It gains support from the present statement that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is the son of *Devakī*. But nowhere in the *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas* the name of the same *Ghora Āngīrasa* has appeared although the names of *Sāndīpini*, *Garga*, *Upamanyu* etc are mentioned as *Ācāryas* of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. Further *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is an *Ātreya* and not an *Āngīrasa*.

The *Kṛshṇa* who is the *Drashṭāra* of *Mantras* pertaining to *Ashvini—Devatās* appearing in the *Ṛgveda* may be the same *Kṛshṇa* referred to in this *Upanishad*. Because, both of them belong to the group of disciples who belong to the *Āngīrasa Gotra*. Even if we look into the fact that the philosophy preached by *ŚrīKṛshṇa* in the *Mahābhārata* is much deeper than the philosophy preached by *Ghora Āngīrasa*, we have to come to the conclusion that *Bhagavan Śrī Kṛshṇa* is different from *Ghora Āngīrasa*. It is possible that the names of the mothers of the two may have been *Devakī* by sheer coincidence, and that does not mean that we should conclude that the two are one and the same. We find in the *Mahābhārata* and the *Bhāgavata* that a king of *Pounḍraka* country whose fathers’ name was *Vāsudeva*, claimed that he himself was the \(genuine\) *Vasudeva* and had challenged *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. Though both of them were the sons of *Vasudeva* namewise, they were in reality, two different persons.

\(Some commentators have in their *Bhāshya* on the above sentence of the *Chāndogyopanishat* state that *Ghora Āngīrasa Maharshi* offered *Prāṇavidya* to *ŚrīKṛshṇa* the son of *Devakī* and attained *moksha* after practicing it. But some critics say that this stands to be regarded as *Adhyāhāra* \(ellipse\) and *Lakshaṇā* \(an indirect application of a word\) in the above said commentary.

In the *Nārāyaṇa Upanishad*, we see the words “ब्रह्मण्यो देवकीपुत्रो ब्रह्मण्यो मधुसूदनोम्” in praise of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. There is no doubt that this *Nārāyaṇa* is *Śrī Kṛshṇa Paramātma* himself. In the *Vishṇu Gāyatrī* of the *Yājnikī Upanishad*, we find the word *Vāsudeva*.

> “नारायणाय विद्महे वासुदेवाय धीमहि” 

*Kṛshṇa* or *Vāsudeva* is none else than the incarnation of this *Paravāsudeva*. A king by name *Paunḍraka Vāsudeva,* claiming himself to be the real incarnation of *Paravāsudeva*, and sporting the costumes of *Vāsudeva Nārāyaṇa*, challenges *Śrī Kṛshṇa Vāsudeva* for a battle. So, it becomes clear that the custom of worshipping *Nārāyaṇa* with the name *Vāsudeva* existed, even before *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* time.

> वासनाद्वासुदेवस्य वासितं ते जगच्रयम्’|   
> सर्वभूतनिवासोऽसि वासुदेव नमोऽस्तु ते॥ 

If so who is this *Kṛshṇa* whom the *Śāstras* and traditions call an incarnation? Is he a human being or a God? To this, we wish to say that he is God himelf, who appeared in the human form, like *ŚrīRāmacandra*.

We have dealt in detail about this concept of *avatāra* in the chapter of *ŚrīRāmanavamī*. In the *Rāmāvatāra*, God has concealed his *Parasvarūpa* to a great extent. But in the *Kṛshṇāvatāra* he clearly proclaims it on several occasions. And it can be noted that he has demonstrated it \(that he is *Paramātma*\) on several occasions also. But in his times also, there were laymen, who, not knowing his *Parasvarūpa* slighted and despised him, taking him to be a mere human being.

> “अवजानन्ति मां मूढाः मानुषीं तनुमाश्रितम्” 

**“Both *ŚrīRāma* and *ŚrīKṛshṇa* are special incarnations of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. But in the *Kṛshṇāvatāra* the display of *Parasvarūpa* is more” was the divine remark of *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru*. Of *Rāma* he had said—“To the external eye he is a human, but to the internal eye he is divine \(*Upendra*\) and to the spiritual eye he is the *Paramātma*,” and we think the same applies to *ŚrīKṛshṇa* also.**

> “गूढं परं ब्रह्म मनुष्यलिङ्गम्” 

Winternitz \(A German Indologist\) surmises that the *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who preached the *Gīta* to *Arjuna* and the *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who taught the war strategy to the *Pāṇḍavās* were two different personalities, because, he feels, that the *Gīta* upholds spirituality and righteousness. He thinks that the *Kṛshṇa* who prached the *Gīta* and the *Kṛshṇa* who provided deceitful tips to *Pāṇḍavas* on many occasions and caused the decimation of lakhs of people in the great war, could not be one and the same.

But if one makes an evaluation of the entire story of *Mahābhārata*, this argument does not hold water. Because, *Śrī Kṛshṇa,* keeping spirituality as the central point in the *Gīta*, instructs *Arjuna* the greatest *Kshatriya* that killing wicked enemies in the battle is indeed his *Dharma*. He does not provoke the *Pāṇḍavas* to wage a war against the *Kauravas*. The *Pānḍavas* make every effort to stop the war. “It is sufficient even if only five villages are given to the *Pāṇḍavās*. They shall not fight”—is the concession shown by *Kṛshṇa*. “I have come here to beg you to see that these great *kshatriyas* are not oblitereated. Let both *Pāṇḍavās* and *Kauravas*, like the Lion and the forest, remain mutually protective.”—This is the request made by *Śrī Kṛshṇa* to *Dhṛtarāshṭra* in the great assembly on behalf of the *Pāṇḍavas*. But the arrogant, wicked and the deceitful *Duryodhana* says“—Without waging a war, I shall not give even a needletip of land to the *Pānḍavās*.” “सूच्यग्रं नैव दास्यामि विना युद्धेन” and so the *Pānḍavās* having no other go are forced to descend to the battlefield. It is not fair to accuse *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as the one who loved war, and as one who is responsible for the war which brought about great disasters, by causing a rift between *Kaurava* and *Pāṇḍavās*.

Now, about *Kṛshṇa* instructing the *Pānḍavās* to adopt unfair means in the war. As *Kauravās* resorted to deceitful means frequently, *Kṛshṇa* had to advise the *Pānḍavās* to pay the enemy back with the same coin. ‘The deception of the deceivers should be vanquished by deceipt only—

> “मायाविन इमां मायां मायया जहि पार्थिव” 

It is not polity to extend uprightness to crooked people.

“आर्जवं हि कुटिलेषु न नीतिः”, is the advice of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, and there is nothing against *Dharmanīti* in this. This is in no way against the *Upadeśas* \(teachings\) of the *Bhagavad Gīta*. There is neither any logic nor any evidence in the *Mahābhārata*, to state that *Gītacārya Kṛshṇa* and the political advisor *Kṛshṇa* are two different persons.

4. Some argue—*“ŚrīKṛshṇa* as a child used to steal butter and curds and played indecently with *gopikās*. How can one believe that this thief and libertine preached the *Bhagavad Gīta?* He was never a good boy. Neither was he a good householder. He was the one who had married sixteen thousand women\!

\(“षोडशस्त्री सहस्रेशः”\) How can such a person be a *Yogācārya Kṛshṇa*?”

Here, there is no need to make a *Kājīnyāya* \(compromise\) stating that *Kṛshṇa* might have made mistakes as an innocent boy, knowingly or unknowingly. He might have blundered during his youth also. But it is possible that in his old age he was transformed into a pious man in the company of great people and became a *Yogācārya* himself.

“In all his activities, be it his childhood pranks, the householder’s life afterwards, the advice during war, or the *Gītopadesha*, he remained a pure *Yogamūrti*. He uplifted the *Cetanās”*—This opine the treatises pertaining to *Kṛshṇa* in a clear language.

Then what was the sound that was produced by *Kṛshṇa* the great personage who was a *Nādayogi* and a *Gānayogi* in his flute, during his playtime? It is nothing but *Omkāra* which elevates the downward senses, the mind and the intellect to the highest level, and make them stay in the *Paramātman*; it \(the *Omkāra*\) is renowned in the *Yogaśāstras* by names such as *tāraka Nādabrahma*, *praṇava*, *Hamsa*, *Nārāyaṇa*, *Dhruva*, *Śambhu* etc.,

“ॐकारार्थमुदीरयन्विजयते वंशीनिनादश्शिशोः” When the *gopikas* who were attracted by it they came to him and had dalliances like the *darśan*, touch, kiss, dance etc., the state of *Śrī Kṛshṇa* at that time was also *aprākṛta* \(spiritual\). It was the state of highest *paramātma samādhi* which is *nityaśuddhabuddhasvarūpa*, *nishkalanirañjana—nirvikāra* and *paramānandamaya*.

It is \(आत्मन्यवरुद्ध सौरतः”\), as the *Bhāgavata* puts it. It is the state of pleasure which is *Ātmanishṭha*. There is no touch of any downward propensity there. The sport which the *Upanishads* call “आत्मक्रीडः आत्मरतिः” happenned there indeed\! And the result of it was the *Ātmoddhara* of the *Gopīs*. In materialistic sports the stream of our *Indriyas* will be downward. But in the case of *gopikās* and *Kṛshṇa*, they surged upwards resulting in staying in the state of *Yogasamādhi*. *Gopikas* became elevated souls. But to the poor creatures who revel only in beastly pleasures which pull them downwards, the acquaintance of this *paśupati bhāva* of this *patitapāvana* is difficult. It is simply foolishness to equate the *Ātmakriḍa* with the *Indriya Krīḍa*, and conclude something. This extraordinary *Yogavaibhava* should be measured only with the pure sentiment of *Śuddhasārasvata* of *Śukabrahmarshi* the *Mahāyogi*.

**5. Once we asked *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* a question. “Why should he steal milk, butter and curds? Were they not available to him, who was the son of the king of *Gopas*?”**

**“When he stealthily entered the houses of *Gopīs* and saw, touched and enjoyed the milk, curds and butter, they were transformed into *Mahāprasādas* of that *Yogipurusha*. The dispositions of those \(i.e. the *Gopīs*\) became pure when they consumed them; and became ready to obtain *paramāanandalābha*. This is why that *Govinda* the compassionate stole them” said the *Guruji*.**

Thus, the very same *Yogācārya* who uplifted the lay *Gopis* in his childhood, later killed *Kamsa*, *Cāṇūra*, *Naraka*, *Śiśupāla*, *Dantavakrā* etc. who were thorns in the path of spirituality, who were *Amśas* and retinue of *Kālipurusha* and who were impossible to be confronted by others, and thus protected the *Dharmasetu*. Likewise, he causes the killing of *Duryodhana* who was a direct representative of the demons, along with his followers, and also the wicked and the arrogant ones who had infiltrated in the *Pānḍava* army in the great *Mahābhārata* war. After the war is over, he motivates *Dharmarāja* to reign as per a constitution based on spirituality. He gets released thousands of kings who were imprisoned by *Narakāsura*, after killing him. He arranges for the release of sixteen thousand women who were subjected to torture by *Narakāsura*, and thus came to be known as their guardian. And the *Paramānandamādhava* rejoiced simultaneously with great *yogabala* in the hearts of all of them who were \(his\) devotees.

Thus we find an *Ekasūtratā* of *Adhyātmayoga* in the entire life of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Paramātma*. This is the *Ekasūtratā* which is visualized by *Jnāna* and *vijnāna*. There is no need to perceive different *Kṛshṇas* \(to match\) the different states of that divine life which was full of *Yoga*. And it is dishonest also.

		
Once, a *jijnāsu* came to ***Mahaguru ŚrīRanga*** and asked him a question. *“Sir, ŚrīRāma* was humble and pious. Because he never boasted of his own greatness. He would just say - “I am a human being, son of Daśaratha and a follower of Dharma” “आत्मानं मानुषं मन्ये रामं दशरथात्मजं” “विद्धि मामृषिभिस्तुल्यं केवलं धर्ममास्थितम्” But *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is not so. He tells *Arjuna*.—“I am God myself. Take refuge in me. I will redeem you of all the sins”: Are these not words of arrogance which cannot be taken as ideal?”

*ŚrīGurudeva* gave him an appropriate answer with a smile. We quote it here, as it is very much relevant. He said “ A millionaire lived in a town. Once, a dear friend of his came and begged him - “Friend, I am in dire straits. You have a lot of money. So please help me a little.” The rich man said, “How could I be a rich person? I too am poor”, and disappointed him. The friend came to him a few days later and protested—“Man\! Why do you call yourself poor even though you have lakhs of rupees and gold ingots?” The rich man replied “Yes, I have a lot of money. But if I call myself rich, it will be arrogance. So, I humbly stated that I am a poor man.” Here, the rich man’s demeanour is not humility but foolishness.

In the present case, *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is extremely rich. He possesses boundless wealth of divine knowledge. Poor *Arjuna* begged him saying “Preach me *Jnāna.* Bless me with wisdom.” Had *ŚrīKṛshṇa* told him—“What *Jnāna* do I know? I am also a layman like you”, he too would make a great fool of himself like that rich man. *Arjuna* would also be disappointed. But *Bhagavān ŚrīKṛshṇa* said “I do possess complete spiritual wealth. Take refuge in me. You will be lifted up.” As *Kṛshṇa* spoke the truth directly, *Arjuna* became a *Kṛtakṛtya* \(blessed\). If truth is declared at the right time, it does not amount to arrogance. Then, why is it that *jnānis* preach to give up *Ahaṅkāra*?

“\(अहरहर्गर्वः परित्यज्यतां\)” The thing is, one has to give up the *Ahaṅkāra* caused by *Dehātmabuddhi* \(materialistc mindset\). One has to give up egotism while talking, which is caused by mistaking the body and senses for *‘Aham’*, paying no regard for the caitanya which is the real *Aham”* This is the purport of the preaching of the *Jnanis*.

When viewed in this light, the immoolesty of insolence of accusing *Kṛshṇa* as *Ahaṅkāri* and advocating the same will vanish from us.

6. The last question pertains to the equating of the dates of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* and Christ.

Some people argue—“The story of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* and *Gītopadeśa* are based on the story and the preachings of Jesus Christ. The pictures of Christ suckling his mother, and vanquishing Satan the serpent were famous in churches and Christian works. The *Purāṇas* prescribe that on the day of *Janmāshṭamī*, one should bring to mind *ŚrīKṛshṇa* suckling his mother and also the taming of *Kāliṅga*. These are based on the above said Christian perceptions. Also, *Bhagavadgīta* has borrowed many things from the Bible. Devotion to God and surrendering to God are examples for this.”—This is simply a ridiculous argument. For, a Greek writer by name Megastanese who had come to India three centuries before the birth of *Christ*, has clearly recorded that worshipping *Kṛshṇa* was in vogue in India at the time of his visit. This proves the fact that the worship of *Kṛshṇa* was in practice even before the birth of Christ. And the pictures of a baby suckling the mother is a universal one and very common and not a monopoly of Christians. Texts of the preChrist era depict deities and *Mahāyogis* taming *Kāliṅganāga*. The concepts of *Bhakti* and *Śaraṇāgati* expounded in the *Gīta* are stated in the *Upanishats* written thousands of years before Christ was born. Thus, without any doubt, the above said arguments hold no water. It has no *pramāṇa* \(authority\) in *Śāstras* and traditions, even to a small extent.

8. That Jesus Christ was a great person who preached and practiced *ātmaguṇas* like truth, love, non-violence can be accepted and respected by us. But, there is no proof to say that the name *Kṛshṇa* was derived from the word Christ, or to say *Kṛshṇa* himself became Christ. Mere similarity in names cannot be cited as proofs to advance a theory. It becomes a thing of ridicule, like the statement “Thames is a river flowing in London. The name was changed to *‘Tamasā’* and was inserted in *Vālmīkī Rāmāyaṇa”*.

Some say:—

9. “We see the posture of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* holding the flute horizontally on his lips and playing it, in the pictures and images in South India. On the other hand, in North India, the flute is held vertically while playing it like the *Nāgasvara*. So both these *Kṛshṇas* are different. The first one i.e., *Veṇugopāla*, was an influential person of South India and the other one was a capable politician from the north. As the names sound similar, by illusion both were mistaken as one and the same and ultimately it transformed into a faith”. Is this right? We clearly reply that this view is against all the *pramāṇas* and is indeed a very strange one.

There is no evidence in any of the age old texts, images, incriptions, coins or ancient remains to prove that two *Kṛshṇan’s* existed. This theory is against the tradition which has been in practice for thousands of years in this country. There is no evidence whatsoever to prove that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born or brought up in South India. All ancient texts and traditions tell us that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born in *Mathurā* in North India in *Kstatriya* family belonging to the *Yadu* race. He was brought up by *Vaisyas* whose profession was cattle rearing. The places of amusement in his childhood were *Nanda Gokula* and *Brindavan* on the banks of the river *Yamuna*. Later he made *Mathurā* his abode and finally he settled in *Dvāraka*.

He was a very close relative of the *Pānḍavās* and their bosom friend, their counsel, and greatest helper. He is the *Paramācārya* who led *Arjuna* in the path of duty by teaching the *Gīta* in the battlefield, when *Arjuna* was completely dumbfounded due to *śoka* and *moha* \(grief and passion\). Guiding the *Pānḍavās* at every step in the war, he handed victory to *Yudhishṭhira* and installed him on the throne. This purport is depicted not just in the texts of the *Vaidika parampara* but also in *Jain* texts. There is not a single place in South India which can be cited as the place of his birth, the place where he was brought up, or the place of his activities etc.

And to say that *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* complexion resembled the *Tamāla* or, like a cloud filled with water, and so he belonged to South India is simply ridiculous. Should not a great person belonging to North India have such a complexion? *ŚrīRāmacandra* also possessed a lustrous *Shyāmalavarṇa*. \(dark complexion\) “समः समविभक्ताङ्गः वर्णं श्यामं समाश्रितः” \(*Rāmāyaṇa SundaraKāṇḍa* 35-17\) “So *Rāma* too must be a South Indian leader. But *Lakshmaṇa* could be from North India as he was fair complexioned” - This way they have to continue their argument\!

10. Now about *ŚrīKṛshṇa* holding the flute horizontally. The origin of the *Saṅgīta Śāstra* is the same for both South India and North India. But historically speaking South India didn’t suffer much from alien invasions compared to North India. Scholars agree as South India was far away from such invasions for a long time, and also because of the patronage of able Hindu rulers, the age old traditions of arts continue here., So, one need not have a wrong notion that *Śrī Kṛshṇa*, at the end of *Dvāpara* held his flute exactly like the North Indians today, while playing it. Based on that wrong notion and creating an offspring of it by assigning one *Kṛshṇa* for the north and another one for the South, and allowing it to graze in the brainfields of people, is sheer nonsense and *adharma*, we wish to say.

Further, *ŚrīKṛshṇa* delineated in the *Itihāsa Purāṇas,* is not a product of a factory of fancy. He is the *chinmūrti* visualised in the hearts of *Yogis*, who is beyond *Kalpanās, Sankalpās* and *vikalpās* \(of unenlightened persons\). How did he look like? How is he now? How did he hold the flute?”—Answers to these questions have to be obtained from *Yogis*. We can also see it when we obtain the *‘Satyadṛshṭi’*. The *jnānis* say that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* visualized thus, is seen holding the flute horizontally, as is seen in our pictures and images. And it is indeed *jnānis* again who have guided the sculptors \(for such artefacts\)\! And it is the same flutist Lord *Kṛshṇa* who is also a statesman, a soldier, a *yogi*, a *manīshī*, a *hitaishī*, etc and a repository of *Jnāna*, strength, wealth, vigour, power and lustre. In short, He is an all pervading and all knowing force.

11. The next question is whether *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is a great person to be venerated or a *Paramātman* who is an auspicious refuge for worship and meditation?

Human beings and Gods have distinct characteristics. So, to call a God a human being and viceversa amount to offending truth. But when a human being ascends to the highest state of *Brāhmī Sthiti* as a result of *tapas, Jnāna* and *samādhi*, he can be called by appropriate names such as *jnāni*, a devotee, a *guṇātīta* and a *sthitaprajna*, and may be worshipped as euqual to god also. Similarly, God who is omnipresent, omnipotent and master of all \(spiritual\) doctrines may by his *saṅkalpa*, appear as a human being and attract a *cetana* by his activities. Such manifestations are called *avatāras*. As *ŚrīKṛshṇa* displayed both the characteristics, to which category he belongs is the question\! Is he the one who rose to the level of god after being born as a human being? Or a God who conducted himself as a human being before us? This needs to be discussed. He destroyed hundreds of wicked and others who had assumed the form of animals, birds and human beings troubling the world in different ways, such as *Agha, Baka, Kamsa, Cāṇūra, Śiśupāla Dantavakrā* and many others who were invincible by others, and thus, he helped the world. He led a life committed to ideals and full of *dharma* and presented himself as a role model for human beings. These were the activities as a *naraśreshṭha*. Similarly, he granted *yogasamādhi* to *Gopikās* when they had his *darśana* and touch, and when they meditated upon him. He granted *viśvarūpadarśana* to *Yashodā, Akrūra, Arjuna, Udaṅka* etc. He bestowed *Moksha* upon *Mucukunda* and others. All these are divine acts. Thus, we come across both human and divine activities in equal prominence and in a harmonious blend in the *ŚrīKṛshṇacarita* written by *Maharshi* \(*Vedavyāsa*\).

Some people who took into consideration only the human part of the activities, respected *Śrī Kṛshṇa* as a *‘Mahāpurusha’*. Even the likes of *Duryodhana* person who hated him made all efforts to win him over to their side as a superman. According to *Duryodhana*, *ŚrīKṛshṇa* had all great qualities. But the only defect in him was that he sided with the *Pānḍavas*.

> स हि पूज्यतमो लोके कृष्णः पृथुललोचनः ।   
> त्रयाणामपि लोकानां विदितं मम सर्वथा ॥ 

*Kintu*, \(But\),

> अनुरक्तोह्यसंहार्यः पार्थान्प्रति जनार्दनः ।   
\(महाभारत उद्योगपर्व, B. 88, श्लो 1-5\) 

At the *Rājasūyayāga* when he was chosen for the *‘Agrapūja’* no one except *Śiśupāla* who was overcome with the curse of *Sanakādi Maharshis*, forbid it. This shows that he was generally honoured by all and everyone respected him for various reasons. Only demon-incarnations despised him. But neither those large number of people who respected him nor those few mean persons who despised him were aware of his innate divinity. They just knew him as *Naravāsudeva* but not as *‘Paravāsudeva*.’ Some could understand that he was an incarnation of *Paramātma* at some points of time. But at times that truth would be hidden.

		
“He is the very incarntion of Lord *Nārāyaṇa”*.

> एष नारायणः श्रीमान् क्षीरार्णव निकेतनः ।   
> नागपर्यङ्कमुत्सृज्य ह्यागतो मधुरां पुरीम् ॥ 

Only *Mahātmas* like *Bhīshma, Nārada, Vyāsa, Asita, Devala* etc knew that all his activities were impelled by the *divya caitanya*. In this way, *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas* have described both his human and divine natures harmoniously, and so it becomes clear that he was the very *Paramātman* who conducted himself like a human being.

“गूढं परंब्रह्म मनुष्यलिङ्गम्” *Maharshis* say that he is the very *Parabrahman* who dwelt inside, but exhibited human characteristics externally, concealing his *Parasvarūpa*.

God has five special powers. Viz., creation, Sustenance, destruction blessings and concealment. When he uses the power of blessing among those powers, people realize his *parasvarūpa*. But when he weilds the power of *Tirodhāna* \(concealment\), his *Paramārthasvarūpa* is hidden away from \(the minds of\) the people. Such a situation existed when *ŚrīKṛshṇa* lived on this earth. It is natural that it exists even after that time also.

“Dull headed ones look at my human form and they do not respect me. They are not aware of my greatness as the Lord of all creation, but great people with divine dispositions understand me as the Lord who is a *Bhūtadi* and worship me.”

> अवजानन्ति मां मूढाः मानुषीं तनुमाश्रितम् ।   
> परं भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥ 

> महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिताः।   
> भजन्त्यनन्य मनसो ज्ञात्वा भूतादिमव्ययम् ॥ 

The word *“Mahāpurusha”* has two meanings. One meaning is ‘A great person.’ *Paramapurusha* or *Paramātma* is the other meaning. Most people accept *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as a *Mahāpurusha* in the first sense. But there are strong evidences for the second sense also, that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is a *Mahāpurusha* himself.

a\) *Bhīshma*, *Vyāsa* and other *Yogipuṅgavās* very clearly say that He is *Paramātma* himself. *ŚrīKṛshṇa* also proclaims on some special occasions, that he is *Paramātma* himself. But, all those who claim themselves to be *Parmātma*, cannot be acknowledged as incarnations of *Paramātma*. It should be established by *Yogic* experience. In the *Bhagavad Gīta, ŚrīKṛshṇa* tells *Arjuna* his dear friend“—Surrender to me and to me alone”

\(माम् एकं शरणं व्रज\) Surrender to only that *Bhagavān* and no one else.

तमेव शरणं गच्छ\)

When both these sentences are taken together, it purports to mean that both the persons, i.e., the one who says “me” and *“Bhagavān”* are one and the same.

He proclaims that he is *Paramātma* himself in clear terms, and blessing *Arjuna* with *Jnānadrshṭi* shows him the *Viśvarūpa*.

“There was no reference to *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as God in the original version of the *Mahābhāratha* and it was interpolated later” some say. This is not correct. There are no evidences, internal or external \(in the *Mahābhārata*, to state that divinity was attributed to him at a later time.

Many characters in the *Mahābhārata*, who were his friends and even foes, call him by the names *‘Acyuta’ ‘Madhusūdana’*, *‘Mādhava’*, *‘Janārdana’* etc, which are all the names of Lord *Mahāvishṇu*. They would not have used such names to refer to him if the impression that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was an incarnation had not been prevalent those days. Even if those *Vishṇuvācaka* words were to be removed to please the opponent for the moment by accepting the untruth temporarily as purpoted in the axim “तुष्यतु दुर्जनः,” \(Let the vicious be pleased\), then thousands of *ślokas* and parts of *ślokas* will have to be changed and thousands of slokas have to be composed afresh, and in fact, a new *Mahābhārata* itself will have to be written. What for is all this ado?

Like *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, *ŚrīRāma* also being an *avatāra* of *Mahāvishṇu*, has conducted himself concealing his divine *svarūpa* to a greater extent. But *ŚrīKṛshṇa* proclaims his divinity on many occasions, and displays His *yogamahimā* also.

It should not be deemed that the above said texts are the only authority to conclude that *ŚrīRāma* and *ŚrīKṛshṇa* are incarnations of God. Some may write new books stating that both of them were not *avatārās*, and in such a situation, there is a likelihood of a friction between both the texts. And it has happened also. The how can one draw conclusion in such a situation? Only the *jnānis* can state with affirmation, that a certain person can be called an *avatāra*. Not only that—whatever may be the era of the *jnāni’s*, the conclusion that such and such a person is an *avatārapurusha* should be unanimous when they \(the *jnānis*\) view him through their *jnānandṛshṭi*. His forms, internal or external, should be the same, either before the *avatāra*, during the *avatāra* and after the *avatāra*. In the present context, *ŚrīKṛshṇa* heralds that he is the *avatāra* of *Nārāyaṇa*. Many enlightened personages such as ancient *jnānis* like *Vedavyāsa*, *ŚrīKṛshṇacaitanya* who belonged to the middle ages, *ŚrīRāmaKṛshṇa Paramahamsa* of the recent times and *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* the man reponsible for vitalising our souls, have all visualized *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as an *avatāra* of *Mahāvishṇu* in their *jnānbhūmi,* and have professed their experiences as well.

Therefore we proclaim that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* is the incarnation of *Mahāvishṇu* the god of gods and the great Lord, that he redeemed the world by his acts and deeds, both divine and human, and continues to do so.

The great *Parva* on which we worship him is *ŚrīKṛshṇa Janmāshṭamī, Śrī Jayantī* or *Gokulāshṭamī*. We have already given a detailed account of the theory of incarnations in the chapter of *ŚrīRāmanavami*.

In the following pages we shall discuss in brief the details about the day, time and modalities of celebrating this *parva*.

Some may raise the following objection-“There is nothing indeed to discuss about the day and time of celebrating this *parva*. It is as good as done, if it is celebrated every year on a particular day in a particular month, just like celebrating Christmas, *Gandhi Jayanti* etc. This is a simple matter which even small children can decide easily. Why do you rack your brain by thinking through and discussing such a simple matter?”

This objection may sound genuine superficially. But right thinking people can not agree with this. Because, as we have been noting from the beginning, the observance of such *parvas* depends on matters such as, what are the *sāmanyadharmas* and *viśeshadharmas* in the different limbs of the *Kālapurusha*, how can those *dharmas* be utilized for the accomplishment of the *Purushārthas*? Etc. When these are discussed on the right lines and a conclusion is arrived at, there won’t be any racking of the brain and, on the other hand, even a racked brain gets set right. We observe that the benefits obtained by celebrating the *Mahāparva* with such a great *Manodharma* are many times greater than the one celebrated on the basis of merely a particular date, month etc.

		
\(*Śrī Kṛshṇa*\) *Janmāshṭamī*, or *Gokulashṭamī* or *Kṛshṇa Jayanthi* is a *parva* pertaining to the birth of Lord *Kṛshṇa*. If we can know the limbs \(special features\) of the time of the Lord’s birth, it will be of help to decide when his birthday should be celebrated.

What do the *Ithihāsa pramāṇas* tell us about the *tithi*, *vāra* and *nakshatra* at the time of *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* birth? They say—“It was a very auspicious time. All the great features had conjoined at that time, when the planets and stars were *prasanna* \(tranquil\) and the star was *Rohiṇi*.”

> अथ सर्वगुणोपेतः कालः परमशोभनः   
> यर्ह्यैवाजन जन्मर्क्षं शान्तर्क्षग्रहतारकम् 

The *BhavishyottaraPurāṇa* says “Lord *Kṛshṇa* himself has said that he was born as the son of *Vasudeva* and *Devakī* in *Rohiṇi Nakshatra*, at midnight of *Bhādrapadamāsa*, *kṛśṇapaksha* when the sun was in *Simharāśi* and the moon was in *Vṛshabhalagna*.

The *Harisvamśa* says that the *nakshatra* at the time of *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s avatāra* was *Abhijit*. That night is called *Jayantī* and the *muhūrta* at the time of his birth is called *‘Vijaya’*.

> अभिजिन्नाम नक्षत्रं जयन्ती नाम शर्वरी ।   
> मुहूर्तो विजयो नाम यत्र जातो जनार्दनः ॥ 

*Skanda Purāṇa* says that *Śrī Kṛshṇa* was born at the time of *Rohiṇī nakshtra* on the *ashṭamī* of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* of the month of *Śrāvaṇa*.

> प्राजापत्येन संयुक्ता अष्टमी सा यदा भवेत् ।   
> श्रावणे बहुले सा तु सर्वपापप्रणाशिनी॥ 

“Well, *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* birthday can be celebrated on the day in the year, in which the *Māsa*, *Tithi, Nakshatra* and *muhūrthas* occur, as mentioned in the *Itihāsa Purāṇas*. What is there to discuss?” One may ask. It is fine if all the above mentioned *Tithi, Nakshatra, Māsa* and *Muhūrtas* occur on the same day. But some *śāstraic* statements say that the month of God’s *avatāra* is *Śrāvaṇa*. And they mention that he incarnated in the month of *Bhādrapada*. We also come across statements, which say that the incarnation was in the month of *Sihma*. But the opinion that he incarnated in the midnight of *Ashṭamī* at the time of *Rohiṇi nakshatra* is agreed by all. “But *Rohiṇi* may not happen to prevail when it is *Ashṭamī.* Then should his birthday be celebrated on the day of the occurrence of *Rohiṇī*? Or should it be observed on *Ashṭamī*?”—This question arises.

“Which *māsa* should the celebration be? *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*?”—is another question.

Some try to solve it as follows—“If the rule *“Kṛshaṇa pakshādimāsa* is followed, *Janmāshṭamī* falls in *Bhādrapada* month. If the rule *Śuklapakshādi māsa* is followed, then it will be in *Śrāvaṇa*.”

“इयं अष्टमी कृष्णपक्षादिमासविवक्षया भाद्रपदमासे भवति, शुक्लपक्षादि मासविवक्षया श्रावणे भवति”

As per the *Cāndramāna* system *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* birth took place in *Śrāvaṇa*, but as per *Sauramāna* it happened in *Simha māsa*. But when *Simha* and *Śrāvaṇa* months do not coincide, in which month should *Kṛshṇa Jayantī* be celebrated? This is another problem which arises.

And *VarāhaPurāṇa* says that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born on *Śukla dvadaśi* of the month of *Āshāḍha*. “This is against all that has been said so far,” objects a scholar. This objection is not correct. Because, as per *Purāṇas* it was the day on which *Vasudeva* observed a *Vrata* to obtain *Kṛshṇa* as his son. It is a day on which the couple observed a *Vrata* to please God. This is all the purport. So, the statement does not indicate that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born on that day.

> आषाढे शुक्लपक्षे या नारी तु सह भर्तृणा ।   
> उपोष्यति मनुष्येषु तस्या गर्भे भवाम्यहम् ॥   
> एतां च द्वादशीं गत्वा वसुदेवो महायशाः॥ 

One more question that needs discussion is whether both *Janmāshṭamī* and *ŚrīJayantī* happen to be the two names of the same *parva* or are they different? If both are different which one of them is more important? Some people are of the opinion that *Janmāshṭamī* itself is more important and people observe only that. “सत्यं अर्थभेदः लोकस्तु जन्माष्टमीमेव अनुतिष्ठन्ति.” Some others say that *Śrī Jayantī* itself is more important.

What should be the *Vyāpti* of either *Rohiṇi* or *Ashṭamī* on that day? This question also needs to be answered. If it is conjoined with a particular *vāra* \(day\), will there be any special effect? The answer to this question is very clear. If it is a *Monday* or a *Wednesday* it is best for the observance of *Janmāshṭamī* and *ŚrīJayantī*, according to *Śāstras*.

“अष्टमी बुधवारे च सोमे चैव द्विजोत्तम । रोहिण्यर्क्षेण संयुक्ता कुलकोटिविमुक्तिदा”

—says the *PadmaPurāṇa*.

a\) All the names viz *ŚrīJayantī*, *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī*, *Janmāshṭamī* and *Gokulāshṭamī*—are synonyms for the day on which *Kṛshṇa* was born. The first question is whether these are different names which refer to various *Vratās* pertaining to the birth of that God or do they refer to the same *Vratā*. Among these, it can be considered that *Śrī Jayantī* as the alternate name of *Śrī Kṛshṇa Jayantī*, and, *Gokulāhṭamī* is an alternate name given to *Śrī \(Kṛshṇa\) Janmāsṭamī*. But the main question is whether *Śrī Jayantī* and *Janmāshṭamī* refer to the same *Vrata*, or whether they are two different *vratotsavas?* \(*Kālanirṇaya*\).

Scholars say that these are two different *Vratas*. In support of this they put forth the following reasons. 1\) The names are altogether different. 2\) *Janmāshṭamī* requires the presence of *Kṛshṇa Ashṭamī* for the celebration, whereas *Śrī Jayantī* requires the presence of star *Rohiṇi*. 3\) Only fasting is suggested on *Janmāshṭamī*. But on the day of *ŚrīJayantī* both fasting and *dāna* are prescribed. 4\) *Janmāshṭamī* is a *nitya Vrata*, whereas *ŚrīJayantī* is both *nitya* and *Kāmya*. 5\) both the names are stated separately in the same *Śāstravākya*.

> जन्माष्टमी जयन्ती च शिवरात्रिस्तथैव च ।   
> पूर्वविद्धैव कर्तव्या तिथिभान्ते च पारणम् ॥ 

Among the above reasons, the first, the third and the fourth are not agreeable to all. This is because \(1\) one *Vrata* may have different names 2\) Fasting, worship and *dāna* may be observed in both the *Vratās*. 3\) *Janmāshṭamī* and *Śrī Jayantī* can be either *nitya* and *kāmya* from the point of view of the way they are observed

> तस्मान्मां पूजयेच्छक्ता शुचिस्सम्यगुपोषितः।   
> ब्राह्मणान्भोजयेद्भक्त्या ततो दद्याच्च दक्षिणाम् ॥   
> हिरण्यधान्यभूगावो वासांसि कुसुमानि च ।   
> यद्यदिष्टतमं तत्तद्विष्णुर्मे प्रीयतामिति ॥ 

Here *Pūja*, *dāna* and fasting are decided based on the *tithi* and *nakshatra*. By performing this *Vrata* one can get sins redeemed, desires fulfilled and especially can secure the love of God.

\(अतो जयन्तीव जन्माष्टमी च नित्यकाम्या च, दशनिर्णय I\)

Even thinkers can’t reject the reasons second and fifth, as they are strong. In *Kṛshṇāshṭamī*, prominence is for the *Asṭamītithi* of that *Kṛshṇapaksha* whereas star *Rohiṇī* of that *Kṛshṇapaksha* is regarded as important in *Śrī Jayanti*. Moreoever, it is clear that the same *Śastravākya* \(i.e. *Bhṛgu Maharshi vacana*\) calls *Janmāshṭamī*, *ŚrīJayantī* and *Śivarātri* by different names, and states the *Kālanirṇaya* and *Pāraṇavidhis* pertaining to them.

Thus, it is clear that the opinion of the *śāstras* that both *Śrī Jayantī* and *Kṛshṇashṭamī* are two different *utsavas*, though both refer to *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* day of birth.

**We humbly recall here the words of *Śrī RaṅgaMahāguru* who said” *“Janmāshṭamī* and *Śrī Jayantī* are two different *parvas*. *Ashṭamī tithi* is prominent for the former and *Rohiṇi nakshatra* for the latter”**

b\) Which is more important of the two i.e. *Janmāshṭamī* and *Jayantī*? Even scholars are of divided opinion on this. “Generally people observe *Janmāshṭamī* only.”

“लोकास्तु जन्माष्टमीमेव अनुतिष्ठन्ति” says the *Nirṇayasindhu*. *“Śrī Jayantī* is generally observed by everyone. \(रक्ताविरक्ता वा शक्त्या जयन्त्यामुपोष्यन्ति\)” says the *Jayantī Nirṇaya*. Between these two the former is the tradition in North India and the latter is in South India, say some scholars, as a *Samadhāna* to the two contradicting sentences. But there are people who observe both *Śrī Jayantī* and *Janmāshṭamī* both in the north and in the south. Both these *parvas* have been looked upon with equal importance. Some argue that *tithi* is more important than the *nakshatra*. It is not correct. Statements like—

“तिथिरेकगुणा प्रोक्ता नक्षत्रं तु चतुर्गुणम्” give importance to *Nakshatra*.

Either of the two can be observed as per one’s liking or wish. Both the *Janmātithi* and *Janmanakshatra* are equally sacred. Some devout devotees observe both the *utsavas,* when these two fall on different days. It is not proper to discriminate them as more important and less important.

c\) Is it appropriate to observe them when there is the *vedha* of the *tithi* or *Nakshatra*? Or should they be observed on a day when there is no such *vedha*? There are differences of opinion on this issue as well.

“पूर्वविद्धा जयन्ती वा” “जयन्त्यां पूर्वविद्धायां” “पूर्वविद्धैव कर्तव्या तिथिभान्ते च पारणम्”

Statements such as these praise the *tithi* and *nakshatra* which have *Vedha*. And the statements—

> “रोहिणी तु यदाष्टम्याम्” “अष्टमी कृष्णपक्षस्य”   
> “सप्तमी संयुता न हि” “अष्टमी सप्तमी विद्धा रोहिणी कृत्तिकायुता”   
> “दशम्यैकादशी विद्धा हन्ति पुण्यं पुरातनम्” 

etc. prohibit the *vedha* of *saptami* and *Kritika nakshatra*.

So, which is proper? To observe the *Vrata* on the days when *tithi* and *nakshatra* have *vedha* or on the days without *Vedha*? If both are appropriate why the *Śāstras* make contradictory statements? As a matter of fact both the occasions viz. the *tithi* and *nakshatras* with *vedha* and the ones without *vedha* which have the nod of the *śāstrās* are auspicious indeed for the above said worship of the Lord. It is not in the fitness of things to categorize them as appropriate and inappropriate, best and worst, or primary and secondary. Actually speaking, there are no contradictions in the statements above. We don’t find any *śāstravirodha* here, as *jnānis* have stated an arrangement which is as follows: *Tithi* and *Nakshatras* with *Vedha* are important to those who seek from God all the four accomplishments viz. *Dharma, Artha, Kāma* and *Moksha*. To those who seek only *Moksha, Tithi* and *Nakshatra* without *Vedha* are important.

d\) *Śāstras* say that if *Janmāshṭamī* and *ŚrīJayanti* happen to fall on Mondays and Wednesdays, it is most auspicious.

“बुधसोमसमायुक्ता जयन्ती यदि लभ्यते न कुर्यात् गर्भवासं च तत्र कृत्वा व्रतं व्रती” “अष्टमी बुधवारेण किं कृता व्रतकोटिभिः” “अष्टमी बुधवारे च सोमे चैव द्विजोत्तम । रोहिणी ऋक्षसंयुक्ता कुलकोटि विमुक्तिदा॥”

Why are Mondays and Wednesdays preferred for the observance of *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* birthday? Some say—*“Śrī Kṛshṇa* belongs to the *candravamsa*. Therefore Monday is best for *ŚrīKṛshṇa Pūja*. *Budha* is the son of *Soma* and therefore *Budhavāra* is also auspicious for *ŚrīKṛshṇa Janmotsava Pūja*.” But it is not correct. Because, *ŚrīRāma* doesn’t belong to *Candravamśa*. But those very two days are stated as highly precious by the *śāstras* for *Śrī Rāmanavamī* also, which we have to note. **We wish to quote here the answers bestowed by *ŚrīRaṅgaMahāguru*, which happen to be the ones accomplished by the experience of the *Yogis.* He said—“On Mondays and Wednesdays, the natural dispositions will be helpful for the *Sakshātkāra* of *ŚrīRāma* and *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. The centers pertaining to *ŚrīRāma* and *ŚrīKṛshṇa* blosoom in us on that day, by the grace of nature.”**

e\) Some *Śāstras* consider the month of *Śrāvaṇa* as very auspicious for celebrating *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s* birthday and some others recommend the month of *Bhādrapada* for that.

“रोहिणी सहिता कृष्णा मासि भाद्रपदेष्टमी” “श्रावणे बहुले सा तु सर्वपापप्रणाशिनी”

In that case, which month should we consider appropriate for *Janmāshṭamī* and *ŚrīJayantī*? To this question, some try to answer as below—“The one which becomes *Śrāvaṇī* from the point of view of *Śuklapakshādi māsa*, becomes *Bhādrapadī* from the point of view of *Kṛshṇa Pakshādimāsa*. There is no difference between the two.”—With this answer, they try to get over this controversy. But as per this argument, if *amāvāsyā* happens to occur in *Karkāṭakamāsa*, the *Kṛshṇāshṭamī* of that period becomes *Śrāvaṇī* and *bhādrapadī*. And so, then only *Janmāshṭamī* and *ŚrīJayanti* should be observed. If one decides to observe it then itself, the *śāstraic* statements, such as

“सिंहस्थेऽर्केऽसिते पक्षे रोहिण्यामष्टमीयुते” “सिंहार्के रोहिणीयुक्ता नभः कृष्णाष्टमी यदि”

should to be considered.

A treatise by name *‘Jyothishārṇava’* says that *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī* should be observed in the *Simha māsa* itself, whether it is *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*. And, the months of *Karkāṭaka* and *kanyā* are not auspicious for the *Ārādhana* of the *Jayanti*.

> श्रावण्यां पोष्ठपद्यां वा यदा सिम्हगतो रविः ।   
> जयन्त्याराधनं कुर्यात् न तु कर्कटकन्ययोः ॥ 

When such is the case, is *Śrāvaṇa* important for the observance of *Kṛshṇa’s* birthday or is it *Bhādrapada*? Or *Simha*? We wish to say that, for those who observe *JanmāshṭamīVrata, Srāvaṇamāsa* is important, and, *Simha* for those who observe *ŚrīJayanti*.

*Harivamśa* and other *Purāṇas* tell us that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born on the *ashṭamī* of *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*. But the *VarāhaPurāṇa* says that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born on *Āshāḍha Śuddha Dvādaśī*. Some scholars express surprise that these statements are completely contradictory and that they do not agree on the month, *tithi* and *nakshatra* \(of this great divine event\). But, we wish to say that they have only conjured up the contradiction, because, they have not grasped the full meaning of the statement in the *VarāhaPurāṇa*. The purport of that *śloka* is as follows: “A wife who observes *Upavāsavrata* in *Āshaḍha Śuklapaksha* along with her husband, will be blessed by the Lord, as the Lord appears in the interior of her heart. The great *Vasudeva* observed the *Vrata* on that *Dvādaśī* and obtained *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as his son, and also obtained great wealth. Therefore, one should observe Lord *Vishṇu’s Vrata* on *Āshāḍha—Śukladvadaśī*, and such persons will be blessed with good progeny and wealth.” All couples can observe this *Vrata*. It is not at all said there that *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born on that day.

> एतां च द्वादशीं गत्वा वसुदेवो महायशाः ।   
> पुत्रं लेभे स कृष्णाख्यं महतीं च श्रियं तथा ॥ 

It is important to discuss at what time the Lord should be worshipped on *Janmāshṭamī* or *ŚrīJayanti*. It is best to offer special worship to God at the exact time of his incarnation. This is our opinion. The *śāstrās* say that he was born during the dark night at midnight, and at the time of the rising moon.

“मुहूर्तेऽभिजिति प्राप्ते सार्धरात्रे विभूषिते” “मासे प्रोष्ठपदेऽष्टम्यां अर्धरात्रे विधूदये” “निशीथे तम उद्भूते”

Those who cannot keep awake till that point of time and offer worship, may do the *pūja* before midnight in the *Vṛshabha lagna*; because, it was *Vṛshabha lagna* when the Lord took birth, says the *Brahmasamhitā*

“बुधवारे वृषे लग्ने रोहिण्याश्चरमाम्शके”

Those who are too weak and cannot afford to observe fast tilll night, can perform the *Pūja* at noon; but there is no doubt about that performing the *Pūja* at night, and especially, at midnight, is most auspicious.

When Lord *ŚrīKṛshṇa* was born, it was *Simha Rāśi* and the month was *Śrāvaṇa*. \(In one sense it is also *Bhādrapada*\). God incarnated when all these i.e., *Ashṭamī*, *Wednesday*, auspicious *Harshaṇa Yoga* and *Kaulava Karaṇa* occurred in the midnight at the time of moonrise. If the above said *tithi*, *vāra, nakshatra*, *yoga* and *Kāraṇa* happen to occur on any day in *simhamāsa* or *Srāvaṇamāsa*, that day is indeed the best \(day\) for the celebration of God’s birthday. The more all these come together, it is more excellent.

The following *siddhāntas* \(conclusions\) are mentioned for the observation of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī* in the work *tithitatva* “If the *Jayantī yoga* prevails just for a day, fasting and *Pūja* should be observed on that very day. If the *yoga* extends for two days, the *Vrata* should be observed on the second day. If *Jayanti* does not prevail, the *Vrata* should be observed on *Ashṭamī* with *Rohiṇi*. If *Ashṭamī* extends on both the days along with *Rohiṇi*, fasting should be observed on the second day. If star *Rohiṇī* is not there, the *Vrata* should be observed at the midnight of *ashṭamī*. If *ashṭamī* spreads over two days, or it prevails at midnight or, if *ashṭamī* is not there at midnight on both the days, the *Vrata* should be observed on the second day only.” And, the opinion of the author of *Daśanirṇaya* is as follows—“Even if there is no *tithiyoga*, the *Vrata* is to be observed in *Rohiṇi nakshatra* only.”

> “तिथ्ययोगेपि नक्षत्रे केवलेऽर्चनमिष्यते।” \(पद्यसंहिता\)   
> “रोहिण्यामेव कुर्वीत कृष्णजन्मादिकम् ॥” 

If *Rohiṇi* and *ashṭamī* do not co-exist, *Pūja* should be performed, giving prominence to any one of them.

Scholars of standing have written volumious treatises on this topic. We have incidentally collected only very important aspects here pertaining to those issues.

Thus, we discussed when \(i.e. on what day\) and at what time, the birthday festival of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* which is very well-known by names such as *ŚrīKṛshṇa Janmāshṭamī, Śrījayantī* etc should be observed. We have also discussed what *Śāstras* say about this, and about the traditional practices prevailing in different parts of our country. But one question still remains unsolved. The details of which are as follows:—

What is the *tithi* of that day? What is the *nakshathra*? When do they begin? How long do they extert their influence? Pertaining to these issues, there is no unanimity at all in the *Pañchāṅgas*. For example, the statements of *Vākya pañcāṅga* and the *Siddhānta* do not tally at all. Which of these statements should be taken as authentic? This is the question. When such a question arises, the practice of the devotees is to either to follow the tradition in the family, or to act as per the direction of their respective *Ācāryas-Maṭhādhipatis* and getting satisfaction to the mind is generally seen. Then, how to find a scientific and precise answer to this?

It is natural that India \(being a vast country\) experiences different timings of sunrise and sunset in different parts. If the *pañcāṅgas* take into account these differences and represent them accordingly, then it will be indeed scientific. But various *Pañcāṅgas* confront us which differ on the *tithis* and *nakshatras* pertaining to the same geographical place The source texts for those *Pañcāṅgas* are also different. Then how to know which work is authentic? Here, one has to point his hand at mother nature inevitably. The planets and stars which remain in their natural positions, and which remain impervious to any handiwork or clever mind, happen to be the honest and divine sources. And that is why the adage *“Pañchaṅga hodare nakshatra hoyite?”*. has come up. And based on that valuable source, suitable changes have to be effected in our *Pañcaṅgas*.

***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* had said on one occasion—“Sometimes some changes happen in the position and movement of planets and stars. Such changes have to be observed from time to time and the calculations in the *Pañcāṅgās* have to be renewed. This has not been done for centuries in our country. At least now it has to be done and the results have to be incorporated in our *Pañcaṅgas”*. *We humbly remember this at this juncture*.**

The time for *parvapūja* which is guided by *Mahātmas* who are *Jnānavijnānatṛptātmas*, who on the basis of either *Nāḍivijnāna*, psychology or astroscience, and also on the authority of their pure internal *preraṇā*-should be honoured and taken as totally authentic. When such a guidance is unavailable, the conclusion drawn with the help of *Śāstrās* and *yukti* has to be made use of. When the exact time point becomes unavailable, *pūja* done at the nearest time point also yields the results at least partly.

Now, with the discussion on the time \(of worship\) just concluded, the discipline and modalities pertaining to that day may be taken up.

We come across diversities in *Śāstra* and *Sampradāya* regarding the observation of this *parva*. But, all pious persons agree on the point that one has to remain pure and offer special worship to *ŚrīKṛshṇa* with faith and devotion. Centering around that point, other things can be incorporated accordingly. The main aspects of observance are special *Pūja* to the Lord, *Kathāsaṅkīrtana*, fasting, *Jāgaraṇa*, *dānadharma* etc.

> सोपवासो हरेः पूजां कृत्वा तत्र न सीदति।   
> उपवासस्य नियमं गृहणीयाद् भक्तिभावतः॥ 

> रात्रौ प्रजागरः कार्यः नृत्यगीतसमाकुलः।   
> कर्तव्यं वित्तमानेन दानं भक्तजनैरपि । 

In the worship and fasting that are prescribed hereby, which is important and which is secondary? Scholars have discussed these points in detail.

> केवलेनोपवासेन तस्मिन् जन्मदिने मम ।   
> शतजन्मकृतात्पापात् मुच्यते नात्र संशयः।   
> बहुजन्मकृतं पापं हन्ति सोपोषिता तिथिः ॥ 

Quotes like these glorify only the importance of fasting. Based on this, some people argue that fasting is more important than worship. Though their arguments are clever they do not seem endowed with discernment. Conclusions should not be drawn based on literal meanings of *Śāstravākyas*. The purport of *Śāstravākyas* should be comprehended suitably. Don’t the *Śāstras* say—

> केवलं शास्त्रमाश्रित्य न कर्तव्यो विनिर्णयः ।   
> युकिहीने विचारे तु धर्महानिः प्रजायते ॥ 

\(“Conclusions should not be drawn merely on the basis of the literal meanings of *Śāstraśabdas*. If the matter is not tempered by logic it may harm *dharma*\). At the moment, fasting means drying up of the body, \(as per prescriptions.\). *Pūja* is for the nourishment of the *Ātma*. Should the body be dried up or should the *Ātma* be nourished for the sake of drying up of the body? Between these two which is principal and which is subordinate? This can be decided by *Viveka* only. Sustenance of *Ātma* through *Pūja* is principal and drying up of the body being instrumental to it is secondary to that and there can be no doubt about that. The statements which praise the act of fasting terming it as greatly beneficial, have the purport in the above *Śāstravākyas*. Why should fasting be praised thus? It is because, if fasting is done, the disposition gets purified and the required tranquility of the *Dhātus* is obtained. And it helps the mind to get purified and become steady. And so, fasting is praised to such an extent.

> सोपवासो हरेः पूजां कृत्वा तत्र न सीदति ॥ 

		
This *Śāstra vacana* clearly states that fasting is auxiliary to the *Pūja*.

These who are weak and cannot fast for the whole day may take light and *sātvik* food as prescribed by the *śāstras* and perform *Pūja* of *Hari* with a steady mind. But now a days, *Phalāhāra* done in lieu of fasting, has assumed the form of consuming a variety of copious amounts of foods \(*Pala-Āhara*\), and so has become a thing of ridicule. In the house of a friend of mine, the mother was enquiring what the children wanted for the *Phalāhāra* for *Kṛshnāsṭami*. She was telling-“Beaten rice \(preparations\) for the father, green gram gruel for the grandmother, Raveunde for the elder brother and *Dosa* or *Roti* to me would be O.K. What shall I prepare for you my child\!” Listening to this list, the little boy said—“Mother, you have prepared a dish for each of us. Fine. But nothing for Lord *Kṛshṇa*?\!” The elders felt ashamed. Because they had forgotten that all \(preparations\) are \(meant to be offered\) to God only. The enquiry of the little boy enlightened them.

We have seen the details pertaining to fasting in the chapter of *Prathamaikādaśī*.

It should be understood that keeping awake at night is similarly a part of the *Paramātmasmaraṇa*. During *jāgaraṇa* one has to engage in prayer, *dhyāna* and *sankīrtana*. Those who cannot keep awake for the whole night, should keep awake as long as possible, and meditate upon God. The purpose of *Jāgaraṇa* at night is to keep oneself awake towards God.

*Dāna, Dakshiṇā* etc., can be offered keeping with one’s ability, either on the day of the celebration or on the day previous to it but before *Pāraṇa* to eligible persons, without any stinginess. It is best to perform *dāna* for the love of God. And if one makes a *dāna* keeping the fulfillment of desires in the mind, it is only a *sāmānyakalpa*.

Bath, *āhnika*, *brahmacarya* and keeping one’s mind clean are absolutely essential during all *Vratas*. It should be remembered that they are very much essential in this *vrata* and *Pūja* also.

The modalities of celebrating *ŚrīKṛshṇa Paramātma’s* birthday which is variously called by the names *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayanti, Janmāshṭamī* etc. are as follows:—

The most important deed to be performed that day is the worship of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Paramātma.* The forms of worship may be many based on *āgamabheda, adhikāribheda, rucibheda, deśācāra, kulācāra* etc. But the basic principle should be the sole objective—to please *Kṛshṇa*; to make him pleased with one’s mind, speech and acts; to feel one with him and experience the bliss. **“What is meant by serving *Kṛshṇa*? Prostrating before him, offering him *arghyapādya, ācamana, dhūpa, dīpa, naivedya* - this is what is meant by His *seva* - this is the general impression. Of course, it is true at one level. But the essence of that *seva* lies in attaining oneness with God. Let me give you an example. “What is meant by drinking coffee? It is not the external acts like prostrating before coffee or giving it a bath. The coffee fads say, it is sipping coffee without spilling it out and becoming one with coffee, forgetting all other things. Similarly, serving *ŚrīKṛshṇa* means taking him inside and becoming one with him and forgetting everything else completely as is evident from the line**

> “त्वां चिन्तयन् त्वन्मयतां प्रयन्नः” 

**This is what we the devotees of *Kṛshṇa* say.” - These were the words of *ŚrīRaṅgagurudeva* with a smile on his face in one of his speeches, and we emember it here with reverence.**

So, the summary of *ŚrīKṛshṇa’s Ārādhana* is, he should be meditated upon, praised and worshipped with \(*pūja*\) materials, to the best of one’s ability. If the external materials become unavailable, he can be worshipped even with *dhyāna* and *stotra* itself, and he shall be pleased. *Ārādhana* of the Lord should be done fully on that day, both at day time and night. But it is best to worship him, specially, at the exact time of his *avatāra*, i.e. at night. Even during the night, it is the time of moonrise that happens to be the significant time of His birth. There is a custom of offering special *puja* in the *Vṛshabha lagna* prior to moonrise. as a prelude to the divine event. After the main *Pūja* gets completed in the night, spending the rest of the whole night in *bhajans, Kathakīrtana, pārāyaṇa* etc is indeed the most proper use of time.

*ŚrīJayanti \(Janmāshṭamī\)* is a day of self control. The custom of remaining in his proximity, denying external food to the senses \(only\) to aid that \(divine\) state, and fasting till *pūja* gets over is prevalent. And taking his *Mahāprasāda* in the night itself is also there. Those who cannot afford to fast can have light and *sāttvik* food allowed by the *śāstras*, like fruits and milk in a limited quantity.

On that day, *Pūjamanṭap* of the Lord is decorated with pictures and *raṅgavalli* conforming to *YogaŚāstra*. And, *manṭapa* is decorated with buntings which are pleasant to the eyes, in such a way that the mind is filled with *Paramātmabhāva*. The *Pūja* pandal, which is adorned with beautiful, fragrant and juicy fruits and flowers, is called *Phalavatsāra*. Why all this arrangement?—one may ask. It is for remembering the Lord, who is described by *jnanis* as *“Paramanayanotsava Kāraṇa” “Sarvagarbha”*, *“Sarvarasa”*, *“Sarvavṛksha vanaspathi svarūpa”* etc to bring the feel of the confluence of those *vibhutis* in this *yajna* in the form of offerings to God, and to take them as *prasāda* at the end of the *Pūja*, and to obtain the *Dhātuprasannata* which is necessary for *yoga* with God. Is not Lord *Kṛshṇa* an *Alaṅkārapriya*? \(Fond of embellishments\). So, all the discipline and decorations should be made available which are needed for his *Yoga Bhoga Samrājya*. By his *saṅkalpa*, mother nature also provides the necessary materials needed for his worship. Indeed, the festival comes in a season which brims with fruits, flowers and fresh leaves caused by good rain\!

In the evening, after the bath and rituals, the *pārāyaṇa* of the story of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who adorns the holy literature such as *Śrīmadbhāgavata*, *Harivamśa, VishṇuPurāṇa* etc is done. *Pancopacāra* and *Shoḍaśopacāra* etc are offered to the Lord in keeping with one’s capacity. The *Naivedya* plentiful with \(the items viz.\) *Bhakshya, Bhojya, Choshya, lehya* and *Pānīya*, and prepared skillfully with the sentiment of devotion, are offered to the Lord. In the *Pūja* pandal of the Lord, one can see the confluence of all the flowers, leaves and fruits, as well as all food items prescribed by the *Śāstras*. These items which are dear to that glutton God are indeed the very sentiments of *Bhakti* and *Saurabha* hidden in them. In the external *pūja*, cow’s milk, *kshirānna*, *Paramānna,* beaten rise with jaggery, and butter and ginger jaggery happen to be special *naivedyās* to Him. **“Among the items of *Naivedya* the *prasāda* of ginger jaggery is a good medicine for the all round health of the devotees who take different items in the *Naivedya prasāda”*—*Śrīgurudeva* used to tell**. Lord *Kṛshṇa* who is the origin of all *Śāstras,* is worshipped with *Vedamantras*, *Śāstravākyas*, *ItihāsaPurāṇas*, *ashtottarasatas* and *sahasranamas*. *Govinda* the *Adiguru* of all arts is worshipped with *stotras* in *Sanskrit* and with dances.

“The birthday of the Lord of the worlds \(*Janmāshṭamī*\) has come available for the welfare of the world. “Let the Lord accept the special service pertaining to that”—with this *saṅkalpa* and prayers the Lord is worshipped. At the end, after the *Mahāmaṅgaḷārati*, *Arghya* is offered to the Lord and also to *Candradeva* \(the moon\), who was a witness to the birth of the Lord, who is the king of herbs, who is full of nectar and who is the incarnation of the *Manastatva* of the Lord.

“O Lord who is born in the ocean of milk, born of sage *Atri’s* eyes. I offer *arghya* to you who is accompanied by *Rohiṇi*. Please accept this and bless me.”

> क्षीरोदार्णवसम्भूत ह्यत्रिनेत्रसमुद्भव ।   
> गृहाणार्घ्यं मया दत्तं रोहिण्या सहितः शशिन् ॥ 

This is the *śloka* chanted while offering *arghya* to him.

“Lord *Nārāyaṇa* himself has incarnated in the form of *Śrī Kṛshṇa*. He took birth to kill *Kamsa*, to destroy the *Kauravās* and to protect the *Pānḍavās*, to destroy *Yādavas* and to reduce the burden on mother earth.” O Lord Kṛshṇa, you are mercy incarnate. Please provide refuge for the helpless. You are free from faults. Please accept the *arghya* I am offering to you along with mother *Devakī*.

> जातः कंसवधार्थाय भूभारोत्तरणाय च ।   
> पाण्डवानां कृतार्थाय वृष्णीनां निधनाय च॥ 

> कुरूणां च विनाशाय जज्ञे कृष्णः स्वयं हरिः ॥ 

> कृष्ण कृष्ण कृपालुस्त्वं अगतीनां गतिर्भव।   
> गृहणार्घ्यं मया दत्तं देवक्या सहितोऽनघ ॥ 

*Tithitattva, Samayamayūkha, Dharmasindhu* and some other texts have given an elaborate account of the celebration of the *parva* cited above. Among them, the *Dharmasindhu* prescribes the use of hymns both from the *Vedas* and *Purāṇas* for the worship of the Lord. In other texts, only the hymns from *Purāṇas* are found. As per *Tithitattva* and *Mayūkha*, the *Pūja Vidhis* can be summarised as follows:—

On the morning of *Janmāshṭamī* the presence of *Sūrya*, *soma*, *yama*, *kāla*, two *sandhyās*, *pañcabhūtās, ahorātrās, Vāyudeva, Dikpatis,* dwellers of *Antariksha* and *devas* should be sought with the following hymns.

> सूर्यः सोमो यमः कालः सन्ध्ये भूतान्यहः क्षपा ।   
> पवनः दिक्पतिर्भूमिराकाशं खचरामराः ॥   
> ब्राह्मं शासनमास्थाय कल्पध्वमिह सन्निधिम् । 

> आजन्ममरणं यावत् यन्मया दुष्कृतं कृतम् ।   
> तत्प्रणाशय गोविन्द प्रसीद पुरुषोत्तम॥ 

\(“O *Govinda* \! redeem me of all the sins I commit from birth to death and pardon me. *Purushottama* \! be pleased\! grace me.\)

A labour room should be built for *Devakidevi*. In that a holy *pūrṇa—kumbha*, mango leaves and garlands of flowers and *agurudhūpa* fragrance should be arranged. Auspicious decorations and *shashṭhīdevi* have to be placed there. In the room or on the outside walls, figures of *devas* and *gandharvas* with cupped hands joined together hands, *Vasudeva, Devakī, Nanda, Yasoda, Gopikās, Kamsa’s* prison guards, *Yamuna* river, *Kāliṅga Nāgas* and other pictures of *Gokula* to the extent possible should be drawn. In the afternoon, bath should be had from water mixed with gingelly and in the midnight a *saṅkalpa* should be made with the words, “I am going to worship *Śrī Kṛshṇa*, along with his retinue”. Idols of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* made of either gold or silver should be placed there, and *Prāṇapratishṭha* should be done. *Devaki Devi*, and *Śrī Kṛshṇa* being in the bed, should be meditated upon. *Lakshmīdevi*, *Devaki Vasudevas*, *Nanda, Yasoda* and *Balarāma* and *Canḍika* should be offered \(the services of\) bath, *dhūpa*, *dīpa* and *naivedya* with suitable *mantras*. The *samskārās* like *Jātakarma* and *Nāmakaraṇa* to the Lord should be felt performed sentimentally. And, at the time of moonrise, *arghya* with *Śankhatīrtha* mixed with flowers, *Kuśa* and fragrance, should be offered to *Candra* who is *Rohiṇisameta*. God should be saluted \(with *mantrās*\) and prayed as follows—”I take refuge in God to get all my desires fulfilled. I salute *Vāsudeva* the Lord of the world. You are the one who shall vanquish all the miseries. Save me from the ocean of diseases and sorrows, *Śrī Hari* \! If one prays, to you even once it is enough. You shall protect even those who are downfallen. I am a person of most vicious conduct. Please save me from the oceans of sorrows. O *Punḍarīkāksha*, am drowned in the ocean of *Māya*.

> शरणं तु प्रपद्येऽहं सर्वकामार्थसिद्धये ।   
> प्रणमामि सदा देवं वासुदेवं जगत्पतिम् ॥ 

> त्राहि मां सर्वदुःखध्न रोगशोकार्णवाद्धरे ।   
> दुर्गतांस्त्रायसे विष्णो ये स्मरन्ति सकृत् सकृत् ॥ 

> सोऽहं देवातिदुर्वृत्तः त्राहि मां शोकसागरात् ।   
> पुष्कराक्ष निमग्नोऽहं मायाविज्ञानसागरे ॥ 

Keeping awake during the whole night, the experience of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* should be had at that time from the praises and stories of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* and music etc. The next day, after the morning rituals, *ŚrīKṛshṇa* should be worshipped with *uttarārādhana* and Brāhmiṇs should be fed. With the utterance “Let *ŚrīKṛshṇa* be pleased”, they should be gifted with gold, cows, clothes etc, and the following hymn should be recited.

> यं देवं देवकीदेवी वसुदेवादजीजनत् ।   
> भौमस्य ब्रह्मणो गुप्त्यै तस्मै ब्रह्मात्मने नमः ॥ 

> सुजन्म वासुदेवाय गोब्राह्मणहिताय च ।   
> शान्तिरस्तु शिवं चास्तु \(इत्युक्त्वा तु विसर्जयेत्\) 

\(I prostrate before *Vāsudeva*, the *Parabrahmasvarūpa* the greatest *avatāra,* who does good to cows and *Brāhmiṇs*, and whom *Devakī* begot from *Vasudeva* for the protection of the *Vedas* on the earth. May peace and auspiciousness prevail.\) After this, the *Udvāsana* of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* should be performed and the idol should be gifted to a *Brāhmiṇ*. The *Vrata* should be concluded with *Pāraṇa*.

A text by name *“Kṛtyakalpataru”* says—“On the following day of *Janamāshṭamī \(Śrī Jayanti\)*, women dressed in red robes and bedecked with flower garlands should take out a procession of Lord *Kṛshṇa* in the early morning, and should go to a river or a holy tank. They should take bath there and bathe the idol of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* also. On returning home, they should consume rice cooked with jaggery, honey, pepper and barley”.

In Mahārāshṭra, a custom is followed on the following next day of *Janmotsava*. Earthern pots filled with buttermilk and curds are hung and people engage themselves in dance and singing below the pots, and make holes in them and enjoy getting drenched in the curds and buttermilk gushing from the pots. Boys especially participate in this. *Śrīmadbhāgavatam* tells us that *Gopālakas* poured curds and ghee on each other, sprinkled and anointed them on their bodies and celebrated *‘ŚrīKṛshṇa’s Janmotsava*.

> गोपाः परस्परं हृष्टाः दधिक्षीरघृताम्बुभिः ।   
> आसिञ्चन्तो विलिम्पन्तो नवनीतैश्च चिक्षिपुः ॥ 

The above said celebration of the boys in Mahārāshṭra is reminiscense of the celebration of the *Gopālakas* narrated in the *Bhāgavata*.

In South India, boys celebrate *‘Uriadi’* an auspicious function, on the following day of *Janmotsava*. Besides drenching themselves in milk, curds and buttermilk, another activity is also performed by them. Many fruits will be there in the \(pandal called\) *phalavatsara* which is hung high. The elders encouragingly announce.—“The fruits are for those who can jump high and snatch them.” Accordingly the boys jump high and grab the reachable fruits. ***ŚrīRaṅgagurudeva* had expounded the meaning of this custom in a message on the occasion of Śrī Kṛshṇajayanti as follows: “If one wishes for the great fruit which is in a lofty place beyond the three worlds, his gait should be upwards. To obtain that kind of a *Samskāra* which helps to procure such a divine fruit, one must jump high like that”. We wish to respectfully recollect those words here.**

We have discussed above some modalities in the *Pūja vidhis* to be performed on the day of *Śrī Kṛshṇa Jayanti*. We come across different *Kramas* conforming to *Śāstras* in different parts of our country viz *Saurāshṭra, Vaṅga*, Orissa and other parts. Any *krama* for that matter, which provides the divine remembrance of the *avatāra* of Lord *Kṛshṇa*, which enhances devotion to God and which brings in the accomplishment of the desires, is welcome indeed.

There are two opinions as to when should the *Pāraṇa* of the *Vrata* be done. One of the opinions is that it should be done on the following morning when both *ashṭamī* and *Rohiṇi* are past, or at least one of the two is past.

> तिथिनक्षत्रसंयोगे उपवासो यदा भवेत् ।   
> पारणं तु न कर्तव्यं यावन्नैकस्य सङ्क्षयः ॥ 

> अष्टम्यामथ रोहिण्यां न कुर्यात्पारणं क्वचित् ।   
> हन्यात् पुराकृतं कर्म उपवासार्जितं फलम् ॥ 

> तिथिरष्टगुणं हन्ति नक्षत्रं च चतुर्गुणं ।   
> तस्मात् प्रयत्नतः कुर्यात् तिथिभान्ते च पारणम् । 

The opinion that *Pāraṇa* should be done immediately after the *pūja* gets completed in the night, is also seen in the *Śāstras*.

> भक्तानां वैष्णवानां च शुद्धानां नियतात्मनाम् ।   
> विहिता सात्वताभिज्ञैः रात्रावेव तु पारणा । 

“In all types of fasting, *Pāraṇa* should be done in the morning itself. Otherwise only half the benefit will be obtained.”

		
> उपवासेषु सर्वेषु पूर्वाङ्गे पारणं भवेत् ।   
> अन्यथा तु फलस्यार्धं धर्ममेवोपसर्पति ॥ 

—We come across such strict *Śāstra Vākyas* also.

“Be it night or day, *Pāraṇa* should be done immediately after the festival”. “उत्सवान्ते च पारणम्” Such *Śāstravākyas* are also seen.

**Which of these two contradicting *Vākyas* is to be taken as authority? *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* had commanded as follows: “Both the opinions are in harmony depending on the desire of the worshipper. Those who desire for *moksha* along with dharma, *artha* and *kāma*, fast through the day and do *Pāraṇa* the next morning. Those who perform the *parva* for the sole purpose of *moksha* who perform utsava for the love of God can have *Pāraṇa* that very night itself. Such people need not wait till *candrodaya* and can finish *Pūja* earlier. *NishiPāraṇa* is forbidden for them”. We wish to humbly remember this here.**

There is also a custom of completing the *Vrata* after the *Pāraṇa* by chanting the hymn “ॐ भूताय, भूतेश्वराय, भूतपतये, भूतसम्भवाय गोविन्दाय नमो नमः” \(Saluations to that *Govinda* who is *Sarvabhūtasvarūpi*, master of the *bhūtas*, and cause of all creation,\). We would like to conclude this article on *Śrī Kṛshṇa Janmotsava* with *Govindapraṇāma smṛtis*.





	 
## Kṛttikā Dīpotsava \(Śivadīpa Vishṇudīpa Mahotsavas\)

### 1. Names of the *parvas*

We see many *Dīpotsava parvas* in the line of festivals of *Bhāratīyas* where rows of lamps are lighted in temples, homes, *maṭhas*, *Āśramas* and *Mandirs*, both inside and outside those places. The most famous *parvas* among these are the *Vishṇu dīpa* and *Śiva dīpa* \(*Mahotsavas*\).

These two fall either on the same day or one of them comes on the next day of the other, and thus they declare the deep relationship of *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*, to the sentimental devotees. These are also called by the name *laksha dīpotsava* in the temples. The *laksha dīpotsavas* of *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* and their *parivāra devatās* are observed on the full moon day of *kārtika māsa*, or *Kṛshṇa caturdaśī* or on the day of *amāvāsya tithi* of *kārtika māsa*. However in most of the places, these *Śiva*-*Vishṇu Dīpotsava*s are celebrated only in the *vṛścika māsa* of the solar calendar. Though these festivals happen to fall some times in *kārtika māsa* and at other times in *mārgaśira māsa* as per the lunar calendar, they are celebrated only in the month which is called *‘kārtikai māsam’* in the Tamil country as per the solar calendar, and importance is given to *kṛttikā Nakshatra* also in the observance of this festival. Therefore these *Śiva-Vishṇu Dīpotsava*s are also called *‘kṛttikā dīpotsava’* or *‘tirukkārtikai’*.

### 2. The Day and Time of observance.

Though it is stipulated to be observed in the month of *Vṛścika*, the special day and time at which is should be observed in that month, needs to be known by discussion.

*Śiva Dīpotsava* should be observed in the month of *Vṛścika* on the day when there is the presence of *kṛttikā Nakshatra*. If it happens to be on a Monday, it is auspicious. It is best if there are no *doshas* such as eclipse or *saṅkramaṇa*. The worship with lighting of lamps is done in the evening or at night. The following facts are to be noted regarding the day and time of observance of *Vishṇu Dīpotsava*.

1. The day of *Pūrṇimā* in the month of *Vṛścika* is important. It is auspicious if *kṛttikā Nakshatra* also happens to be there on that day. It is better if there is no *vedha* of *caturdaśī* and star *bharaṇi*, and the *yoga* of Tuesday. And the general rule is that the day should be free from *doshas* of *saṅkramaṇa* and eclipse. The festival worship should be done in *vṛshabha lagna*. 
2. Even if it is *śuddha Pūrṇimā* it should be given up, if there is *vedha* of star *bharaṇi*, and the festival should be observed on the following day \(i.e. in *Prathamā*\) *when the yoga of kṛttikā Nakshatra* prevails even to the extent of one *kalā*. 
3. Similarly, if there is *vedha* of *Caturdaśi* on the day of *Pūrṇimā*, it should be given up even if there the *yoga* of pure *Kṛttikā Nakshatra*, and it should be observed on the following day only, when the *yoga* of *Pūrṇimā* prevails even to the extent of one *kalā*. 
4. If, on the previous or the next day, there happens to be the *vedha* of *bharaṇi Nakshatra* on *kṛttikā* star, and the *vedha* of *caturdaśī* on *Pūrṇimā* respectively, then the festival should be celebrated either at the end of that month or in the beginning of the next month, when a *kalā* of pure *kṛttikā Nakshatra* or pure *Pūrṇimā* prevails. 
5. If either pure \(*Pūrṇimā*\) or *kṛttikā* star do not prevail in the previous day and the next day, then the festival should be observed on \(*Pūrṇimā* itself\) inspite of the *Vedha*. 
6. Similarly, if there is the *dosha* of eclipse or *saṅkramaṇa*, the festival should not be observed on those days. It should be observed on a blemishless day, either at the beginning or that end of the month. 
7. If an auspicious day is available in both the beginning of the month and at the end of the month, the festival should be observed on the latter day itself, as per the rule *“uttare deva kāryāṇi’*. 
8. If both the days have *saṅkramaṇa* or other *doshas*, the festival should be celebrated on the day which has *kṛttikā nakshatra* conjoined with *sampūrṇaPūrṇimā parva* 
9. Even if the day does not have the *yoga* of *sampūrṇa Pūrṇimā tithi*, the *parva* should be observed on the latter day. 
10. If, either the previous day or the following day of the festival happens to be a Tuesday, or if the beginning or the end of the month happens to be a Tuesday, then such days should be given up, and the festival should be observed on some other day which is pure. 
11. If no other auspicious day is available, then it should be observed on the pure Tuesday itself. 
12. Among the two days i.e. the day with *Vedha* and the day with *dosha* of *saṅkramaṇa* and eclipse, the second one is better than the first. *Saṇkramaṇa doshas* are taken into consideration only if they prevail during the day time or before midnight in the night. 
13. The *doshas* of eclipse and *saṅkramaṇas* are not taken into consideration if they prevail after midnight. 
14. If pure *Pūrṇimā* occurs on either the beginning day or the ending day of the month and happens to be united with *Rohiṇi Nakshatra*, and, if *prathamā* is united with \(pure\) *kṛttikā Nakshatra*, then the festival should be observed on the latter day. But if eclipse, and/or *saṅkramaṇa* occur on that day, then the observance of the festival shall be on the former day only. 
15. If on account of the extension of *Pūrṇimā tithi* and the *kṛttikā* star, the *yoga* of those two i.e. the pure *tithi* and *Nakshatra* extends from the previous day to a small extent on the following day, then the day of celebration shall be on that day, when the duration of *kṛttikā* star is more. 
16. If that *yoga* happens to be equal on both the days, or, less on one day, then the festival should be observed on the previous day itself. 

1. The festival of lights should be celebrated on the day of *Dīpotsava* during the time between 48 minutes to sunset \(one *muhūrta*\) and one half of a *yāma* \(ninety minutes\) after sunset. 2. As the *vrishabha lagna* is prescribed for the time of observance of festival, *Dīpotsava* should be observed after sunset on the beginning day of the month. If the festival day is in the middle of the month or at the end of the month, the festival should be observed before sunset. If the festival is to be observed like this before sunset, *sandhyāvandana* etc should be done after sunset. But if the festival of lights is to be observed after sunset, *sandhyāvandana* should be finished before sunset.

### 3. The method of observation of the festival:

Though *Dīpotsava* is celebrated either in the evening or at night, the whole day is indeed a festival day. On that day, God should be worshipped specially with purity and abundance of the *trikaraṇas* and materials, and the worship should be conducted in the afternoon also. If there is a shortage of materials externally speaking, the abundance of the proper *manodharma* will make up for the shortage.

There is also a custom among some people, where women worship *‘Gajalakshmī’* at an auspicious time either early in the morning or in the afternoon. Worship is performed to the idol of an elephant made of either clay or gold, silver and other metals, with *dīpa, dhūpa* and the *naivedya* of rice, jaggery, *dūrvā grass*, and *ārati*. After offering worship to the invoked deity in the idol of the elephant on the day of festival, the next day at morning and night, and the following day in the morning, the idol of the elephant in clay is given a send off on the afternoon of the last day by bidding good bye with devotion and faith in some garden, with the sentiment “शोभनार्थं पुनरागमनाय च” \(“O great Mother, auspicious form, please arrive again for the worship of the next year”\). All the family members, relatives and friends join together and partake the *prasāda* of various cooked rice items mixed with different ingredients which have been offered as *naivedya* to God. If the third day happens to be a Tuesday or a Friday, then the send off worship is performed on Wednesday or Saturday. \(Some people perform the special worship of *‘mahālakshmī’* on Thursdays and the worship of *‘gajagauri’* on *ashṭami tithi* of the dark half of *bhādrapada*.

Special *dīpārādhana* is offered of God in the evenings and nights, in temples, homes, *maṭhas* and *āśramas*.

Rows of lamps are lighted, beginning from the *pūja* room in many places, ie both inside and outside the house, on thresholds, on the upper and lower levels of the house, on walls and on the top of the wells and niches in the walls. And lamps are lighted the following day on the top of a heap of dirt also. \(Tamils call this day *“Kuppai kārtikai”*\). We see the custom of chanting *Sahasranāma* of God and preparing wick lamps simultaneously, and lighting them in a row, especially in the temples in Kerala.

After having a bath in the evening and entering the *pūja* room, and making a *saṅkalpa* that worship of God which is a part of *Dīpotsava* shall be done, and after the service of *Dhūpa* and *dīpa*, special *naivedya* of puffed rice, flattened rice etc should be offered. A lamp should be lighted from the lighted lamp in the *pūja* room, and from that other lamps should be lighted in a row. The *Mahānirājana* should be performed to God with different *dīpa pātras* such as *Ekārathi, Pañcārati, Pañcāśadārati, Catushtashṭyārati, Cakrārati*, and *Kumbhārathi* etc, chanting *Rudrasūkta, rudragāyatri*, *Vishṇusūkta* and *Vishṇu Gāyatri* etc related to the respective deities. There is a custom of chanting the following *mantra* from *‘nakshatreshṭi’* related to *‘Agni Devatā’* at the time of *Mahāmaṅgaḷārati*

अग्निर्नः पातु कृत्तिकाः । नक्षत्रं देवमिन्द्रियम्। इदमासां विचक्षणम् । हविरासञ्जुहोतन । यस्य भान्ति रश्मयो यस्य केतवः । यस्येमा विश्वा भुवनानि सर्वा । स कृत्तिकाभिरभिसंवसानः । अग्निर्नो देवस्सविते दधातु ॥

After the offering of *mahā maṅgalārati* with the chanting of this *mantra* which sings the praise of *Agnideva* who is the reigning deity of *kṛttikā Nakshatra*, and also the praise of the *paramātma*n who is the form of effulgent light, who is *antaryāmī* in *Agni*, and who exists within the *agnimaṅdala* and who is referred to as *Agni*, one more special rite is observed in temples on that day. The rite is - A piece of white cloth is soaked in ghee and wrapped around the end of a \(wooden\) stick and lighted from the burning flame of either the *Nīrājana* or the fire from the burning flame of the lamp lighted in front of God, and is burnt. Its *masi* \(ash-soot\) considered as a *Rakshā* is first applied to the forehead of God, and then its *Prasāda* is taken by all the devotees and is applied to their foreheads.

### 4. The significance of the time of observance:-

As we have noted before, *kṛttikā dīpotsava* \(*Śiva dīpa* and *Vishṇu dīpa* festivals\) come in the month of *Kārtika* or *mārgaśira*. Both these months are best for the development of divine knowledge and accomplishment of auspiciousness. “कार्तिके ज्ञानवृद्धिस्स्यात् मार्गशीर्षे शुभोदयः” Among these two, the month of *kārtika* is a very dear month to Lord *Śiva*, the one who grants divine knowledge, as is evident from “ज्ञानं महेश्वरादिच्छेत्”. We have already described in the chapter on the festivals of the month of *Kārtika*, that Mondays of the *kārtika māsa* are very best for the worship of *Śiva*. So, there is no doubt that a Monday occurring in *Kārtika* is best for the observance of *Śiva dīpa Utsava*. This period of time is called the time of *Jnānavṛddhi*, and the time dear to *Mahādeva* the dispenser of divine knowledge, as it is conducive to the blossoming of the centers of *Ātmajnāna* by the grace of Mother Nature. As evident from the words “ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते” declared in the *Gīta*, even though it is a month dear to *Nārāyaṇa* the dispenser of \(divine\) knowledge, it is most dear to Lord *Śiva* also. \(The *śrāvaṇa māsa* is exceptionally dear to Lord *Vishṇu*\).

*Śrī Kṛshṇa paramātma* himself has proclaimed the glory of *mārgaśiramāsa*. *“māsanām mārgaśīrshoham’*. He has declared that it is his superior most glory.

1\) The *śāstras* say “This is a part of the time that comes in between the *dakshiṇāyana* which is the night of the *devatās* and *uttarāyaṇa* which is the day of *devatās*, and being in the *‘brāhmīmuhūrta’* it happens to be a limb of time which is *sattvonmeshaka*. It is also the of meeting time of the *devatās* and the *pitṛs*. One should be awake and do meditation and worship of God”.

> ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते देवानां पितृणां च समागमः ।  
> जागरस्तत्र कर्तव्यो देवसंमाननं हि तत् ॥ 

Just as *devatās* are pleased with worship during this period of time, the *pitṛs* also are pleased by the performance of the *navāgrayaṇa* worship.

		
2\) This is the period of time abundant with cow’s milk and rich with flush vegetation and others and is highly conducive to both the inner path and the outer path to God.

3\) There is no doubt in the fact that the new year would start from *Mārgaśirshā* itself, which is evident from the words

“आदाय मार्गशीर्षादि द्वौ द्वौ मासौ ऋतुर्मतः” \(कात्यायन\) “मार्गादीनां युगैः क्रमात्” \(*amarakosha*\),—as quoted by elders.

3\) The *Pūrṇimā* of this month during which the star *‘mṛgaśīrsha’* which is called the *yajnaśiras* is near the full moon, is indeed most auspicious for the worship of *Nārāyaṇa Parañjyoti* who is *Yajnarūpi* and the dispenser of the fruits of *Yajnas*.

*Paramātma* is *Parañjyotisvarūpa*. By lighting the lamp which represents HIM, the *Sanātana Ārya Maharshis* who had the divine sentiment of lighting the entire world, brought forth an auspicious tradition to the world, where, from the lamp that was lighted first, they have lighted other lamps which represent the fourteen *vidyās* and the sixty four arts. It is indeed natural that they celebrated this great festival where a thousands of lamps are lighted. This *parañjyoti* is renowned as *Nārāyaṇa* in the *Vedas*.

“नारायण परोज्योतिरात्मा नारायणः परः   
> स हि देवः परं ज्योतिः तमसः परमुच्यते“ 

This saying praises *Śiva* as the *Parañjyoti*. As evident from the words

> हृदयकमलमध्ये दीपवद्वेदसारम्  
> हरिगुरुशिवयोगं सर्वभूतस्थमेकम्, 

the origin of both *Nārāyaṇa* and *SadāŚiva*, is from the form of *parañjyothi* only, \(and so\), it is proper indeed to worship both of them by the names *Śiva dīpa* and *Vishṇu dīpa* during these months, which encourages the urge for divine knowledge. The worship of both of them on the same day or the next day, proclaims their unique relationship. *kṛttikā nakshatra* is also best for the worship of Lord *Kārtikeya*.

Why should a lighted lamp be placed on the heap of garbage? The answer is, the whole universe is filled with the effulgence of *Nārāyaṇa* and the same light is shining behind the heap of garbage also. This custom reminds the *tattva* “नारायण एवेदं सर्वम्”

### 5. Why do they worship *‘Gajalakshmī’* ?

The tradition of women worshipping the idol of an elephant on the morning of *Vishṇu dīpotsava* has been mentioned earlier. “Why should the idol of an elephant be worshipped? Instead, giving rice, jaggery and coconut to a live elephant makes it and happy, and it may even serve us. Why should the clay idol of it be worshipped? Perhaps long ago people were very much troubled by the elephants. So, the custom arose from a blind faith that by worshipping its earthern image, they may escape from their menace.”—This is the guess of some. Even though this guesswork appears correct superficially, in reality it is not correct. This custom of worship was brought by *Yogis* who were *jnānis*. They call that elephant by the name *‘Gajalakshmī’*. And some say—“Like *Dhanalakshmī*, *Dhānyaakshmī* and *Ashṭa lakshmī*, elephants are also a wealth that are useful for the worldly life. So *Gajalaksmi* means the wealth of elephants, and a large number of superior elephants”. But comment also is not correct. Because not everyone will have the capacity to get elephants and bring them up and obtain service from them. It is difficult even for the kings. So, how can it be possible for ordinary people then? *Yogis* visualise elephants in the inner spiritual center of the body called *‘gajakunḍa’*. Not only this. *Yogasādhakas* visualize the divine elephants in the retinue of *Śrīdevi* which they behold just before the attainment of the divine *ambrosia*, in their *Dhyānamanthana* for the attainment of *Brahmānanda*. As they are great powers that carry \(bear\) the universe on their backs, they are called *‘Diggajas’* by the sages, in the wordly language. \(In reality, if the earth is dug no such elephants can be found. One should not be deluded by interpreting things pertaining to the inner vision of the sages in the physical plane.\) *Purāṇās* and *Śrī Sūktis* of the *ācāryas* proclaim that these divine great elephants perform the *Divyānandāmṛta—Abhisheka* to the *Jaganmāta*.

> दिग्गजा हेमपात्रस्थमादाय विमलं जलम् ।  
> स्नापयाक्रिरे देवीं सर्वलोकमहेश्वरी म् ॥ \(विष्णुपुराण 19-103\) 

> पुष्पासारस्थगितभुवनैः पुष्कलावर्तकाद्यैः  
> क्लप्तारम्भाः कनककलशैरभ्यषिन् गजेन्द्राः श्रीवेदान्तदेशिक-श्रीस्तुति, श्लोक 13\) 

These elephants are divine powers that belong to the retinue of *Lakshmīdevī* and are *amśas* of *Lakshmī*. They are *Tattva Viśeshās. Yogis* visualize them in the form of divine elephants. They are also called *‘Lakshmī’*, as they are divine *amśas* of *Lakshmī devī*. One should clearly understand that their worship is a part of the worship of *Lakshmī* herself.

In Sanskrit language an elephant is also called *“Sāmaja’* \(born of *Sāma Veda*\)

> हस्ताभ्यां परिगृह्याथ सप्त सामान्यगायत ।  
> गायतो ब्रह्मणस्तस्मात् समुत्पेतुर्मतङ्गजाः \(पालकाख्य\) 

These divine elephants emerged when *Prajāpati Brahmadeva* sang the *sapta sāmas*. The elephants seen in the external world have some similarities in shape with those of the divine elephants visualized by *jnānis*, and so the elephants came to be called *‘sāmaja’* in the wordly parlance. There is similarity in the shape of the divine elephants with the elephants seen in the external world. Also, when the external elephants trumpet, the roar will be in harmony with the *Nishāḍa Śruti* of the *Sāmaveda*.

Though women worship the clay idol of an external elephant, the objective of that worship is the divine elephants i.e. the-*sāmajas*, which are *amśas* of *Mahālakshmī*. It is not the worship of a mere elephant; It is the worship of *Gajalakashmī*. For example, the salutation to the Indian flag is not a salutation to the cloth. It is the salutation to the goddess of the nation indicated by the cloth. The worship of the idol of *Gajalakshmī* at distinct times will help in the inner vision of *Gajalakshmī* \(*tāttvika Gajalakshmī*\) and *Mahālakshmī*, the proprietress of those *Gajalakshmīs*.

One should not make a narrow minded criticism such as—“This worship of *Gajalakshmī* is of recent origin. It belongs only to a certain tradition.” In the *purāṇas* we come across the story that queen *Gāndhari* worshipped a clay idol of *Gajalakshmī*. But *Kuntī devī* had the good fortune of worshipping *Airāvata* itself by making it descend from the heavens, which became possible by the valour and devotion to God of her great sons *Bhīma* and *Arjuna*. Worshipping of *Gajarāja* is also there and there is worship to *Gajalakshmī* also, who is the form of his feminine *śakti*.

Since there exists a sentiment that the idols of elephants which are worshipped are the form of *Lakshmī*, their *Visarjana* is not done on Tuesdays and Fridays. Isn’t it that the female members of the family are not sent \(to another place\) on those days? Then how can it be acceptable to perform the send off of *Gajalakshmī* on those days?

### 6. Why should a cloth be burnt on the *Dīpotsava* at night?

We have discerned earlier that the religious rite of soaking a piece of cloth in ghee and burning it is a part of the worship of the *Dīpotsava* of the night. What is the spirit behind this ?

Some may ask-“ can’t that piece of cloth be given to the poor instead of burning like that? Instead of wasting so much ghee for soaking the cloth, can’t it not be used as food? Can’t it be given to the poor”? It is really appreciable if they have a genuine concern in gifting cloth and ghee to the poor. It would indeed be a matter of great happiness, if they give such great gifts to the deserving persons and also inspire others for doing the same.

		
But, the problem of the poor in the world will not be solved \(just by saving\) a piece of cloth and a small \(measure\) of ghee. Instead, it will be commendable to think of religious and monetary schemes to provide solution to that problem.

According to tradition, the burning of apiece of cloth in the above ritual is symbolic of the destruction of *tripurāsura* by Lord *Śiva* for the welfare of the world, and, it is good if the cloth has three colors viz. black, red and white. It has been described in scriptures that *Tripurāsuras* are the embodiments of *triguṇas-tamas, rajas* and *sattva*, from the *tāttvik* point of view. The *tamas, rajas* and *sattva* \(*guṇas*\) are associated with the colors of black, red and white respectively. These are three cities which are always in constant motion. These are the three *guṇas* which always roam in the *samsāra* and make \(other beings also\) to roam without peace or refuge.

In the worldly life these three \(*guṇas*\) will never come to harmony. But when a *mahāyogi* achieves the harmony of those during *Samādhi*, they perish. All the *purāṇas* describe the \(*tāttvika*\) story that the great Lord of *yoga, Mahādeva SadāŚiva*, who is beyond the three *guṇas* attained that state and destroyed the three cities. The above ritual of burning the cloth is a delightful way to proclaim this divine *tattva* to the world. As God burnt the three demons of the three *guṇas*, the *śesha prasāda* \(remains of the sacred ash as consecrated *prasāda*\) is a protection to the world. So, wearing the mark of that as *prasāda* first, is indeed most proper.

The *Śivapurāṇa* describes the chariot and other materials used in that destruction of the three demons as follows- The divine chariot which was mounted by *Śiva*, was full of all the *devatās*. It was constructed for the \(welfare\) of the world.

> सर्वदेवमयं दिव्यं रथं परमशोभनम् ।  
> रचयामास विश्वार्थे विश्वकर्मा तदास्थया ॥ 

It is a divine chariot consisting of all the worlds and all the creatures. It’s right wheel is the sun, and the moon is the left wheel. The twelve spokes of the right wheel are the twelve *ādityas*. The sixteen spokes of the left wheel are the sixteen *kalās* of the moon. The twenty seven stars are the embellishments of that wheel. The six seasons are the rims of the two wheels. The sky is the blade of the sword and the *mandara* mountain is its shed. The year is its speed. The *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana* are the meeting place of the two wheels. The *muhūrta* is the pole or the shaft of the chariot. The *kalās* are the stakes or pointed wooden pegs of the yoke. The subtle divisions of time like *kalā* and *kāshṭhā* are the nose of the chariot. *Ahaṅkāra* is the corners of the chariot. *Bhūtas* form its strength. The senses are the embellishments of the chariot. The fourteen places of knowledge \(*vidyā sthānas*\) and the rules of observances are the ornaments of the chariot. The *Gaṅgā* and other sacred rivers served the Lord of the chariot by fanning with *cāmaras*. Goddess *Sarasvati* was the bell of the bow. *Ādiśesha* was the ropes of the chariot. Lord *Vishṇu*, was the arrow of the bow. *Agni* was the sharp tip of the arrow. The four *Vedas* were the horses of the chariot. *Brahma deva* was the charioteer. Whatever was present in the cosmos was there in that chariot. \(*Śiva purāṇa Rudra samhitā*, 8 th chapter\). Who else can the *tripurāsūras* be other than the three *guṇa*s, who were slain by *Maheśvara* the *mahāttvasārvabhauma*, sitting in this chariot which was *tattvamaya*?

> सर्वलोकमयो दिव्यो रथो यत्नेन सादरम् ।  
> सर्वभूतमयश्चैव सौवर्णस्सर्वसम्मतः ॥ 

> रथाङ्गं दक्षिणं सूर्यस्तद्वामं सोम एव च।  
> अरेषु तेषु विप्रेन्द्र आदित्या द्वादशैव तु ॥ 

शशिनष्षोडशारास्तु कला वामस्य सुव्रत।  
> यक्षाणि तु तथा तस्य वामस्यैव विभूषणम् ॥ 

> वेगस्संवत्सरास्तस्य अयने चक्रसङ्गमौ ।  
> मुहूर्ता बन्धुरास्तस्य शम्याश्चैव कलाः स्मृताः ॥ 

> इन्द्रियाणि च तस्यैव भूषणानि समेततः ।  
> पुराणन्यायमीमांसाधर्मशास्त्राणि सुव्रताः॥ 

अधोबन्धो ह्यनन्तस्तु सहस्रफणभूषितः ।  
> गङ्गाद्यास्सरितः श्रेष्ठाः सर्वाभरणभूषिताः ॥ 

> चामरासक्तहस्तास्ताः सर्वाः स्त्रीरूपशोभिताः ।  
> सारथिर्भगवान् ब्रह्मा देवा रश्मिधराः स्मृताः ॥ 

> घण्टा सरस्वती देवी धनुषः श्रुतिरूपिणी ।  
इषुर्विष्णुर्महातेजाः अग्निश्शल्यं प्रकीर्तितम् ॥ 

> हयास्तस्य तथा प्रोक्ताः चत्वारो निगमा मुने ।  
> ब्रह्माण्डे चैव यत्कीत् वस्तु तद्वै रथे स्मृतम् ॥ 

Thus, the custom of burning the tricolored cloth and wearing its sacred ash over the forehead to remind onself of the divine story of Lord *Mahādeva*, who, sitting in the divine chariot along with the divine paraphernalia killed the *tripurāsuras* representing the *triguṇas*, is indeed a highly influential custom. It is appropriate for this custom to be performed on *Śiva Dīpotsava*, because *Śiva* is famously known as the slayer of the three cities. But the question raises as to why should this practice be observed during the *Vishṇu dīpotsava*? But if one studies the story of the *purāṇas* in full, the necessity of observing it on *Vishṇu dīpa pūja* also becomes clear. Because Lord *Vishṇu* has an important place in the *Tripurasamhāra* with that of *Śiva* also. *Śiva* destroyed the three demons \(cities\) by the weapon called *Nārāyaṇa* “नारायणेनास्त्रिणे” “स आशुगो विष्णुमयो वह्नितुल्यो महाज्वलन् । ददाह त्रिपुरान्तस्थान्. . . ॥ ” It was *Vishṇu* in the form of a great bull, who held \(firm\) the divine chariot that was sinking.

> वृषेन्द्ररूपी चोत्थाय स्थापयामास वै क्षणम् ।  
> स्थापयामास देवस्य वचनाद्वै रथं वरम् ॥ \(शिव-रुद्रसं 9-10\) 

Even though the *asuras* were killed in the battle, they were taking birth again and again by the touch of the *ambrosia* which was in the well of *Amṛtarasa*. Lord *MahāVishṇu* assumed the form of a cow and drank all the ambrosia in the well. Then it became impossible for the demons to regain their lives.

> तदायं भगवान् विष्णुः तत्रोपायमकल्पयत् ।  
> प्रविश्य त्रिपुरं काले रसकूपामृतं पपौ ॥ \(भागवत 7-10-62\) 

Thus, it is indeed proper to observe the ritual of the burning of the cloth which represents the *Tripuradahana* in *Vishṇu Dīpotsava*, as *Vishṇu* the god beyond the *triguṇa*s also had a main role in the sport of *tripurasamhāra*, where \(the *tripuras*\) symbolize the three *guṇa*s.

Thus, the *kṛttikā dīpotsava* which is a form of *Dīpotsava* of *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*, is the glorious form of the great worship of \(*paramātma*\), who is the origin of all *jyotis*, the whole and soul of the all containing and omnipresent, as said in ज्योतिषामपि तज्जोतिः While the morning *pūja* is the worship of the glory of *Śrīmahalakshmī* the divine consort of *parabrahma*, the evening and night worship prides itself in the form of a great festival which brings out the grandeur of the supreme *Purusha*.





	 
## Mahāśivarātri

*Mahāśivarātri* is one of the most important *parvas* among the festivals of *Bhāratīyas*. Just as *Prayāga* and *Pushkara* are called *‘Tīrtharāja’*, *Mahāśivarātri* is called *‘vratarāja’*. This *vrata* is observed in all parts of *Bhāratadeśa* with concern reverence and devotion.

Though this is a festival where the prominent deity is *Śiva* and a very special *parva* for *śaivites*, even *Vaishṇavas* and worshippers of other great *devatās* also should specially worship God \(*Śiva*\) on *Śivarātri*. *Śāstras* say that those who are indifferent to *Śivarātri* i.e. those who turn away from it without observing it, and those who abstain from doing worship in the *Antarmukha* state but remain *Bahirmukhas,* happen to lose all the benefits of worship and become unfortunate.

> शैवो वा वैष्णवो वाऽपि यो वा स्यादन्यपूजकः ।   
> सर्वं पूजाफलं हन्ति शिवरात्रिबहिर्मुखः” 

\(Whether it is a *Śaiva* or a *Vaishṇava* or a devotee of any other God, if one keeps indifferent to *Śivarātri*, he will lose all the benefits of worship\).

Every *Kṛshṇa Caturdaśi* in the entire year is dear to Lord *Śiva* and is called *‘Śivarātri’*. Among them, the *caturdaśī* of the month of *Māgha* is most special, and so it is called *‘Mahāśivarātri’* As in *Ekādaśī*, in the observance of this *vrata* also, fasting is an important part and so it is also called ‘The festival of fasting’. Generally, nights are not auspicious for the worship of *devatās*. But on *Śivarātri*, the whole night is specified as auspicious for God’s worship, and so the name *‘Śivarātri’* also suits this. All the four *yamas* of the night are very auspicious for the worship of God.

*Śāstra*s and traditions loudly proclaim the great glory of the *Śivarātri vrata*.

This festival of observance of *Śivarātri* is the best among all the *yajnas*. None of these i.e. *dāna, yajna*, penance, a place of holywater, *vrata*s and *karmas* can equal even a ten millionth part of the *Śivarātri vrata*.

> शिवरात्रिरिति ख्याता सर्वयज्ञोत्तमोत्तमा ।   
> दानयज्ञतपस्तीर्थव्रतकर्माणि यानि च   
> शिवरात्रिव्रतस्यापि कोट्यंशे न समानि च॥ 

We come across such words of praise with regard to other *vrata*s as well. They are called *‘Arthavāda’* i.e. their purpose is only to emphasise the importance of those *vrata*s. It should not be understood that other *vrata*s are inferior and that this *vrata* alone is superior. Even then, prominence to *Śivarātri* is very much there, because of the significance of the distinct time and the superiority of the availability of abundant time for worship and *dhyāna*.

The *Garuḍa Purāṇa* proclaims that if one observes fast and keeps vigil during the night, and performs worship on this day of *Kṛshṇa caturdaśī* that comes between the months of *Māgha* and *Phālguṇa*, *Rudradeva* will bestow both *bhukti* and *Mukti,* and redeems him from hell.

> माघफाल्गुणयोर्मध्ये कृष्णा या तु चतुर्दशी ।   
> तस्यां जागरणाद्रुद्रः पूजितो भुक्तिमुक्तिदः ॥   
> उपोषितैः पूजितस्सन्नरकात्तारयेत्तथा” \(गरुड पुराण  I-124\) 

“It removes all sins. One who observes fast and keeps vigil through the night and worships *Śiva* with the leaves of *bilva* in all the four *yāmas* of the night will become equal to *Śiva* himself”.

> कृतोपवासा ये तस्यां शिवमर्चन्ति जाग्रताः।   
> बिल्वपत्रैश्चतुर्यामं ते यान्ति शिवतुल्यताम्” 

Those who worship thus will have no rebirths..

मातुः पयोधररसं न पिबेत् स कदाचन”

Those who do not worship *Śiva* the Lord of the three worlds on that occasion, are poor creatures. They wander through thousands of lives.

> न पूजयति भक्त्येशं रुद्रं त्रिभुवनेश्वरम् ।   
> जन्तुर्जन्मसहस्रेषु भ्रमते नात्र संशयः ॥ 

All people i.e. men, women and people belonging to all *varṇas* and all castes must observe this *vrata*.

> वर्षे वर्षे महादेवि नरो नारी पतिव्रता ।   
> शिवरात्रौ महादेवं कामं भक्त्या प्रपूजयेत् ॥ 

> शिवरात्रिव्रतं नाम सर्वपापप्रणाशनम् ।   
> आचण्डालमनुष्याणां भुक्तिमुक्तिप्रदायकम् ॥ 

Like *ŚrīKṛshṇajayantī* and *Janmāshṭamī vrata*s, *Mahāśivarātri* is also both a *nityavrata* and a *kāmyavrata*. It is stated that this may be observed by people who desire the four-fold values of life, and also that people who do not observe this *vrata* will be incurring sin. And so, this is both a *Nitya* and a *Kāmya vrata*.

This is a sacred *vrata* which should be instructed only to a person who is *ātmaguṇasampanna* and who is pure both in body and mind. A preceptor\) who initiates this *vrata* to a person who does not possess the above qualifications, will go to hell.

> अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोधो ब्रह्मचर्यं दया क्षमा   
> शान्तात्मा क्रोधहीनश्च तपस्वी ह्यनसूयकः । 

> तस्मै देयमिदं देवि गुरुपादानुगो यदि   
> अन्यथा यो ददातीदं स तदा नरकं व्रजेत्॥ 

If one observes the *vrata* on that day, all the sins committed in the entire year will get redeemed. On that day, all the *liṅgas* both moveable and immoveable, will have the special *sānnidhya* of Lord *Śiva*.

> लिङ्गेषु च समस्तेषु चलेषु स्थावरेषु च ।   
> सङ्क्रमिष्याम्यसान्दिग्धं वर्षपापविशुद्धये॥ 

### The great glory of *Mahāśivarātri*

*ŚivaPurāṇa* describes the great glory of *Śivarātri* as follows:-*“Mondays, Kṛshṇapaksha, Ashṭamī* and *Caturdaśī* are the ones which undoubtedly cause delight to *Śiva*. Among these four, the *Śivarātri* \(i.e. the *Kṛshṇa Caturdaśī*\) is most auspicious. Those who desire *Bhukti* and *Mukti* must necessarily observe this *vrata*.”

> सोमवारः कृष्णपक्षः अष्टमी च चतुर्दशी ।   
> शिवतुष्टिकरं चैतन्नात्र कार्या विचारणा ॥ 

> चतुर्ष्वपि बलिष्ठं शिवरात्रिव्रतं हरे ।   
> तस्मात्तदेव कर्तव्यं भुक्तिमुक्तिफलेप्सुभिः ॥ 

There is no other *vrata* which is better than this, that brings in great benefit to \(human beings\). This is an excellent *vrata* which may be observed by all for the attainment of *dharma*. All people, be it *nishkāmas* or *sakāmas*, should observe this *vrata*. This is a *vrata* that can be observed by people of all *Varṇas* and *Aśramas*, women, boys, servants and maids, *devatās* and all people who bear a body, for prosperity.

> एतस्माच्च व्रतादन्यत् नास्ति नृणां हितावहम् ।   
> एतद्व्रतं तु सर्वेषां धर्मसाधनमुत्तमम् ।   
> निष्कामानां सकामानां सर्वेषां च नृणां तथा ।   
> वर्णानामाश्रमाणां च स्त्रीबालानां तथा हरे ।   
> दासानां दासिकादीनां देवादीनां तथैव च।   
> शरीरिणां च सर्वेषां हितमेतद् व्रतं वरम् ॥ \(कोटिरुद्रसंहिता, अध्याय 38\) 

This is the great day when *Brahma* and *Vishṇu* worshipped *Śiva* in *Arunācala*. *Śiva* was pleased with the *pūja*, and named this day which became dear to him as *‘Śivarātri’* and granted the following boon to this great day as follows:- “The one who on this day observes afast, keeps vigil through the night, restrains the senses, and worships *Śiva* in an idol or a *Liṅga* honestly and to the best of his ability, will obtain the benefit equivalent to the worship performed for the whole year. Just as the time of moonrise causes waxing of the sea, *Śivarātri* increases the *Śivadharma* in a person”

> तुष्टोऽहमद्य मां वत्स पूजयास्मिन् महादिने ।   
> दिनमेतत्ततः पुण्यं भविष्यति महत्तरम् ॥

\(विद्येश्वरसंहिता - अधायाय 8\) 

If fast is observed on *Śivarātri* knowingly or unknowingly, or for any other reason, the mind gets purified. There are several stories which shower praises, say that if a person causes the *bilva* leaf to fall on *Śivaliṅga* and gives the *Śivaliṅga* a holy bath with pure water even unknowingly, he will obtain *mahāpurushārthasiddhi*. Among them, the story of *Beḍarakaṇṇappa* is very famous. The flood of devotion flowed in the *Śivānandalahari Stotra* composed by *Śrī Śankarabhagavatpāda* based on the story below, is well known:-

“The footwear that has worn out after long walks may become a *kūrca* to wipe the divine body of the Lord *Śiva*. The water gorgled in the mouth does the work of the divine holy bath to *Puraripu*. The left over of the mouthful of meat eaten a little bit, becomes a freshly prepared *navyanaivedya* fit to be used in worship. What is it that *Bhakti* cannot do? Even the hunter who dwells in the forest may be considered as an outstanding devotee\! What a wonder\!

> मार्गावर्तितपादुका पशुपतेरङ्गस्य कूर्चायते ।   
> गण्डूषाम्बुनिषेचनं पुररिपोर्दिव्याभिषेकायते ॥   
> किञ्चिद् भक्षितमांसशेषकबलं नव्योपहारायते ।   
> भक्तिः किं न करोत्यहो\! वनचरो भक्तावतंसायते॥ \(*Śloka* 63\) 

According to *Śiva Purāṇa* the hunter’s name is *Gurudruha*. This most wicked and cruel hunter had to fast inevitably for the whole day on a *Śivarātri*, as he did not get any game. On that night, waiting for a game he was seated on a *bilva* tree, had kept by his side a dried gourd container filled with water. When he was just about to shoot an arrow at a doe that accidentally came there, the water from the gourd cup, and the *bilva* leaves happened to fall on a *Śivaliṅga* which was at the foot of the tree and \(this sequence\) turned out to be the *Śivapūja* of the first *yāma* without the knowledge of the hunter. And thus his sins were redeemed. He became compassionate and confident towards the doe and sent it to it’s group to obtain their permission and return. Somehow the worship of *Śiva* was done during the remaining *yāma*s also of the night, unawares. At that period of time, it happened that this doe’s sister and other deer came there to drink water, and he let them also to return after obtaining the permission of their group. And finally, by the virtue of the worship done by him in the last *yāma*, all his sins got burnt into ashes and *jnāna* dawned on him. Then he released all the deer that had come back as promised, and so *Bhagavān Mahādeva* appeared before him in personified form and named him *‘Guha’*. He also blessed him that when *Śrīmannārāyaṇa* in his divine incarnation as *Śrīrāma* comes to the forest he \(i.e. *guha*\) will have the *yoga* of friendship of *Rāma,* and by serving him, he will obtain *Mukti* which is hard to obtain. “Even those deer also will attain salvation.” \(says Lord *Śiva*\)

> एतस्मिन्नन्तरे ते तु कृत्वा शङ्करदर्शनम्   
> सर्वे प्रणम्य सन्मुत्तिं मृगयोनेः प्रपेदिरे ॥   
\(शिवपुराण, कोटिरुद्रसंहिता, अध्याय 40\) 

In *GaruḍaPurāṇa* and *AgniPurāṇa,* the name of the hunter is stated as *‘Sundarasenaka’*. The hunter returns to his home and does *‘Pāraṇa’*. At the time of his death, the servants of Lord *Śiva* drive away the servants of *yama* who had come there to take him, and then they take him and also his dear dog to *Kailasa*. \(*Garuḍa purāṇa*: I 111-24; *Agnipurāṇa*: 193-6\)

According to *Skāndapurāṇa* the name of that hunter is *‘Canda’*. Unable to get any food, he and his wife who was also most sinful like him, fast on the night of *Śivarātri*. The next morning, some dog eats up the food she had brought for her husband. When she angrily rushes to kill the dog, her husband stops her. As he had unknowingly observed fasting and *Śivapūja* on the previous night, several *ātmaguṇas* such as compassion manifest in his mind. So he becomes most dear to Lord *Śiva*. On the *Amāvāsya* which was the next day after that *Śivarātri*, in the afternoon, he along with his wife attains the divine world of *Śiva* itself.

स\(कोटिरुद्र संहिता - अध्याय 40\) 

Are these stories true or only imaginations? Even if all of them are true which story is the true one? To what extent? Questions such as these are not important to us. All these stories proclaim a single conclusion that when it has happened that because someone, without any devotion, faith or knowledge and with no specific reason happened to fast on *Śivarātri* and offered bath and bilwa leaves to *Śiva* obtained such a great state, why can’t one attain the supreme *purushārtha* if he worships *Śiva* with devotion, faith and knowledge, after fasting on that day?

*Jnānis* say—“We discussed all the *śāstras*. We critically assessed all the *dharma*s. We discussed and made the critical assessment several times. The conclusion drawn from all that is that the observance of *Śivarātri* is the best of all. None of all these viz many *vratas*, various pilgrimages, awesome *danas,* several kinds of *yajnas,* penances or *japas* can equal this *vrata* of *Śivarātri*. Those who desire happiness should observe this *Śivarātri vrata*, which is most auspicious, and which bestows *Bhukti* and *Mukti*. I have thus narrated the glory of this sacred *Śivarātri vrata*. This is called ‘King of *vrata*s’. What else you want to hear, Please ask”.

*Śivarātri vrata* should necessarily be observed by all. On that day *Śivā* should be worshipped by fasting, restraint of senses, meditation, *pūjā* and singing of his praises. By these, one attains all the four fold values. The purport of these stories is to drive home this *tattva* indeed.

### When and at what time should this be observed

		
We have already noted that *Mahāśivarātri vrata* should be observed on the *caturdaśī* of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* of the month of *māgha*. Now we shall explain the specific day of the *vrata* and the time of worship.

As the very name *Śivarātri* indicates, auspicious and the prescribed time for the observance is the night alone, and there can be no doubt about it. Though as a general rule the *yajnas* and *pūjas* related to *devatas* are prohibited during nights, it is special that the night time is highly auspicious for worship of *Śivarātri*.

*Śāstras* state that *Paraśiva* himself has proclaimed as follows:- “During *‘kaliyuga’,* I travel on the earth only during the night of that *caturdaśī*, and I enter into all that is animate and inanimate things. I shall redeem the sins committed by *jīvas* during the whole year. This *Mahima* will not be there during the day time”.

> माघमासस्य कृष्णायां चतुर्दश्यां सुरेश्वर ।   
> अहं वत्स्यामि भूपृष्ठे रात्रौ नैव दिवा कलौ ॥ 

> लिङ्गेषु च समस्तेषु चलेषु स्थावरेषु च ।   
> सङ्क्रमिष्याम्यसन्दिग्धं वर्षपापविशुद्धये ॥ \(नागरखण्ड\) 

The following statement from *skandapurāṇa* also justifies that the night only is precious for the observation of the *vrata*.

As Lord *Śiva* with the trident held in his hand, and also his \(forces\) and the *Bhūtagaṇas* travel in the night of that *caturdaśī*, their worship should be done then only.

> निशि भ्रमन्ति भूतानि शक्तयः शूलभृद्यतः ।   
> अतस्तस्यां चतुर्दश्यां निशि तत्पूजनं भवेत् ॥ 

**We remember here with reverence the explanation bestowed upon us by *Śrīraṅgagurudeva* in this regard. He said:- “The *bhūtas* that have been stated here as attendants of *Śiva* are not beings that cause fear or disgust. They, are his retinue, and are devotees and *Jnānis*.** They have the power to grant *jnāna* and other desires and prosperity to those who worship them. They help *Rudradeva* in the work of destruction also”.

One should not raise an objection here saying—“Will not there be the *sānnidhya* of the Lord during day time on that day? Why should HE the ever omnipresent should be worshipped specially only during the night”? It is true that *Jnānis* visualize God at all times, as evident from the words “सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः”. Even then, the principle that should be noted here is, as per the *Saṅkalpa* of the almighty, in the body of the *Kālarūpa* of that God *Mahākāla*, the environs and the circumstances both inner and outer present on that day, will be highly congenial for both meditational worship of God and the accomplishment of the desires and prosperity of the devotees, during that night only.

**Again we remember here the inspiring words by *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* which carry the following purport:- “The day is *Śivarātri*. It is a great** night. It is a dark night for sins. But a night of happiness for *Siddhas* and *Sādhakas*. It is a strange night, which is dark for the spiritually poor, but daytime itself for the great souls with inner vision. Outside, it is a night with a clear sky bereft of clouds. Inside also, it is a clear sky of pure divine knowledge without the veil of the clouds of ignorance. Outside, the moon \(is seen\) with only one *kalā*, and inside it is the *kalā* of pure *Caitanya*. The *Jnānis* having experienced the auspicious festival of *Jnānananda* inside, and calling it *‘Śivarātri’* for the external world, and merging the *Kālātīta* into the time, made him the object of worship. This is that *‘Mahāśivarātri’*, which the *Jnānis* have brought forth to us.”

What should be the extent of the *caturdaśi tithi* on that day? Some *śāstravākyas* say that it should prevail in the midnight. Some other *śāstravākyas* opine that it should prevail in the *pradosha samaya*.

> निशीथा संयुता या तु कृष्णपक्षे चतुर्दशी ।   
> उपोष्या सा तिथिः श्रेष्ठा शिवसायुज्यकारिणी ॥ स्कान्द I-1-33 

> प्रदोषव्यापिनी ग्राह्या शिवरात्रिचतुर्दशी।   
> रात्रौ जागरणं यस्मात् तस्मात्तां समुपोषयेत् ॥ \(हेमाद्रि\) 

The treatise *śāana samhita* says that *caturdaśi* should prevail even before midnight and also after midnight, and *Śivarātri* should be observed at that time only.

The conclusion in this regard is drawn as follows: There is no doubt that *Śivarātri* should be observed if *caturdaśi* prevails both in *Pradosha* and during night. If *caturdaśi* prevails on the nights of both the days, or, if it does not prevail on the nights of both the days then *Śivarātri* is \(to be observed\) on the day of *Pradoshavyāpti*. If there is *Pradoshavyāpti* on both the days, or, if there is no *Pradoshavyāpti* on both the days then *Śivarātri* is to be observed on the day when it prevails in the night \(midnight\). If it prevails during the night on one day and during *pradosha* on the other day, then *Śivarātri* should be observed on the day, when there is *Jayāyoga* \(*Trayodaśīyoga*\)

**In this regard, *Śrīrangagurudeva* had stated as follows:- *“Trayodaśīi* is a form of Śakti. *caturdaśi* is a form of *Śiva*. Therefore if *caturdaśi tithi* is conjoined with *trayodaśī*, then the *yoga* of *Śiva* and *Śakti* occurs.** If such a good time becomes available, it is precious for the observance of *Śivarātri”*.

We had noted earlier that it is auspicious for the observance of *ŚrīKṛshṇajayantī* if it happens to fall on a Wednesday or Monday. The *śāstras* say that it is best for the observance of *Śivarātri*, if it happens to fall on a Sunday or a Tuesday.

> माघकृष्णचतुर्दश्यां रविवारो भवेद्यदि।   
> भौमो वापि भवेद्देवि कर्तव्यं व्रतमुत्तमम् ॥ \(स्कान्द\) 

### How should it be observed?

*Śivarātri vrata* should be observed in such a manner that it pleases Lord *Śiva*. The bliss of meditation and the wealth of *ātmaguṇas* are very dear to him. The eight famous *ātmaguṇas* are—kindness to all the living beings, absence of envy, purity, obsence of exertion \(difficulty\), absence of greed, absence of stinginess, forgiveness and auspiciousness. One should possess both the external and the internal purities which are in accordance with the experience of *ātmānanda* and the expression of *ātmaguṇas*. The vows such as non-violence, truthfulness, absence of anger, *Brahmacarya* etc., which are common in all observances should be strictly followed in this *vrata* also. *Mānasapūja* of God is the best. It is also good to perform the external worship that fosters the mental worship, or as a form of expression of mental worship. The inner worship is in the form *dhyānasamādhi*. The external worship will be in the form of *Āvāhana, Āsana, Arghya, pādya, Ācamanīya, Abhisheka, Vastra, Upavīta, Gandha, Pushpa, Dhūpa, Dīpa, Arcana, Naivedya, Pradakshiṇanamaskāra, stotra* and *Sangīta* \(inclusive of dance, songs and instrumental music etc.\) Among these services, *Abhisheka* is most dear to *Śiva.* The *śāstras* say:

“अलङ्कारप्रियो विष्णुः, अभिषेकप्रियः शिवः”. If this *abhisheka* is done through the horn of a cow, *Śiva* feels highly pleased. Among the flowers and leaves, *bilva* leaves, lotus flowers, and *tumbe* flowers make Lord *Śiva* distinctly pleased. ***Śrīgurudeva* had told us that the red hibiscus is most dear to Lord *Śiva***.

*Śāstras* mention two special means to make oneself *Śivamaya* during *Śivarātri*.—1. Fasting and 2. Keeping awake in the night. In this, *Śivarātri* may be compared to *Ekādaśī*. Both are festivals of fasting.

Which is more important in the observance of *Śivarātri*? Fasting or keeping awake? In the *purāṇas* and the works of *tantra śāstra*, we come across a discussion on this topic. The treatise *‘Tithitattva’* says that fasting itself is more important.

> अस्यामुपवासः प्रधानं न स्नानेन न वस्त्रेण न धूपेन न चार्चया ।   
> तुष्यामि न तथा पुष्पैः यथा तत्रोपवासतः   
> यो मां जागरयते रात्रिं मनुजः स्वर्गमारुहेत् 

These statements tell us the greatness of *Jāgaraṇa*. *Pūja* is indeed important. Some others give equal importance to all the three i.e.- fasting, vigil and worship.

> वस्तुतस्तु त्रयाणामेव प्राधान्यमित्ययमेव पक्षः ।   
> वैश्वानरविद्योपासनन्यायेन समुदाय एव अत्र अनुष्ठेयः । 

There is no doubt that observing all the three i.e. *pūja*, fasting and *Jāgaraṇa* in keeping with one’s ability is excellent. But it is necessary for us to understand which one among these three is most important. When one is not able to observe all the three, which two should be necessarily observed? If even those two cannot be observed, which one of the two should be observed? Of the three which is primary? Which are secondary? These should be understood with composure.

God should be worshipped for the attainment of the four fold values of life viz. *dharma*, *artha*, *kāma* and *moksha*. He should be worshipped both internally and externally. To facilitate such meditation and external worships, total fasting is prescribed. “If *dhyāna* and worship become affected as a result of such fasting, which of them should be given up? Is it *dhyāna* or fasting? The answer is, fasting should be considered unimportant. Those who are unable to fast for the whole day, may fast at least for a part of the day. Let them not consume such foods which produce *rajas* and *tamas*. Let them take such food permitted by the *śāstras* in a small quantity to keep the body light. Let them not consume foodstuffs which cause heaviness in the body and agitation to the senses, as evident from the saying *“Annakke Mūru Mānavādare Appaccige Āru māna”*

Now let us discuss the issue of *Jāgaraṇa*. The entire night of *Śivarātri* should be utilized for meditation and worship of God. *Śāstras* say that one should keep vigil during the night so that he may not waste such an invaluable time of the night in indulging in sleep, which is the work of *tamoguṇa*. We can see that ordinary people forgetting this \(*tattva*\), merely think that it is meritorious to keep awake and indulge in undesirable activities through that night, such as stealing, quarrelling and viewing pictures \(or films\) which agitate the senses etc., In a certain village, some youth roaming about during the night of *Mahāśivarātri* went on pelting stones at houses. The householders were busy in protecting themselves and their houses from this rain of stones. Somebody asked—“Cannot this bad habit of these youth be stopped? Is it proper they indulge in such a sinful act on such a meritorious day?” Some foolish leaders said in reply “Whatever be it, did this not facilitate *Jāgaraṇa* by both i.e. the band of youth and the householders for the whole night? Both of them have obtained the *puṇya* by observing *Jāgaraṇa* of *Śivarātri* because of that only.” This is shameful and ridiculous foolishness\!

*Jāgaraṇa* on *Śivarātri* means only to keep oneself awake in meditation and worship of God. Keeping awake for worldly matters which are opposed to meditation and worship, and that too keeping awake and indulging in undesirable things, is a *Jāgaraṇa* which is demonical in nature. It can never be a dear to Lord *Śiva*. The stories which render the glory of *Śivarātri* are only *arthavādas* which praise *Jāgaraṇa* and fasting for the purpose of worship; they are not *śāstras* which just preach the ideals of observances of devotees.

“What should be the observance of devotees of God at all times \(especially on the days of festivals\)? What should they not observe? What is the rule? What is forbidden? When such doubts airse, who \(or what\) should be the ordainer \(or the ordaining factor\)?” The answer is, one should always remember God and never forget HIM. All the dos and don’ts are dependent on these two only.

सर्वे विधिनिषेधाश्च एताभ्यामेव यन्त्रितौ॥

This ambrosial teaching of *Śrīmad Anandatīrtha* may be remembered here.

Now, based on the course of these arguments, what the *śāstras* and traditions tell us about the worship of God, is the next topic.

### How should the *parva* be observed?

To the question how should the great *Śivarātri parva* be observed, the direct and the essential answer is “It should be observed in a manner that pleases *Śiva”. Śiva* is the Lord who is an embodiment of *jnāna* - *ānanda* and *amṛta*. As said in “यश्शिवो नामरूपाभ्याम्”’, HE is the one who has the most auspicious names, forms, attributes and deeds. If one immerses himself in such a God and fills up himself with that God in his mind, speech and acts, it will be a thing which pleases HIM.

“As the adage goes *“Sadāśivanige ade dhyāna”*, meditation pleases HIM exceptionally. In the internal worship, meditation upon God is dearest to him. To facilitate that, *Japa*, singing of praises, worship, *dāna* and *Homa* etc. should be performed on that day. To the extent possible, fasting should be observed to facilitate mental purity, and vigil at night should be observed for the sake of special worship. As the words “अभिषेकप्रियः शिवः” states, *abhisheka* is very dear to Lord *Śiva*. During the *Jāgaraṇa* at night, as a part of the worship, one should listen to the sacred stories such as *Tripurāsura samhāra* which proclaim the great glory of *Śiva*, and by singing HIS praises and by listening to \(the rendering of\) music, one should get immersed in that *Parameśvara* who loves the devotees and who is *āśutosha* \(one who is pleased instantaneously\). The custom of fasting, *Jāgaraṇa* and listening to the stories of Lord *Śiva* is there in all parts of the country. Some special regulations related to the worship etc may be abridged as follows:-

After observing fast on the previous night of *Śivarātri*, one should make a *saṅkalpa* that he is going to observe *Śivarātri* the next day, and should pray to the Lord for an obstacle free completion of the *vrata*. *Abhisheka* should be performed to *Śivaliṅga* using *pañcagavya* and *pañcāmṛta*, and chanting of vedic hyms related to *Rudra* such as *śatarudrīya* \(*namaka, camaka*\) and *Śivapañcākshari mahāmantra.* After offering *Shoḍaśopacāras* such as *Āvāhana, Arghya* etc., Lord *Śiva* should be invoked in the holy fire and the *naivedya* of mustard and *caru* should be offered. At the end of *Agnipūja, pūrṇāhuti* should be offered and then the stories of Lord *Śiva* should be relished by listening to his glories, songs of praise and music etc. God should be worshipped this way, through all the four *yāma*s of the night. *Dānas* should be done, keeping with one’s ability. Gratitude should be offered to Lord *Śiva* for blessing with success in completing the *pūja* without any hurdles, and with humility and devotion, pardon should be begged for offences that might have been committed in the name of service, and for the redemption from all other sins. God should be prayed to grant suitably the fourfold values of life. It is best to observe this precept on all the twelve *Śivarātri*s of the year. It should be observed at least on the day of *Mahāśivarātri*.

Some *śāstras* say that *abhisheka* should be performed to *Śivaliṅga* with milk during the first *yāma*, with curds during the second *yāma,* with ghee during the third *yama*, and with honey during the last *yama*, and, *mantras* with the sacred names of gods viz - *Īśāna, Tatpurusha, Aghora, Vāmadeva* and *Sadyojāta* should be offered. In some *pūjākalpas*, we come across the following description:—“Devotees should wear the *rudrāksha* and *tripunḍra* with sacred ash and go should to the temple of *Śiva* in the evening and should offer prayers to God. With *aṅganyāsa* and *karanyāsa*, *Japa* of *SadāŚiva mantras* should be done and the holy *kalaśa* should be worshipped, *Praṇa Pratishṭhā* should be performed in the *Śivaliṅga* and *Shoḍaśopacāras* should be offered. If it is a *Sthiraliṅga*, or if it has been sanctified by *Jnānis*, there is no need for *praṇapratishṭha*. The Lord should be offered *abhisheka* with the chanting of individual *mantras* viz., *‘Āpyāyasva’* and *‘Āpohishṭhā’*, and with the full hymns of *‘Mahārudra’*, and *‘Purusha sūkta’*; and with *pañcamṛta*, sandal paste, vermillion, camphor, holy water and holy water mixed with turmeric. Instead of performing the holy bath with a conch, the horn of a cow should be used. *Tarpaṇa* should be offered to the eight forms of *Śiva*- viz., *‘Bhava’, ‘Śarva’, ‘Īśāna’, ‘Paśupati’, ‘Ugra’, Rudra, ‘Bhīma’,* and *‘Mahādeva’* and also to his respective divine consorts. God should be offered *bilva* leaves together with the chanting of *ashṭottarasahasranāmas* or *mūlamantra* \(*Pañcakshara*\) and then other services should be offered.”

The flowers and leaves that are specially prescribed for the worship of *Śiva* are *Ekka, oleander*, *bilva, pagaḍe*, *dhatthūrī* and *bṛhatī*.

> चतुर्णां पुष्पजातीनां गन्धमाध्राति शङ्करः ।   
> अर्कस्य करवीरस्य बिल्वस्य वकुलस्य च ॥   
> धत्तूरैर्बृहतीपुष्पैश्च पूजने गोलक्षफलम् । 

Even among these, the most sacred is the *bilva* leaf. We respectuflly remember here with gratitude the enlightenment bestowed upon us *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* with a demonstration, as to how the petals of bilva leaf are composed of the forms of *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Rudra*, and what is the specialty of the aspect of *Rudra* among them, and how the sight, touch and offering of that leaf help us to get elevated to the place of *Śiva*. He had also commanded that *japākusuma* was also auspicious for the worship of *Śiva*.

*Śāstras* say that the observance of this *‘Mahāśivarātri* for twelve or twenty four years, and performing the \(*Udyāpana*\) will bring in the best of best benefits.

Though there are differences in the *pūjakalpas*, all of them prescribe meditation upon Lord *Mahādeva*, doing *Rudrābhisheka* either once or eleven times, worshipping of the Lord, *Jāgaraṇa* and fasting on that day.

The treatise *Dharmasindhu* expounds— *“Mahādeva* is shining like a silver mountain. His head is splendid with the lovely partial moon. He is adorned with jewels of gems. He is holding an axe, and a deer, and is sporting the *Varadābhayamudrā*. He is seated in *padmāsana*. He is wearing the skin of a tiger. He is the great Lord with five faces and three eyes. He is the original form of the universe and is surrounded by groups of *devas* who praise him. He is praised by the whole world. He removes the fear of all, and He is the one with a serene form. One should always meditate upon him, especially on the night of *Mahāśivarātri*.”

> ध्यायेन्नित्यं महेशं रजतगिरिनिभं चारुचन्द्रावतंसम्   
> रत्नाकल्पोज्ज्वलाङ्गं परशुमृगवराभीतिहस्तं प्रसन्नम् । 

> पद्मासीनं समन्तात् स्तुतममरगणैर्व्याध्रकृत्तिं वसानम्   
> विश्वाद्यं विश्ववन्द्यं निखिलभयहरं पञ्चवक्त्रं त्रिनेत्रम् ॥ 

“When should the *Pāraṇa* be done by those who observe the *Śivarātri vrata*? *Pāraṇa* is only after the *caturdaśi tithi* ends”.- “तिथ्यन्ते पारणं भवेत्” say a few texts. According to *skandapurāṇa*, if *caturdaśī tithi* extends even beyond three *yāma*s, then *Pāraṇa* may be done during *caturdaśi tithi* itself. It is best to continue fasting till *caturdahsi tithi* ends and then *Pāraṇa* should be done”. If it happens to be *Amāvāsya* the next day, and the obligation of *tarpaṇa* remaining, those who are supposed to do *tarpaṇa*, should do it and only after that *Pāraṇa* should be done.

Now we shall discuss in brief, some important aspects regarding *Śiva* who is the worshipful deity of the great *parva* of *Mahāśivarātri*.

Why should we discuss *Śiva* here? All these i.e. his form, natural state, attributes, glory and sacred names are well known, isn’t it? Are not the *Vedas, smṛtis, purāṇas*, history, *āgamas, kāvyas,* and literature full of abundant praise for HIM?

Some may even think “He is *Mahādeva*, *Maheśvara*, and Lord of all the *Kshetra* and *Kshetrajnas*. He is the Lord who is the respository of knowledge, power, wealth, valour, strength and effulgence. He has both frightful and benign forms and attributes. He is *Rudradeva* the destroyer; At the same time, He is a merciful God who protects his devotees and grants them their desires soon, and the one who is instantaneously pleased, very pleasant, has a benign form, and especially a great teacher of the universe who bestows knowledge. Being the most auspicious in form, acts and mind etc., he is also the true form of auspiciousness even to *Gaurīdevī* who is *sarvamaṅagalā.* He shines with the appropriate name *‘Śiva’*.

“तमीश्वराणां परमं महेश्वरं तं देवतानां परमं च दैवतम्” “नमश्शिवाय च” “शिवतराय च” “नमश्शङ्कराय च मयस्कराय च” “या ते रुद्र शिवा” “तनूरघोराऽपापकाशिनी” “आद्यं पुरुषमीशानं पुरुहूतं पुरुष्टुतम्” “कल्याणगुणधाम्नेऽस्तु शिवाय विहिता नतिः” “ज्ञानं महेश्वरादिच्छेत्” “प्रधानपुरुषेशाय सर्गस्थित्यन्तहेतवे” “स हि देवः परञ्ज्योतिः तमसः परमुच्यते” 

Divine statements such as these and the divine experiences of great *yogis* openly proclaim this opinion. The tradition of worshipping Lord *Śiva* on *Śivarātri* with devotion, faith and trust is also there in our country. “Why then the necessity of any discussion about him?”-Some may ask.

But we feel that there is such a need distinctly in these days. It is because, writings which shake the very foundation of devotion and faith basic for the worship of *Śiva*, are breeding both here and abroad. Therefore we feel is it necessary to discuss the matter here at least briefly, to bring to light the true meaning of these.

There are two categories of people who are engaged in balderdash. The first ones are the traditionalists with a narrow mind, and the others are those who proclaim themselves as ‘Rationalists’ and declare that it is possible to explain spiritual truths by just expounding some points taken from linguistics and history. The first \(category\) of people raise three important objections regarding the worship of *Śiva*.

1\) “Though *Śiva* is a deity, he is cruel, a destroyer of all, and a savage; He not only hands death to the living beings time to time, but also without kindness or pity kills all the living beings \(except the liberated souls\), at the time of deluge. As a mark of this cruelty, he also performs the ferocious *Tānḍava* Dance. *“Prapancasamhārakatānḍavāya”*. How can a God with such terrible acts and thought be worthy of worship by pious people who are kind and compassionate to living beings? Why should the virtuous people adore this *Rudra* who has given up kindness itself, which is the supreme among *dharma*s? Instead of him, why not worship godly great people who are *Dharmavīras* and *Mahavīras*, and who have sacrificed their body for the good of the world?” This is one objection.

2\) “He lives in the cremation ground. He wears a garland of skulls. His body is smeared with the ashes of the cremation ground. He is either nude or wearing the fresh skin of a tiger or an elephant. He wears inauspicious dress and has inauspicious practices. He roams about with groups of *Bhūtas* who are similar to him in form, conduct and behaviour which are ferocious. His names such as *‘Bhīma’*, *‘Rudra’*, *‘Ugra’* etc are also ferocious. How can he be worshipful to the pious devotees with pure customs and conduct?” This is the second objection.

3\) *“Rudra* is not qualified to receive important *havirbhāga* in *Vaidika yajnas*.

There is a rule that water should be touched for purification immediately after any *Havis* or *Bali* is offered to him. Therefore his worship causes blemish to *vaidik* purity”.—This is the third objection.

Among these the first objection is related to *Rudra’*s job of destruction. Is not killing a cruelty? This may be answered by stating that the act of killing at distinct times can become an act of mercy only. For example, sometimes creatures writhing with pain due to major accidents are killed with a single blow to put an end to their suffering. This is called mercy killing. But God *Rudra* kills even those living beings who are happy. Such an act cannot be called mercy killing.

Killing the wicked that are a bane to the world is also an act of mercy. By such a deed the world is helped and the killed *jīva* suffers here itself, and thus escapes the punishment in the next world. The *jīva* gets purified because of the due atonement for its sin commited. But *Rudra* kills even innocents at the time of deluge and kills even the *devatās* who work for the welfare of the world. How can this be mercy killing or a killing that causes the welfare of the world?

Then why does God *Rudra* carry out these acts of unrighteousness and injustice?” This is the question.

The *Jnānis* provide the right answer to this with the example of sleep in everyday life. Some may say - “Why should God give us sleep every day? Had he not given this sleep at all, some people could have enjoyed more happiness and pleasure. Not only this, they could have done much more for the welfare of the society. So, God is really unjust as he has denied them such good opportunities by giving them sleep”—Those who accuse God like this must be a fools only. Such fools will realize what a punishment it is, if they are unable to sleep even for just a day. During sleep all the organs of the body are withdrawn from activities. But people know by experience, how much of rest, peace and relief are obtained by sleep. Living beings which are tired and weary after work for the whole day, obtain rest from sleep, and after rest, gain fresh energy and inspiration to get into their work. And God, who has created this thing called sleep which provides happiness and enthusiam, should be called merciful indeed by the wise, isn’t it? And it is *Rudra* who causes that sleep. He is the God of *Sushuptisthāna.*

In the same way the *jīvas* which have become tired after doing *karmas* for \(several *yugas*\) need a very long rest and deep and lengthy sleep and God *Rudra* provides such a long \(enduring\) rest for all the *jīvas* by destroying them by the slaying of their bodies at the time of deluge. As rest is needed for all the *jīvas*, the *Puṇyajīvis*, the *pāpajīvis* and the *Miśra jīvis* in the spate of *Karma*, He destroys them. After this long spell of rest, he pushes them into life, as is evident from the saying “धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत्” By that time, they will have gained the required strength to complete their remaining *Karmas* and to attain the four fold values of life. It is Lord *Rudra* who bestows sleep everyday to provide rest. It is Lord *Rudra* who secures death to the *jeevas* whose bodies have become \(worn out\) and rendered impossible to perform their *Karma*s and makes them \(the *jīvas*\) to get new bodies. It is again Lord *Rudra* who, at the time *Mahāpralaya* carries out total destruction and provides sleep-rest \(to the *jīvas*\) till the time of *Mahākāla*. Salutations again and again to such a supremely merciful *Rudradeva*. Lord *Rudra* is as merciful as Lord *Brahma* the creator and as merciful as Lord *Vishṇu* the sustainer, Even though the three *mūrtīs* share and perform these three functions, actually it is only one *paramātma* who carries out all the three. These three are indeed his own incarnations. The *Brahmasūtra* “ओं जन्माद्यस्य यतः” proclaims this purport only. *Vishṇu purāṇa* also expresses the same purport.

> सृष्टिस्थित्यन्तकरिणीं ब्रह्मविष्णुविशात्मिकाम् ।   
> स संज्ञां याति भगवान् एक एव जनार्दनः ॥ 

2\) It is nothing but calumny to call *Rudra* ‘inauspicious’ just because he wears a \(garland\) of human skulls, puts on a raw hide and smears his body with the ashes from the cremation grounds, as all of them are inauspicious things. Generally *mangaladravyas* are used for the purpose of warding off misfortune or attainment of desired wealth. *Śiva*, by his mere will can routout misfortunes. He is the refuge for the \(whole\) world itself. And the one whose all wishes \(desired\) have been gained \(satisfied\) leaving no desire to be fulfilled. What is the need of auspicious things to Him? Our national poet *Kālidāsa* gives a fitting reply to this \(objection\) \(in his *composition*.\)—

> विपत्प्रतीकारपरेण मङ्गलं निषेव्यते भूतिसमुत्सकेन वा ।   
> जगच्छरण्यस्य निराशिषस्सतः किमेभिराशोपहतात्मवृत्तिभिः ॥ \(कुमारसम्भव-सर्ग 5\) 

By his mere touch even the ashes of cremation pyre become sacred and becomes a form of *prasāda* for the great sages. To HIM who is omnipresent, both a garland of skulls and a necklace of gems are one and the same, and both a house of wedding and a cremation ground are just the same, as is evident from the words “तस्मात् सर्वगतश्शिवः” He is the omniscient who is untouched by anything. And he is a *śuddhacaitanyasvarūpa.*

So also, his appearance either as naked person, or as a frantic \(mad\) person adorned by serpents is only because of the absence of worldly desires and interests. and not at all because of either poverty or lack of handsomeness. A story may be recalled here. He who was *Bhīmeśvara* in the work of destruction, is also described as *‘Sundareśvara’* at the time of his wedding, surpassing even *Manmatha* in handsomeness.

***Śrīraṅgamahāguru* had enlightened us as follows: “His companions, the *bhūtagaṇas* are also the glories of Lord *Rudra* who help him in his work of dissolution.** They are pure *Jnānis,* holy souls and like Lord *Śiva* himself, can assume any form at will. They are endowed with the power to grant boons or punish. They must be worshipped at the time of the worshipping of Lord *Śiva* who is \(*jnānamaya*\). Even during auspicious religious functions, the devotees of *Śiva* should remember them for warding off misfortunes. Lord *Śiva* who shines in the association of such great souls, also happens to be the Lord of great souls.”

3\) Why is that Lord *Śiva* is not offered more *havirbhāgas* in the sacrifices of the *VaidikaKarmakānḍa*.?

It is because he belongs to the *jnānakānḍa* which is above *karmakānḍa.* In the *jnānakānḍa*, it is clear that he receives a special worship which is evident from the saying “ज्ञानमिच्छेन्महेश्वरात्” And in the *Rudra* and *Atirudra* \(sacrifices\) etc., he is the main deity. In the other *Karmakānḍa yajnas* also, he is given a stipulated part of the *havis*. *Dakshaprajāpati* was subjected to punishment because he committed the offence of averting it.

***Śrīraṅgagurudeva* had told us a *yogarahasya* regarding one aspect here—*“Śāstras* say that after offering the oblation to *Śiva* one should touch water.** But this is not for removing any impurity. If it were to be so, the atonement *vidhi* would be like “Hands should be washed well, Bath should be had” etc. Here it has been ordained that water should just be touched. The purpose is not purification. While offering *havis* to *Śiva* the Lord of dissolution, the person offering the oblation should be in the state of *dhyānasamādhi* specially. The touch of water helps him to return from that state to the state of wakefulness, for performing *Karmas*. So, water is to be touched for that purpose only and not for the purpose of purification. Though meditation is necessary for offering *havis* to any *devatā*, the mind gets dissolved in the Lord of dissolution \(*Śiva*\), who is always immersed in *dhyānasamādhi* as the saying goes *‘Śadāśivanige ade dhyāna’* To return from that state to the state of wakefulness, one has to touch water”.

No doubt it is a great *kalpa* to worship *Nārāyaṇa* as *Paradevatā.* But making offensive accusations against *Rudra* is not a part of that worship. Similarly, speaking contemptuously of *Nārāyaṇa* by the *Upāsakas* of *Śiva* who single mindedly worship him, does not become a part of *Śiva’*s worship. Here we would like to remind that it is auspicious for both to worship their chosen deity with single minded devotion, by remaining truthful, peaceful and by exercising restraint.

We wish to present clarification to some wrong notions regarding Lord *Śiva*, in the format of questions and answers.

Question 1: *Śiva* is a God of *tamoguṇa*. It is for this reason the *purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* state that it is mostly the *Asuras* and *Rākshasas* who worship him. For example, *Bhasmāsura, Vṛkāsura, Bāṇāsura, Rāvaṇa* and others are well known as great devotees of *Śiva*. Therefore is it not improper for *sattvikas* to worship the *tamomaya Rudra*-*Śiva* who is *Raudrarasapradhāna*?

Answer: The above conclusion does not conform to *śāstras*. Lord *Śiva* in the form of *Rudra* is the presiding deity of *tamoguṇa*. As per the will of God, he was appointed as the presiding deity of *tamoguṇa*. Lord *Rudra* is a diety who controls it, and is not a deity under its control. He has the radiance of both *tāmasa* and *sāttvika guṇas.* The *asuras* with *tāmasa* propensities worship the *tāmasa* radiance in him, and obtain terrible occult powers accordingly. Likewise the \(*sattvik*\) pious and gentle devotees -i.e. the *devatās*, sages and human beings, worship the *sāttvika* radiance and obtain *Siddhis* like divine knowledge etc. The examples for this are *Kubera* the king of *yakshas*, great sage *Mārkanḍeya,* sage *Vyaghrapāda* and the hunter *Bedara Kaṇṇappa* and others. There is neither any proof in the *śāstras* to state that all the devotees of *Śiva* are *tāmasa,* nor there are any clearly decided examples.

In HIS divine bodies, both the forms ie. *Ghora* and *Aghora* are there. The *Asuras* and *Rākshasas* etc. worship the *ghora* form and obtaining *siddhis* accordingly, cause torment to the world. Then God himself subjugates them assuming a different form. For example, we learn from the *purāṇas* that *MahāVishṇu* killed demons like *Bhasmāsura, Vṛkāsura* and *Rāvaṇa* and *Vishṇu* broke the \(arrogance\) of *Baṇasura etc.*

Question 2: Is there any poof in the *śāstras* to state that Lord *Śiva* has a benign peaceful form also?

Answer: There is a very clear proof. The very name *Śiva* says that he is the embodiment of auspicious forms, *guṇas* and power. Even in his form of *Rudra* there are two modes viz *Ghora* and *Aghora*. The *śatarudrīya śruti* clearly states that devotees obtain auspiciousness from the form *Aghora,* which is not *pāpaprakaśaka*.

“या ते रुद्र शिवा तनूरघोराऽपापकाशिनी ।   
तयानस्तनुवा शन्तमया ।” 

When there is a benign, peaceful mode even in his *Rudra* form itself, there is no need to state separately that the *Śiva* form of his is tranquil and exceptionally auspicious.

Question 3: Modern commentators say *“RudraŚiva* is really a ferocious form. To be violent is his nature. As he makes people cry by his violence he is called *Rudra*. He is named *Śiva* for pretention to escape his cruelty as he is \(by nature\) violent. For example the *samvatsara* by name *Kshaya* is called *akshya samvatsara* preferring atleast a good name for it. The inauspicious day \(i.e Tuesay\) is called *Maṅgalavāra* \! Likewise, the custom of calling the inauspicious *Rudra* by the peaceful name *Śiva* has come into vogue from ancient times. In linguistics this is called euphemism \(i.e., a gentle word, a gracious word, a mild word\). Basically *Rudra* was a God of terror and wickedness”. Is this opinion of the modern critics correct?

Answer: It is certainly not correct. If *RudraŚiva* were to be a deity full of *tāmas* which inspires wickedness, he would not have been described vividly as Lord *SadaŚiva* immersed in deep meditation. It would not have been stated that one should desire divine knowledge from him. “ज्ञानमिच्छेन्महेश्वरात्”. Had it been so, *śāstras* would have rather stated—“Learn *tāmas* from him,” instead of “Learn *tapas* from him”. This is not the view of the *śāstras*.

Question 4: According to the *Māhābhārata, Brahma* and *Rudra* were respectively born from the tranquility and anger of *Parabrahman* “तावुभौ विबुधश्रेष्ठौ प्रसाद-क्रोधसम्भवौ” How can *Rudra* born of anger grant *Dhātuprasannatā* and divine knowledge?

Answer: The purport of that sentence is, he kills the wicked by invoking anger; At the time of the great deluge he destroys all beings for the welfare of all the *jivas*. and that *Rudra* is the form of God who blesses the *jīvas* in the form of a punisher, and not that he is a *prakṛtapurusha* who is overcome by the force of anger. One should understand that anger is an attribute which he has accepted out of volition.

Question 5: *Śāstras* state that *‘Ekādaśarudras’* are forms of *Rudradeva* and the form of *Śankara* among them is prominent. “रुद्राणामस्मि शङ्करः” Also it is mentioned that they are *devatās* who help *Indra* and are under his control. So, How can this group of *Rudra*s who are under the control of *Indra*, and *Śankara* the prominent among them be called *Bhagavanmūrti*?

Answer: Even though Lord *Rudra* himself has incarnated in that form out of his own will to help *Indra* for the completion of *tattva*s, there is no doubt that he is naturally the all controlling divine form. For example, God *MahāVishṇu* incarnated in the form of *Upendra* i.e. as the younger brother of *Indra* for the protection of *Indra* and for the completion of *tattva*s. But in reality, *Upendra* is the auspicious form of God. So also is God *Rudra*.

Question 6: There are only three full *sūktas* which refer to *Rudra* in the *Ṛgveda*. There is only one *sūkta* for *Soma*. It is found in bits in other places. The name of *Rudra* appears only seventy five times in all. But there are 250 on *Indra*. No other *devatā* has the prominence or glory as that of *Indra*. He alone is the popular national *devatā* of the ancient Aryan. *Rudra* is a very secondary deity. So also is *Vishṇu*. The modern scholars state that both of them obtained paramount importance only in later times. Is it correct?

**Answer: When we placed this question before *Śrīraṅgagurudeva* he had graced a kind reply as follows:- “It is true that the praises of *Indra* outnumber the praises of *Rudra* and *Vishṇu* which appear in the portions of *vaidikasamhitābrāhmaṇa*.** It is proper also. It is because the *samhitābrāhmaṇas* are related to *Karmakāṇḍa*. The importance in *Karmakāṇḍa*s is for *Indra* and others only. But in the *Upanishads* which are *jnānakāṇḍa*, the paramount supremacy of *Vishṇu* and *Rudra* has been clearly proclaimed. *Rudra* is eulogized as ‘The supreme Lord of all the Lords. He is the supreme *devatā* of all the *devatas’*. \(तमीश्वराणां परमं महेश्वरं तं देवतानां परमं च दैवतम्\). The *kaṭhopanishat* declares the place of *Vishṇu* as *‘Parama pāda’*. “सोऽध्वनः पारमाप्नोति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्” There is no need for the mention of *Rudra* in *Karmakānḍa* to a greater extent.”

Even in the parts of *Samhitas*, in the prayers made for *ojas* \(power\), *tejas*, strength and protection from *dasyus*, there are sentences that clearly proclaim the purport that *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* are supreme *devatās* and Gods. For example, the *Aitareya brahmaṇa* states—*‘Agni* is placed very low among *devatas*. But *Vishṇu* is the most supreme *devatā’*.  ‘अग्निर्वै देवानामवमो विष्णुपरमः’. One can note *samhita mantras* here \(which proclaim he supremacy of *Vishṇu*\)—“He is ancient to all *devatās*. He is the doer of everything. Though ever ancient, he is ever new. He is accompanied by his divine consort. One should praise his glory in the state of incarnation also”. “यः पूर्व्याय वेधसे नवीयसे सुमज्जानये विष्णवे ददाशति। यो जातमस्य महतो महिब्रवात्” etc. So also, there are *Vedic hymns* that proclaim the total supremacy of *Rudra* in abundance. As this is a chapter related to *Rudradevatā*, we shall quote some of those *Vedic hymns*. “Rudra is the Lord of this great universe”

ईशानादस्य भुवनस्य भूरेः \(2-33-91\)

		
*“Śrī Rudra* is the father of the entire world.”

भुवनस्य पितरं गीर्भिराभी रुद्रम् \(6-49-10\)

There is no one else who is more effulgent than *Rudra*.”

न वा ओजीयो रुद्र त्वदस्ति \(ऋ 2-33-10\)

*Rudra* is famous. He is hidden in the cave.

स्तुहि श्रुतं गर्तसदं युवानम् \(ऋ2-33-11\)

“He is a God who pervades fire, water, herbs and creepers. He can create this universe and the world. Salutations to such a *Rudra”*

> यो रुद्रो अग्नौ यो अप्सु अन्तर्यओषधीर्वीरुध आविवेश।   
> य इमा विश्वा भुवनानि चक्लृपेे तस्मै रुद्राय नमो अस्तु” ॥   
\(अथर्व सं. 7-92-1\) 

*“Rudra* is only one, he has no equal”

एक एव रुद्रो न द्वितीयाय तस्ये

\(He himself is *aryamā*, *varuṇa*, and he alone is the *Mahādevarudra*\)

“सोऽर्यमा स वरुणः स रुद्रः स महादेवः \(अथर्व 13-41\)

“O *Rudra* \! we have heard that you are the best physician even among physicians.”

भिषक्तमं त्वा भिषजां शृणोमि \(ऋग्वेद सं II 33-11\)

“I take refuge in *Rudra* like the one who takes shelter under a tree in a hot sun”.

घृणीव छायामरपा अशीय \(यजु, II-33-7\)

Moreover, the famous part of *Yajurvedasamhitā* viz *Śatarudrīya* expounds the purport that *Rudra* is the omnipresent God and the whole universe is filled with *Rudra’*, And it has been clearly proclaimed in the *samhitā, brahmaṇa* and *Upanishads* that *Rudra* is God himself. Only in the *Karmakānḍa* it is stated that he is the helping deity of *Indra*. It should be understood that all \(unique\) words such as - “विश्वरूप” “गर्तसद” “पुलिस्ति” “अधिवक्ता” “प्रथमो दैव्यो भिषक्” “देवानां हृदयः” etc that appear in the *Vedas,* expound his divine true form only.

Question 7: *“Rudra* was the *devatā* of *Bhāratīya Ārya* race, *Śiva* was the *devata* of Dravidians. When the cultures of *Āryas* and *Drāviḍas* got merged in course of time, *Śiva*- *Rudra* was conceived as one God and was consequently established in *vaidik* culture” is the opinion of some people. The reason for this is, in the *Ṛgveda mantras*, this *devatā* is called only by the name *‘Rudra’*. The name *Śiva* is not to be found anywhere there. Therefore the Aryans must have received this name from the Dravidians. Dravidians were worshipping *‘Śiva’* since ancient times. Even now the population of Saivities is more in the *Drāvida* country only. Dravidians did not know the name *‘Rudra’*. They took it from Aryans and in the end, combined both these *devatās*, and both Aryans and Dravidians started worshipping it. Basically speaking it is evident that *Rudra* is a *devatā* of Northern \(Aryan\) people and *Śiva* is a *devatā* of Southern \(Dravidian\) people.“—Some opine like this, Is it correct?

Answer: It is true that the western \(Christian\) priests have spread the notion in the east *\(i.e. in Bhārata\)* that *Rudra* is the god of northerners and *Śiva* is the god of the southerners. But this opinion is wrong. This concept of north-south deity is as ridiculous as distingushing \(the sun as\) “Sun of North India and Sun of South India”. Actually, from times immemorial, both the names viz. *Rudra* and *Śiva* are used to refer to the same God in our culture, and this is the definite opinion of the *Vedas*, *Smṛtis*, *Itihāsas* and traditions and also the *Mahā yogis*. There is no proof in any of the *śāstras* to say that both *Śiva* and *Rudra* were originally different. Though the name *Śiva* has not been used for *Rudra* in the *Ṛgveda mantras* that are currently available, he has been clearly called *Śiva* and *Śivatara* in *Yajurveda mantras*. “नमश्शिवाय च शिवतराय च” *\(Śatarudrīya\)*. In the *Ṛgveda mantras* also we see the words such as *śantama, mīḍhushṭama, mṛḷa* and *mayaskara* which give the sense of *Śiva* i.e., \(auspicious\) only.

कद्रुद्राय प्रचेतसे मील्हुष्टमाय तव्यसे वोचेम शन्तमं हृदे \(ऋग्वेद 143/1-2, 4-6\)

“मृळा नो रुद्रोत नो मयस्कृघिः \(ऋग्वेद 1-114/1-11\)

That the word *‘Śiva’* signifies auspiciousness is clear from the following *hymn*:—

‘शिवा नस्सुमना भव’ ‘शिवापतिभ्यः सुमनास्सुवचा’ \(*Ṛgveda*—*Vivāha-mantra*\). Therefore we have no doubt in the fact that the word *Śiva* denotes *Bhagavān Śiva* which is *Maṅgalātmaka* and which is acceptable to the ancient *Vedas*. There is no question of division as *Arya-Drāviḍa,* Language, race etc. here.

Question 8: There may not be evidence in the *Vedas* and *śāstras* to say that *‘Śiva’* is a *devatā* of Dravidians. But according to the modern linguistics the word *‘Śiva’* has come from the group of Dravidian languages only. In the original Dravidian language there is a seed word *‘Śin’. Śin* means red. Words *‘cin’, ‘cen’* and *‘ken’* belong to this category. As *Śiva* was a red coloured *kencanna*, Dravidians gave him the name *‘Śiva’*. Therefore this does not give the sense of an Aryan deity. Is it not true?

Answer: Certainly it is not true. It is because in the *samskṛta* language, the word *Śiva* is derived from the root *‘sī’* which means to sleep, and there is brevity in saying so. Everyone who has experienced the bliss of sleep knows that there is no other state which is more blissful. Experts say that *Rudra* is the presiding deity for deep sleep. There is no harm in understanding that just as the word *‘Śam’* is the origin for the words *śānti* \(peace\), and *Śama* \(*nemmadi*-serenity\), the word *‘sī’* is the source for the word *‘Śiva’*. This is not a round about meaning, but a direct meaning.

Moreover, there is no evidence at all to say that *Śiva* is pure red complexioned.

Question 9: There is not doubt that *Śiva’*s form appeared as a red complexioned one to the eyes of *the Vedic* seers. He is a form of *Agni*. “रुद्रो अग्निः स्विष्टकृत्” The color of *Agni* is red. Also, the *Ṛgveda* describes *Rudra* as *Babhruh, Prababhruh* \(2-33, 2, 8, and 15\), i.e., yellow colored, closer to Red \(brown\), and the one who shines like gold. “हिरण्यमिव रोचते. ” Therefore”, says a modern scholar by name *Śam bā Joshi* “the word *Śiva* denotes one who is red coloured”, isn’t it?

Answer: His explanation is against the *vaidika* description. The *Ṛgveda mantras* have not at all stated that he is of pure red complexion as he puts it. They describe HIM as brown complexioned and white complexioned only. “प्रबभ्रवे वृषभाय श्वितीचे”. The word *Babhru* means both yellow coloured and brown colored. There is no nearness to red colour even while describing *Rudra* as shining like gold “हिरण्यमिव रोचते” Because in the description “शुक्र इव सूर्यः हिरण्यमिव रोचते” \(1-43, 1-2, 4-6\) the comparison of the white complexioned sun is given with gold. The word *‘śvitīce’* makes clear that he is of white complexion only. *Śāstras* state that he is. So the word *‘Śiva’* does not mean *kenchanna”*. *Śiva* is white complexioned, or shining like pure gold.

Question 10: In the *Rudra mantra*, since *Rudra* deva is called as *“Tāmra, Aruṇa, Babhru* and *Sumaṅgala”* \(असौ यस्ताम्रो अरुण उत बभ्रुस्सुमङ्गलः\) can there remain any doubt in the fact that he is red complexioned?

Answer: That *mantra* appears in the *yajurveda*. We are happy to note that you have taken this *mantra* as a proof similar to the one of *Ṛgveda*. But the words *tāmra* and *babhru* appearing there, do not directly apply to the divine auspicious from of *Rudradeva*. This is made clear by the sentence next to it. \(In fact\) it is the description of *Sūryadeva.* He appears as *tāmravarṇa* followed by *aruṇavarṇa* \[these are variants of red color\] and *babhru varṇa* \(brown colored\), by changing colors at distinct times. He is seen even by the cowherds. “The women carrying water also see him.” \(उतैनं गोपा अदृशन्नदृशन्नुदहार्यः\) This sentence applies to the Sun only, isn’t it? It is only the *Sūryadeva* who appears clearly to the \(external\) eyes not only of the *Jnānis* but also of the ordinary people. This *Sūrya* also is a form of *Rudra* visible to even ordinary people when he changes over to red and brown colours. Even *Agni* is the external form of that *Rudra*. Nowhere in the *Vedas* has it been described that all the colours of visible *Śiva* as pure red. It is not the true form of *Rudra;* but the form of *Sūrya* which is the abode of his worship, This is but the natural purport. The opinion of *Sayaṇa* and other commentators is also the same.

Question 11: “Ancient commentators have interpreted the word *Rudra* as the one who makes everyone cry during deluge, the one who gives the speech of spiritual knowledge, the one who rives darkness or the one who cried witnessing the torment of *‘Prajāpati’*, and the one who destroys the grief of the wordly life etc., But it is not right. The correct meaning is ‘the one who is red complexioned. And that word \(*Rudra*\) is closer to the words *rudhira*, red and ruddy. Therefore *Rudra* also is a Dravidian *devatā*. The Aryans translated the pure Kannada word *‘Śiva’ kencanna* into Sanskrit word as *‘Rudra’*.“—This is the argument of some modern scholars. Is this correct?

Answer: It won’t be correct. Because, the word *‘Rudra’* is closer to *rud* \(To cry\) and not to the word *‘Rudhira’* \(blood\). Even from the view point of linguistics, the meanings viz, ‘the one who makes the sinners cry’, ‘the one who makes everyone cry during the time of destruction,’, ‘the one who also cries beholding the grief of the *jīvas* and the one who makes sounds etc. are closer to the word *‘Rudra’*. It also matches the description of *Rudradeva* described in the *śāstras*.

Question 12: “The concept that *Rudra* is a destroyer is of recent origin. According to *Ṛgveda* the God of death is only *yama* and not *Rudra”*. This is the expositon by some scholars. Is it acceptable to the *śāstras*?

Answer: It is not acceptable to the *śāstras*. Even though *yama* is the *devatā* of death, it is only *Rudradeva* who is the great destroyer. This is the definite opinion of the *Vedas* and *śāstras*. That is why he is prayed -as follows:—“O God, do not separate us from seeing *Sūryadeva* \(मा नः सूर्यस्य सन्दृशो युयोथाः२-३३-१-१५ ऋग्वेद\)

“Do not destroy our elders, children, our cattle, parents and the dear body of ours people.”

> मा नो महान्तमुत मा नो अर्भकं मा न उक्षन्तमुत मा न उक्षितम् ।   
> मा नो वधीः पितरं मोत मातरं मा नः प्रियास्तन्वो रुद्र रीरिषः ॥   
\(ऋग्वेद 1-114/1-111\) 

“When destroying thus, he makes everyone cry, and so he is *‘Rudra’*. “रोदयतीति रुद्रः”, or because he cried, he is *Rudra*. “यदरोदीत्तद्रुद्रस्य रुद्रत्वं.” This explanation itself is acceptable to the science of grammar and the science of language. Interpretation of words should conform to the *pramāṇagranthas* like the *Vedas*, *śāstras*, *purāṇas*, *Itihāsas* etc, and *vedāṅgas* like grammar, *nirukta,* and to the experience of the great *yogis,* and not just according to linguistics. The modern theories of linguistics can not be definite evidences. “Philological laws work blindly”.

Question 13: *Śiva* is called as *Hāṭakeśvara* also in some holy places of pilgrimage. Here the word *‘Hāṭaka’* is derived from the word *‘Hāṭṭikāra’. Haṭṭikāras* are Dravidians. Therefore *Śiva* must be originally a Dravidian god only, isn’t it?

Answer: The word *Haṭaka* has not originated from the word *Haṭṭikāra*. It gives the sense of gold only, and not a *Haṭṭikāra* \(a cowherd\). Gold is called *‘hāṭaka’* because it is effulgent. It is derived from the root *“Haṭa dīptau”*. As *Śiva* shines like gold *“Hiraṇyamiva Rocate,”* he is called *‘hāṭakeśvara’* This is clear from the word-sense relationship and it leaves little doubt here. So it is most incoherent to relate *‘Hāṭakeśvara’* with the word *‘Haṭṭikāra’.* It is as ridiculous as saying that the word ‘cottage’ in “English has originated from the Kannada word *‘Kottige,* and like saying “Englishmen changed the word *‘tamasā’* which is the name of a river of our country to ‘Thames’. The word *‘Hāṭakeśvara’* as the *Vedas* describe, makes us understand the golden effulgence, immutability and great preciousness of *Śiva*.

Question14: *Śiva devatā* was prodminently a worshipful deity for the *yaduturvasus.* The *yaduturcasus* are *haṭṭikāras*, \(cowherds\) who were Dravidians. So, at least the theory that *Śiva* is a god of *Drāviḍas* is correct, isn’t it?

Answer: It is certainly not correct, and there is no doubt that this argument is wrong. *“Yaduturvasus”* were the *kshatriyaputras* of the great king *Yayāti* who was a supreme *kshatriya* born in *Devayāni,* the daughter of sage *Śukracārya*. It is very clearly said in *Itihāsas* and *purāṇas* that they lost \(the right to rule\) the kingdom because of their disobedience to their father. They were *kshatriyas* only and not cowherds. *Yādavas* became kings of *Madhurā* in course of time. *Kauravas* and *Pānḍavas* had \(marital\) relationship with them. How can they be cowherds?

Question 15: But *Yādava Śrī Kṛshṇa* belongs to the *Gopālaka* \(cowherds\) caste, Isn’t it?

Answer: *Nanda* and *Yashoda,* were *Vaiśyas* \(by birth\) but *gopālaks* by profession, and brought him up in his childhood. But his parents, *Vasudeva* and *Devaki* were *Kshatriyas* only. After killing *Kamsa, Śrī Kṛshṇa* also followed the *Kshatriya* profession only, which was natural to his caste.

Question 16: In Karnataka, *Śiva* is also called by such names as *Mallayya, Malleśa*, and *Parvatappa* etc. The word *Mallāri* means *Indra* the *vaidik*a *devatā* who is the enemy of mountains. *Śiva* the Lord of mountains being his challenger and referred to as *‘Malleśa’* must be a god of Dravidians Isn’t it ?

Answer: There is no substance at all in this interpretation. It is associated with an imagination of a wrong meaning. Calling *Śiva* as *‘Mallayya’* and *‘Malleśa’* is based on the famous meanings of *samskṛta* words viz., *‘Girīśa’* and *‘Giriśa’*. While the word *‘malleśa’* appears in Kannada language, the words *‘Girīsha’* and *‘Giriśa’* appear in *Vedic* literature itself, considered by scholars to be the oldest known litereature in the world. The opinion that the word *‘Mallāri’* denotes *Indra* is also not correct. It only denotes *Śrī Kṛshṇa*, the enemy of *Mallas* \(wrestlers\). It is well known that *Śrī Kṛshṇa* defeated and killed *Chāṇuramalla* and got the name *‘Mallamardana’*. Though *Indra* is famous as the enemy of mountains, he becomes their friend, after he broke their arrogance. In the *Vedas* we come across the name *‘Indrāparvata’*, which is related to two deities. As per the *Vedas*, *Vishṇu* has Lordship over the mountains. *“Vishṇuh parvatānāmadhipatih”*. Both *Indra* and *Vishṇu* are friends of *Śiva*, and not his enemies. The word *Mallāri* is in usage to denote *Śiva* also. It is because *Śiva* is the enemy of demon wrestlers such as *Andhakāsura, Tripurāsura* etc. In this way the words *Mallāri* and *Giriśa* match both *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*. And, it is indeed a foolish adventure to prove that *Śiva* is a *drāviḍa devatā* basing the argunment merely on the word *‘malleśa’*.

Question 17: The *Vedas* have called *Rudra* as the father of *Maruts*. “आ ते पितर्मरुतां सुम्नमेतु” The *‘Maruts’* were forest dwellers who were giving *marundu* i.e. medicines to people. They are also called *‘Kaḷḷas* \(thives\). It is stated in the *Rudramantra* that *Śiva* is “स्तेनानां पतिः” i.e. ‘Lord of thieves’. Therefore *Śiva*-*Rudra* is the god of Dravidians only, isn’t it?

Answer: *Śiva* is not the Lord of the thieves only. He is also the Lord of pious tradesmen and also *sthapatis* \(carpenters\). “स्थपतये वृक्षाणां पतये नमः नमो मन्त्रिणे वाणिजाय”. This says that *Śiva* is indeed *Viśvarūpi Bhagavān* and does not mean to say that he is just the Lord of the tribe of thieves. It is also wrong to interpret that all Dravidians are thieves and cheats stated by the words *‘śtena’* and *“Vancate parivancate”* It won’t be a matter of pride for Dravidians either. As in the words of *Sruti* “सर्वो वै रुद्रः तस्मै रुद्राय नमो अस्तु”, this also tells the expansion of universal form of *Śiva*. Like the *purushasūkta* which praises the glory of the omnipresence of *Purusha Nārāyaṇa* in “पुरुष एवेदं सर्वम्”. this *Rudrādhyāya* praises the grandeur of the omnipresence of *Rudra*.

The word *‘Maruttaru’* is not related to the word *‘marundu’* which denotes medicine. The narrative of *‘Saptamāruta’* which appears in *Itihāsas* and *purāṇas* makes it clear that the word means ‘Those who should not cry’. And, there is no proof at all to say that the story of *“Sapthamāruta”* is of recent origin, and *‘marundu’* and *‘Maruta’* are ancient.

Question 18: Then how did the relationship of father and son come to pass between *Rudradeva* and *Maruddevatās*?

Answer: *Maruts* are *Vāyudevatās*. They are the presiding deity of even the vital life breaths \(*praṇa vāyu*\). *Rudra*-*Śiva* is “प्राणाधिपः कृत्तिवासाः पिनाकी” and in the words of *Śrutis,* he is “प्राणस्य प्राणम्” i.e. the Lord of all these \(vital life breaths\) too.

Question 19: In the Dravida \(country\) the tradition of *trishashṭimaruts* i.e. the sixty-three ancient great *Śaiva* devotees is still in practice. But, as the tradition of ‘त्रिषष्टिः मरुतर’ त्रिषष्टिः त्वा मरुतः” \(*Ṛgveda* 8-96-8\) has not continued among the vaidikas, those *maruts* must be Dravidians only, isn’t it?

Answer: Those sixty three ancients have continued even in the *vaidik* a class. The *Kenopanishat* tells us that they are the sixty three *vidyādevatās* who preside over each of these sixty three branches of \(knowledge\). The deity of *Brahma Vidya* \(which is the sixty fourth\) is Goddess *‘Umāhaimavatī’* herself. The *Kālikā Purāṇa* states “The sixty three *vidyās,* if taken independently, give trivial benefits. The sixty fourth, the *Brahmavidya* bestows *Amṛtattva*

> क्षुद्राः त्रिषष्टिविद्याःस्युः तत्फलं नश्वरं भवेत् ।   
> चतुष्षष्टितमी ब्रह्मविद्यात्वमृतदायिनी ॥ 

Therefore the argument that it was Dravidians who continued the tradition of sixty three ancients, and that their God is *Śiva*-*Rudra*, is without any substance. Even though the *prāṇas* have been divided into five, seven, ten and twenty one etc., the sixty three *devatas* of *vidyā* are the *śaktis* and *upaśaktis* only of *‘Praṇadeva’*.

Question 20: Dravidians normally wear *Rumālu* \(a particular type of headgear\). In *Ṛgveda, Maruts* and *Rudradeva* have been described as *ushṇīshī.* \(A person who wears a turban\) Therefore *Maruts* and *Rudradeva* must be Dravidians only, isn’t it?

Answer: Even North Indians regard the wearing of a turban as a mark of honor. Even the *vaidik* as there do not perform auspicious rituals without wearing the turban. *Mahābhārata* says that when the arrow of *Karṇa* spirited away *Arjuna’s* crown, *Arjuna* immediately wrapped a white turban around his head. The *Vedic literature also says* “लोहितोष्णीषा ऋत्विजः प्रचरन्ति” meaning *“Ṛtviks* wearing red colored turbans are walking around”. Therefore the wearing of turbans is not the distinctiveness of Dravidians only. Thus, it is not correct to argue that *Maruts* and *Rudra*-*Śiva* are the exclusive gods of Dravidians.

Question 21: In the *Vedas* the worshippers of *Liṅga* \(the god of *phallus*\) are called enemies of *Aryans*.

“मा शिश्नदेवाः असिशुः ऋतं नः \(ऋग्वेद 7-21-5\)”

“वेदघ्नान् शिश्नदेवान् अभिवर्पसा भूत्”

But Dravidians have been worshipping *Śiva* in the form of *Liṅga* for ages. Even in Harappa and Mohenjadaro cultures, we see the marks of the worship of *Liṅga*. Therefore is it not justified to say that the *phallus* shaped *Śiva*-*Rudra* was the god of *anaryas* \(i.e. Dravidians\) earlier, and later was accepted by the Aryans?

Answer: The condemnation of god of phallus in the *Vedas* is not the condemnation of the worship of *Śivaliṅga*. It is only the libidinous who are always attached to the pleasures of the procreating organs, who think that those organs are the ultimate goal in life who are censured here, and it is not the worship of *Śiva* in the form of *Liṅga* that is condemned here. Even in the *Upanishats*, *Śiva* is referred to as a form of *Liṅga*.

Question 22: Though it is true that *Śiva* is praised in *‘MahāNārāyaṇaopanishat’* as “ऊर्ध्वलिङ्गाय नमः, हिरण्यलिङ्गाय नमः”, it cannot be held as authentic, as that *upanishad* is of recent origin.

Q: Is their any evidence to claim that upanishat is modern?

Answer: It is considered modern because ancient *ācāryas* like *Śankara Bhagavatpāda* and others have not writeen commentaries on it.

**The answer of the *Siddhanti*:-** This argument is not corrcet. Even though *Śrī Śankaracārya* and others have not written a gloss on *‘Mahānārāyaṇopanishat’,* ancient sages like *Āpastamba, Bodhāyana* and others have honored it. They have called it “याज्ञिकी उपनिषत्” and there is the practice of giving libations to its Gods in their *sūtra* treatises. This is also included in the *‘Navakānḍaṛshitarpaṇa’*. The custom of studying and teaching this *upanaishat* with intonation is also there. *Sandhyāvandana*, *Vaiśvadeva* and *baliharaṇa mantras* have also adorned this *upanishat*. Therefore it is one among the ancient *upanishats* which are honored by great sages such as *Bodhāyana, Āpastamba* and others.

‘Then why is the praise of *Śivaliṅga* appearing in *upanishats* not authentic? The answer is ‘Because it is modern’. Why is it modern? The answer is ‘It is because the praise of *Śivaliṅga* is there which is a modern concept. This type of an answer is called *anyoynāyāśrayadushta.*

Question 23: May be that God *Rudra* -*Śiva* is an honourable deity in the *Vedas*. But since god *Liṅgadeva* is clearly condemened in the *Ṛgveda*, can we not say that the worship of *Liṅga* has come from the class of *anāryas*?

Answer: It is not correct to say so. As we have expounded earlier, it is not the worshippers of *Śivaliṅga* that are condemned in the *Vedas*, but the worshippers of the sense organs.

One may ask—“Is there any evidence in the *samskṛta* language where the word *“śiśnadevāh”* is interpreted to mean the worshippers of sense organs \(and not the worshippers of *Śivaliṅga*\)?” The answer is, ‘yes and without any doubt’. Our spiritual treatises call those who are sheer seekers of sensual pleasures as *‘śiśnodaraparāyanās’*, and consider them inferior.

Question 24: Just as the word *‘Liṅga’* in *samskṛta* denotes the procreative organ, it also has other meanings, such as “a mark” and “a subtle form.” In *Śvetāśvatharopanishad,* in the usage *“Naiva ca liṅganāśah”* the meaning of the word *Liṅga* is “subtle form” only. *Śrīśankarācārya* has commented that the word *“liṅgasya* stands for *sūkshmarūpasya”*. Not only this. The word *‘Liṅga śarīra’*, stands for subtle body only, in our spiritual treatises. Again, *“Na liṅgam dharma kāraṇam”* means, an external mark will not be a reason for *dharma*. When it is so, why should the word *Liṅga* be interpreted to mean only the procreative organ? It is possible that the custom of worshipping *Śiva* has come to indicate that *Śiva* is subtle in form, and he is minuter than the minute. Or, that he is formless, isn’t it? The word ‘Lī’ in Sanskrit also means to go and unite with, and to hide. As the whole universe merges in *Śiva*, or as *Rudra*-*Śiva* is the god of dissolution, the custom of worshipping *Śiva* as the form of *“Liṅga”* might have come; isn’t it? What all this means is that, all these meanings for the word *‘Liṅga’* were given at later times. Originally it meant the procreative organ only.

The argument that the *Liṅga* that is worshipped is not the phallus, is dismissed by the shape of the *Liṅga* itself. From the time of *mohenjodaro, Liṅga*s in the shape \(form\) of *phallus* are available. In the *Śiva* temple of *‘Gudimallāpura’* which belongs to to the second century AD, the *Liṅga* is completely in the shape of the phallus. Devotees of *Śiva* say that it is not auspicious to worship the *Liṅga* only and, only the *Liṅga* along with the *śakti pīṭha \(prakṛti pīṭha, yoni pīṭha*\) is fit for worship. Though the exalted *tattvik* feeling that *Liṅga* and *śakti pīṭhas* are symbolic of the united form of *‘Purusha* and-*Prakṛti* the creators of the universe came later, fundamentally the words *Liṅga* and *yoni* mean the physical organs of procreation.

The original concept of this *liṅgadevatā* existed in the *Astroasiatic* tribe. Those who belonged to that tribe used to wear the *Liṅga* as a sign of protection. The people of *Śākta* sect in Bengal took that concept from them. Then the *Śaiva Drāviḍas* sect took that concept also from them into their relgion and brought harmony between *Śivadeva* and *Liṅgadeva”*.—So says a recent critical work by name *‘Śiva rahasya’*. Is not this argument of this book correct?

Answer: There is no doubt that in *samskṛta* the meaning “procreative organ” for the word *‘Liṅga’* is very much there.

One can agree that it is only in a special sense the relation of oneness between God and that sense organ has been conceived. But there is no evidence whatsoever to state that it was borrowed from the Astroasiatic race by the *Śāktas* and *Śaivas.*

Question 25: It is disgusting to imagine the sameness between God the formless, and the procreative organ. And therefore it would be correct to interpret *Śivaliṅga* as the symbol of God who is formless God or who is subtle in form, isn’t it?

Answer: The *śāstras* propound the worship of many such symbols of god. But there is no *moksha* for the worshippers of symbols. As is evident from the words “अप्रतीकोपासकान्नयतीति बादरायणः” \(*Brahmasūtra* 4.3.15\) *śāstras* declare that the worship of symbols does not give the benefit of permanent *Mukti*. The *Śaiva purāṇas* proclaim that if the worship of *Śivaliṅga* is performed in accordance with the precepts, *jnāna* is obtained and from that *moksha* will be accomplished. Therefore, the meaning of *Śivaliṅga* is conceived as a *pratīka*, only recently. Such commentaries have emerged with the feeling that it is disgusting to imagine the sameness between *Śiva* and the organ of procreation.

Question 26: In that case, how is it appropriate to equte the never changing and the pure *Paramātman* with the procreative organ? What is wrong in understanding him that the never changing and pure is a symbol of God who is subtle and has no form?

Answer: There is no doubt that God is very subtle and is the form of divine bliss and knowledge. But the *Liṅga* which the *Jnānis* have recommended to worship is one of the divine forms clearly beheld in the inner vision by the pure souled *yogis*. *Yogis* see that divine *Liṅga* in the inner spiritual centers viz- *Mūlādhāra, Hṛdaya, Bhrūmadhya* etc., and shed all the common blemishes and attain divine knowledge.

> मध्यमे च हृदयस्य ललाटे   
> स्थाणुवज्ज्वलति लिङ्गमदृश्यम् ।   
> अस्ति गार्गि परमार्थमिदं तत्   
> पश्य पश्य मनसा शिवरूपम् ॥ 

When the treatises on *Yoga* clearly state—‘Behold\! Behold\! Lord *Śiva* in the form of *Liṅga’* which is evident from the above *sloka,* why interpret it only as a symbol? Why should one imagine a thing which is directly seen, as only a *pratīka* of that? It is a form of *Liṅga* which is full of effulgence. It is most sacred. There is not even an iota of *samskāra* in that \(*Liṅga*\) which make the senses to plummet. Those whose senses have a downward tendency will never be able to see that. **We humbly remember here with gratitude one of the teachings of *Śrīraṅgamahāguru*, a supreme *Yogi* who had enlightened us on *Sāligrama* and *Śiva Liṅga*s in a session. He had said-“observe that the *Śiva Liṅga* which the *Jnānis* have asked us to worship is always facing upwards.** This is related to the path of salvation. As evident from the *śloka* “ज्ञानिनां ऊर्ध्वगो भवति अज्ञानिनां अधोमुखः । एवं वै प्रणवस्तिष्ठेत् यस्तं वेद स वेदवित्”, It is the *Śivaliṅga* which has the deportment of the upward *praṇava*. As said in “ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्थाः”, it provides the upward movement for the *śuddha sāttvikas* who keep spiritually moving up. It is a divine form that takes the devotees towards the most high deportment, like the eye on the forehead of *Śivanaṭarāja* and the *Ūrdhvapunḍra of MahāVishṇu.* The *Mahābhārata* proclaims its upward movement only. “भस्मदग्धोर्ध्वलिङ्गाय” \(*Mahābhārata*-*Bhīshmastavarāja\)*. It is the divine *Liṅga* of *Mahādeva.* When the *Liṅga* move downwards, it leads to the growth of *samsāra* and when *yogis* get upward in deep meditation, it leads to liberation from *samsāra*. Though the worship of *Liṅga* is prescribed in the worship of *Śiva*, in reality it is composed of *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Rudra*. And the great *yogis* worship such an upward *liṅga* which consists of the trinity and which is full of effulgence. Don’t join the group of *Pāmaras* who measure that divine form which is *Śuddhabuddha* and which is seen naturally in a divine state that has no touch of the *samskāras* of both *puṇya* and *pāpa*, with their unrefined knowledge. Don’t descend to the life of a beast by looking at *Pashupati* with a beastly mindset. There are of course other paths other than this worship of *Śivaliṅga* to attain the state of *Parabrahma* that are supremely high. But there is no doubt that this too, i.e. the *upāsana* of *Śivaliṅg* a is also a *yogamārga”*. We wish to declare that it is not wise to interpret matters which have emerged from the *tattvabhūmi* of *Jnānis*, merely from the level of *manobhūmi* which is an abode of *Saṅkalpa, Vikalpa* and *āgrahas*.

Question 27: Then what is the fate of the opinions based on the study of linguistics and the history of the Dravidian and Austro-Asiatic race?

Answer: Such opinions which evolve in that field, develop there, and after projecting the agitations and cleverness as some \(new\) light, play some deranged games and finally \(die and\) get buried there itself. And, now and then, they raise their heads and later meet the same fate again and again. The *Śivaliṅga* which the *Jnānis* have asked us to worship belongs to the realm which is beyond the senses and so, any description pertaining to that realm should be obtained there in the suprasensory field itself. It should be visualized there itself, and bliss should be experienced. Any person belonging to any race of any time period, can experience it with the light of his own self, when he ascends to the realm of divine knowledge. It will be nothing but unofficiousness to attribute it to any one particular race belonging to a particular period.

The conclusions based on anthropology, linguistics, material sciences and intellectual knowledge which only lead to increase in doubts and \(ever\) changing opinions.

		
Question 28: “In *Rudrādhyāya* it has been stated that *Rudra* is the Lord of the thieves. *“Stenānām patih”*, The thieves that are mentioned here are not the ordinary thieves who loot from houses, but an ancient race by name *‘kaḷavara’*. These people are from the Kannada Country. They were opposed to *yajnas* and used to steal the cows belonging to the Aryans performing the *yajnas*. They were *Anāryas*. As these people were *kaḷavaras* \(thieves\), their God also was called *“Stenānām pathih*“ i.e. the Lord of thieves. So, *Rudra* must be basically a non-Aryan God”-This is the argument of some ultramodern \(scholars\). Is this argument correct?

Answer: It is totally wrong. *Rudra* is not called the Lord of thieves only. “कुलालेभ्यः कर्मारेभ्यश्च वो नमः”. Even the potters and blacksmiths are called as the *gaṇas* of *Rudra*. *Rudra* is the Lord of these also. If the above said *‘kaḷavaru’* belong to the Kannada country, then to which country these potters and black smiths belong? Are they Telugus? Or Tamils? This has to be explained. Actually speaking, thieves or potters or blacksmiths do not belong to a particular area only. They are found in all regions. All people of all classes of all the countries are the forms of *Rudra* only. Here the natural meaning is that *Rudra* is indeed the omnipresent Lord. The question of *Ārya-Drāviḍa* does not arise here at all. People practicing the above said occupations are found in all races and in all the countries.

Question 29: The concept that *Śiva* is omnipresent is of recent origin. Therefore it should be interpreted that he is the *devatā* of ‘Kaḷḷar’, a non-Aryan race isn’t it?

Answer: That *Rudra* is omnipresent is an eternal truth. In *ŚrīRudrādhyāya*, not only *Rudra* but also his attendants who can assume any form at \(will\), are called ‘विरूपेभ्यो विश्वरूपेभ्यश्च वो नमः’ The *Rudragaṇas* of various forms are *‘ghora’*, *‘Aghora’* and *‘Ghoratara’* etc.

Question 30: In Kannada language, the saying *“Avanu Rudra Helidanu”* \(He recited *Rudra*\) means “He committed a theft”. So, can we interpret the word *Rudra* to mean ‘God of thieves’ and ‘God of Kannadigas’ and *“Stenānām patih”*?

Answer: It is neither an honest meaning of that nor a serious interpretation. No doubt the name of theft appears in the *Rudramantra*. *Rudra* is called the Lord of thieves. Therefore to interpret the word *‘Rudrapārāyaṇa’* to mean stealing amounts to a derisive interpretation only, and cannot be an honest meaning. For example: Virtuous people do *‘Gītāpārāyaṇa’* in the morning. And people who are addicted to play the game of cards may play cards in the morning also. Therefore in the derisive sense, the words ‘doing *Gītāpārāyaṇa’*, have come to mean ‘Playing cards’. Why should one associate the supremely pious Lord whom the *Vedas* praise as *Viśvādhika* and *Rudramaharshi* with theft?” Thieves, torturers, robbers and potters are all forms of *Rudra* only. It just means that *Rudra* is indeed omnipresent.

Question 31: We shall present a strong reason to state that *Rudra* was a God of Non-Aryans. The devotees of *Rudra* are called *‘kannaru’* also. *Kaṇṇaru* is another form of *‘Kaḷḷaru’ ‘kaḷavaru’*. Is not *Kaṇṇappa* a very grerat devotee of *Śiva*? He indeed belongs to the *‘kaḷavara’*, group i.e. the group of *‘Kaḷḷas’* \(thieves\) i.e. the group of the devotees of *Śiva* of the Kannada country. *Rāvaṇa* an outstanding devotee of *Śiva*, was also a great thief. He justifies as correct his kidnapping of *Sita*. He was also opposed to the *yajnas* that were being performed by *Ārya*-*maharshis*. All these are *Anāryas*. Therefore we establish that basically *Śiva* was the God of *Anāryas* only. How will you oppose this argument?

Answer: It is not at all a *Siddhānta*. It is only a weak argument. There is no rule that the word *‘Kaṇṇaru’* must be the other form of the word *‘Kaḷḷaru’*. In the Tamil \(*Drāviḍa*\) language, the word *‘Kaṇṇa’* is derived from the word *‘Kṛshṇa’*. It may mean a dark complexioned person. We hear the story that, the famous devotee of *Śiva* by name *Kaṇṇappa*, offered his eyes \(*kaṇṇu*\) to Lord *Śiva* and so he came to be called *Kaṇṇappa*. Even if you do not accept this story, it is possible that *Kaṇṇappa* is the other form of *Kṛshṇappa*. One cannot prove that *Bedara Kannappa* was from Kannada Country only. He is treated as one among the great devotees of *Śiva* in the Tamil Country also. The word *‘Kaḷ’* in Tamil means “Liquor’. Therefore the word *‘Kaḷḷappa’* can also mean an alcoholic, or one who sells liquor. Instead of this, it is better to interpret it as ‘the one who offered his *‘Kaṇṇu’*, or the one who is of a dark complexion. In Telugu, Ḷa \(ळ\) replaces ṇa\(ण\) n *Sandhi.* So, the word *‘Kaḷḷajodu’* is used in the Telugu language for spectacles. Therefore even if he is called *‘Kaḷḷappa’*, it means a great man who gave the *kaṇṇu* \(eyes\). Thus, giving up the natural meaning and saying that *‘Kaḷḷa’* \(thief\) is the basic meaning for the word *Kaṇṇu* amounts to a mean adventure indulged by you.

“Your interpretaion that *Rāvaṇa* was a devotee of *Rudra* and was a thief, and therefore all the devotees of *Rudra* were only thieves earlier who stole the cattle of Aryans and were opposed to *yajnas* is not correct. Because there is no mention in the *purāṇas* that *Bāṇāsura,* and *Candikeśvara* who are considered *Mahā pāśupatas,* like *Rāvaṇa*, had committed theft. They are also not ill famed as the ones opposed to *yajnas*. Even though *Rāvaṇa* was creating troubles for the *yajnas* of the sages, he himself was performing *tāmasa yajnas*. He was learned in the *Vedas* which are a treasure of knowledge of the *aryamaharshīs.* And, above it *Śiva* was never opposed to *yajnas*. In temples of *Śiva*, the deer in the hand of the *utsavamūrtī*, is the form of *‘Yajna’* only. *Śiva* is indeed its protector. *Śiva* destroyed the *yajna* of *Dakshaprajāpati* only because it was *Aśāstrīya* and was performed with arrogance, and not that *Śiva* was opposed to all *yajnas*. Therefore your argument that all the devotees of *Śiva* were thieves earlier, were opposed to *yajnas,* and *Rudra*-*Śiva* also is the king of Non-Aryan thieves, is absurd. The outstanding devotees of *Śiva*, such as *Mārkanḍeya, Vyāghrapāda*, and *Upamanyu*- were neither thieves or Non-Aryans.

Macdonold and some others say that the word *‘Marut’* which means ‘to shine’ has been derived from *‘Mar’*. They are called *‘Pavamāna’* as they have the ability to produce sound in air. There is no evidence to say that they are non-Aryans. Because, they help *Indra,* the great god of *Aryans*, in the slaying of *vṛttrāsura*. There is a mention that without joining *Indra*, they on their own tore open the tissues of joints of the demon *‘Vṛttra’* and released the cows. How can the non-Aryan tribes accomplish this work of the *devatās*? They are called *‘asuras’* \(*asūnrānti, asushu ramante, śatrūṇām nirasitārah*\) because they protect the \(*prāṇas*\) or because they are strong or enjoy in the *prāṇas* or because they drive away the enemies. God *varuṇa* has been called *‘Asura Pracetah’*. He is not a non-Aryan *devata* at all. Why then should the *‘Maruddevatās’* be crowned as non-Aryan?

Question 32: In the *Ṛgveda* it is seen that the number of *Maruts* has been considered as sixty three ‘त्रिषष्टिः त्वामरुतः Actually speaking, the word *Trishashṭi* is not a Sanskrit word that gives the sense of the number 63. The words *‘Tirasaṭa’, ‘Trisaṭṭi’* and *‘Tirasaṭṭi’* mean those who are irritable \(short tempered\), strange, and a set of people of the third path which is different from others. This suggests that they belong to a peculiar path of the non-Aryans as different from the path of Aryans. Therefore, the *Maruts* and their father *Rudra*, who have these attributives, must be non-Aryans only, isn’t it?

Answer: This is nothing but the method of squeezing with difficulty a meaning from a word rather than taking the meaning which naturally arises from a word. The word *Trishashṭi* is only a numeral and not \(at all\) an adjective. The number of the *Rudra gaṇa* is stated as *‘Ekavimśati’* \(21\) in one place and *‘trishashṭi’* \(63\), in another place in the *Vedas,* and so it is a word denoting only a number. Therefore, mistaking it for a Kannada word and interpreting it to mean people of strange nature is untenable here. The Jains also refer to 63 great men in their community called ‘ancient *śalākāpurshas’*. Among ancient *Śaivas,* there is a reference to 63 ancients. *Maruts* are also 63 in number. This vedic number 63 of the *Maruts* has been adopted by *Jains* as well. Here 63 is the number of persons whereas there, they are the representatives of sixty-three \(*vidyās*\). They are the \(attendants\) of the sixty fourth \(*vidyā*\) i.e. the *Brahmavidya*. All the sixty-three *vidyā*s will lead to *Śiva* only who is the sixty-fourth and the form of spiritual knowledgede which is the sixtyfourth. All of them are his progeny only.

> क्षुद्राः त्रिषष्टिविद्याः स्युः तत्फलं नश्वरं भवेत् ।   
> चतुष्षष्टितमी ब्रह्मविद्यात्वमृतदायिनी ॥ 

As evident from the words “ईशानस्सर्वविद्यानां” *Śiva* is the Lord of all these *vidyā*s.

Thus the word *trishasṭi* here is just the number 63 and certainly is not an adjective standing for the meanings viz. *‘tirasaṭa’*, strange, or the one whose path is *anārya* as different from the path of the *Āryas*.

After making a study of all the accounts mentioned above, a natural conclusion that can be drawn is that *Rudra*-*Śiva* is *Mahādeva*. He is not just a god of some race, but is *shvara* who is the Lord of all the living beings, He is the Lord who is expounded in the *Vedas*, *smṛtis, Itihāsas* and *Āgamas* and worshipped by the *vaidika*, *Tāntrika* and *vaidik-Tāntrika* and many other paths, and fortunate persons who specially worship him on the day of *Mahāśivarātri* as per precepts, will obtain all the *Purushārthas*.





	 
## Saṅkrānti \(*Makara Saṅkrānti, Uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*\)

**The name and significance of this *parva***:—*Saṅkrānti* is one of the most important festivals of the *Sanātana Ārya Bhāratiyas.* In scriptures it is called by other names such as *Saṅkrānti, Makarasaṅkrānti, Makarasaṅkramaṇa, Makarasaṅkramaṇa*, and *Uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla* also. In Tamil Nadu it is called *Pongal*. Common people also call this as *‘Ellina Habba’*. Though the distribution of sesame is in vougue in the next festival also i.e. *‘rathasaptamī’*, it is only *Saṅkrānti* which is renownedly associated with the significance and fame pertaining to the gifting of sesame, and thus is well known as *Eḷḷina habba*. The Kannada proveb *“Eḷḷu bellava tindu oḷḷeya māthanāḍu’* owes it’s origin to this festival.

The entire *uttarāyaṇa* is very dear to deities, and auspicious for *Devakāryas* and auspicious functions. The *śāstras* purport that it is best to perform auspicious functions such as *caula, upanayana, vratacatushṭaya* which is done at the end of *Brahmacarya, Godāna* and marriage etc., during this time, which is dear to the *devatās*.

उदगयन पूर्वपक्षाहः पुण्याहेषु कार्याणि \(आपस्तम्ब गृह्य 12\) 

> उदगयने आपूर्यमाणपक्षे कल्याणे नक्षत्रे

> उदगयन आपूर्यमाणपक्षे पुण्याहे कुमार्याः  
> पाणिं गृणीयाद्यालक्षणसंपन्ना स्यात्” \(जैमिनि V-8-23\) 

It is natural that this day of *Makara Saṅkrānti* on which the *uttarāyaṇa* begins, is regarded highly in the *śāstra*s and in traditions. Scriptures declare that religious and spiritual activities such as bath, meditation, gifting, *Homa*, worship of Gods, *tarpaṇa* and *śrāddha* etc performed with faith and devotion, fetch greatest benefits. And, *jnāni*s preach that those who abstain from the above said sacred deliberations and indulge in unholy acts, will incur worst sins.

> सङ्क्रान्त्यां पक्षयोरन्ते ग्रहणे चन्द्रसूर्ययोः।  
> गङ्गास्नातो नरः कामात् ब्रह्मणःसदनं व्रजेत्॥ \(भविष्यपुराण\)

> पुरा मकरसन्क्रान्तौ शङ्करो गोसवे कृते।  
> तिलानुत्पादयामास तृप्तये सर्वदेहिनाम्॥ 

\(विष्णुधर्मोत्तर and शिवरहस्य\) 

Even making gifts on the night of this day is very auspicious.

The term *Saṅkrānti* \(*saṅkrama, saṅkramaṇa*\) means, the sun appearing to move from one *rāśi* \(a division of the zodiac\) to another.

> रवेः सङ्क्रमणम् राशौ सङ्क्रान्तिरिति कथ्यते।  
> स्नानदानतपःश्राद्धहोमादिषु महाफला॥  
> मेषादिषु द्वादशराशिषु क्रमेण संसरतः सूर्यस्य  
> पूर्वस्माद्राशेः उत्तरराशौ सङ्कमणम् प्रवेशः सङ्क्रान्तिः। 

It is not just the Sun that moves from one *rāśi* to the other, but the planets also enter into stars and *rāśi*s, during this auspicious time of *Saṅkrānti* only.

Even then, it is customary to specially call the movement of the sun alone from one *rāśi* to another as *Saṅkrānti*.

> न केवलमादित्यस्यैव सङ्क्रमायने पुण्यकालः।  


> किन्तु सर्वेषां ग्रहाणां नक्षत्रराशिसङ्क्रमे पुण्य -  
कालो भवति सर्वग्रहाणां राश्यन्तरसङ्क्रमण -  
वाचिनोऽपि सङ्क्रान्ति शब्दस्य-सङ्क्रान्तेः पुण्यकालस्तु  
> षोडशोभयतः कलाः इत्यादि शास्त्रे रविसङ्क्रमण मात्रपरत्वम् ।\(स्मृतिकौमुदी\) 

These *Saṅkrāntis* are twelve in number viz - *Mesha, Vṛshabha, Mithuna, Kaṭaka \(Karkātaka\), Simha, Kanya, Tulā, Vṛścika, Dhanus, Makara, Kumbha* and *Mīna*.

Among these, *kaṭaka* and *Makara saṅkramaṇas* are *ayana Saṅkrāntis* and *Mesha* and *Tulā* are *Vishuva saṅkrāntis. Mithuna, kanyā, Dhanus* and *Mīna saṅkramaṇas* are *Shaḍaśīti* or *shaḍaśītimukha Saṅkrāntis* and *Vṛshabha, simha, vṛscika* and *kumbhasaṅkramaṇas* are classified as *Vishṇupadī* or *Vishṇupadasaṅkrāntis*. Though the *saṅkramaṇas* are twelve in number, common people refer to *Makara—Saṅkrānti* alone as *Saṅkrānti*, because of its exceptional sacredness.

Those who cannot afford to observe other *Saṅkrāntis* must necessarily observe this *Saṅkrānti*. Thus *Makara Saṅkrānti* is a *Parva Viśesha*, renowned as the holiest of the holy.

This *parva* is called *uttarāyaṇapuṇyakāla*, as it is an auspicious moment from which the sun God \(*SūryaNārāyaṇa*\) begins his journey from south to north \(*uttarāyaṇa*\). This is famous in Tamilnadu as *‘pongal’* as it is the day on which milk is boiled and made to overflow, as per a special precept. The custom of common people calling it, *‘eḷḷina habba’* has come into vogue, as it is the day on which sesame is mixed with jaggery and other condiments, and gifted and consumed also.

ii\) When and at what time should this be observed?

*Saṅkrānti* is a *sauramāna* festival. It’s observance is on the first day of the month of *Makara*. According to the lunar calendar it falls in the month of *pushya*. The festival occurs generally on one of the days i.e. on the 12th, or 13th or on the 14th of January. Even though it may be stated approximately as the day of the festival of *Saṅkrānti*, it is difficult to decide the precise moment at which this *puṇyakāla* should be observed \(by means of *jnāna, dāna, dhyāna*, and *tarpaṇa* etc.\) The specific *kālaviśesha* at which the sun enters one zodiac from the other is extremely subtle. It is as minute as the one thousandth part of a *truti*. It cannot be made out by people with the help of ordinary eyes. Only *yogis* can notice it. As it is impossible for ordinary people to detect that important time, they should perform the rituals at a suitable time which is very close to it, either just earlier to that or just after that. Scriptures state that closer the time of observances to the time of *Saṅkrānti*, better are the results.

> सङ्क्रान्तिसमयस्सूक्ष्मः दुर्ज्ञेयः पिशितेक्षणैः। \(देवल\) 

> त्रुटेः सहस्रभागो यः स कालो रविसङ्क्रमे। \(देवीपुराण\) 

> अतः अनुष्ठाने मुख्यकालासम्भवात्  


> सङ्क्रान्तिसम्बन्धिनौ पूर्वोत्तरकालौ गृहीतव्यौ \(कालनिर्णय-हेमाद्रि\)  


> या याः सन्निहिता नाड्यः तास्ताः पुण्यतमाः स्मृताः \(शातातपस्मृति\) 

The time duration of thirty *nāḍis* before the onset of *saṅkramaṇa* and immediately after that are very sacred. Sixty *ghaṭikās* in *shaḍaśīti saṅkramaṇas* and sixteen *ghaṭikās* in *Vishṇupadī saṅkramaṇas* are very sacred. These durations have been specified with the intention that ordinary people should not transgress them.

> तद्योगादप्यधश्चोर्ध्वं त्रिंशन्नाड्यः पवित्रिताः। \(देवल\)  
> षडशीत्यामतीतायां षष्टिरुक्तास्तु नाडिकाः।  
> पुण्यायां विष्णुपद्यां च प्राक् पश्चादपि षोडश॥ \(वृद्धवासिष्ठ\) 

This is the ordinary *puṇyakāla*. Then which is the most meritorious time? The times ie. 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 or 12 *ghaṭikā*s nearest to the occurrence of the *puṇyakāla* respectively, are most auspicious.

> त्रिचतुः पासप्ताष्ट नव द्वादश एव च ।  
> क्रमेण घटिका ह्येतास्तत्पुण्यं पारमार्थिकम् ॥ \(देवीपुराण\) 

And to the question—“How long the meritorious time prevails during *saṅkramaṇa”*, we see an ordinary answer in scriptures as, “the time duration which is sixteen or fifteen *ghaṭikās* just before the *saṅkrama”*.

> अर्वाक् षोडश विज्ञेया नाड्यः पश्चाच्च षोडश ।  
> कालः पुण्योर्कसङ्क्रान्ते विद्वद्भिः परिकीर्तितः॥ \(शातातप\) 

> सङ्क्रान्तौ पुण्यकालस्तु षोडशोभयतः कलाः॥ \(मरीचि\) 

> अतीतानागतो भोगो नाड्यः पञ्चदश स्मृताः॥ \(देवीपुराण\) 

After a study of all the rules regarding the duration of *puṇyakāla*, a treatise by name *Dharmasindhu* states the conclusion as follows:-

On the *puṇya dinas* of *Vishu*, ie. During *Mesha* and *Tula saṅkramaṇas*, the *puṇyakāla* will be for a duration of 15 *ghaṭikas* before and after the occurrence of the *puṇyakālas*, 16 *ghaṭikās* preceding the *Vṛshabha, simha, vṛścika* and *kumbha saṅkramaṇas*, 16 *ghaṭikās* succeeding the *mithuna, kanyā, dhanus* and *mīna saṅkramaṇas*, 30 *ghaṭikās* preceding the *karkātaka saṅkramaṇa* \(*dakshiṇāyana puṇyakāla*\), and 40 *ghaṭikās* succeeding the *Makara saṅkramaṇa \(uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla\);* the preceding and the succeeding 30 *ghaṭikās* in all the *saṅkramaṇas*, the succeeding sixty *ghaṭikās* in the *shaḍaśīti puṇyakāla* and, the preceding and succeeding sixteen *ghaṭikās* in *Vishṇupadīpuṇyakāla*.

Even though the determination of the time of only the *Makara Saṅkrānti* is relevant to this article, we have narrated the matter pertaining to other *Saṅkrāntis* also, as we feel that it is necessary at this juncture.

Regarding the time of observation of rituals during *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla \(Makara Saṅkrānti\)* and *dakshiṇāyana puṇyakāla \(karkātaka Saṅkrānti\)*, the following rule is followed in South India. Rituals can be observed till a period of 20 *ghaṭikā*s from the birth of *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla* and in the duration of 20 *ghaṭikā*s preceding the birth of *dakshiṇāyanapuṇyakāla*. Any way, in both the cases the rituals are performed in *uttarāyaṇa* only; “अयने विंशतिः पूर्वं अयने विंशतिः परम् ”

The duration of the *puṇyakālas* should be understood as follows: If *Saṅkrānti* sets in during day time at 2 *ghaṭikā*s to sunset or before, the *puṇyakāla* will be before *Saṅkrānti* itself, in the *mithuna, kanyā, dhanus* and *mīna saṅkrama*s. If it sets in at two *ghaṭikā*s to sunrise or before that time, then the *puṇyakāla* in the *vṛshabha, vṛścika, kumbha* and *karkātaka saṅkramaṇa*s will be after the *Saṅkrānti*. If *Saṅkrānti* sets in during night hours before midnight, the *puṇyakāla* will be in the latter half of the day time of the previous day. If the *Saṅkrānti* sets in at mid night or later, the *puṇyakāla* extends to both the days \(i.e. the latter half of the previous day and the first half of the next day.\) This rule applies to all *Saṅkrānti*s except *Makara* and *karkātaka Saṅkrānti*s. If *uttarāyaṇa* sets in *Makara māsa* at night, the *puṇyakāla* will be on the first day of *Saṅkrānti* and if *karkātaka Saṅkrānti* sets in the night, the *puṇyakāla* will be on the previous day. If *Makara Saṅkrānti* sets in at dusk, \(i.e. during three *ghaṭikā*s before sunset\), the *puṇyakāla* will be during the previous day. If *karkātaka Saṅkrānti* sets in at dawn \(i.e. during three *ghaṭikā*s before sunrise\) the *puṇyakāla* will be during the following day.

The time of *puṇyakāla* should be determined as per the above rules, and during that time, holy bath, *japa*, and meditation, *śrāddha* and *tarpaṇa* should be performed.

As it is possible only for *yogis* to know the exact time of the *saṅkramaṇas*, the above said directions are given by the scriptures with regard to the performance of rituals, keeping in mind the ordinary people. **We humbly remember here that *ŚrīGurudeva* who was a supreme *yogi*, and a supreme preceptor of the science of *nādi*, had demonstrated** by experimental science to a few intimate disciples of his, that the exact and most infinitesimal time of the setting in of *saṅkramaṇa* and the exact extent of its duration can be known not only by *yoga dhyana* but also by the practice of *nāḍī vijnāna* taught by *yogis*.

Here we would like to briefly describe the modalities of the observation of the festival.

1\) *Śāstra*s state that as *Saṅkrānti*s, like eclipses, are considered very great *puṇyakāla*s, it is highly meritorious to take a bath in the holy *tīrthās*. By this, all are benfitted with *puṇya* and *purushārthas*. Not only this. If one does not take a bath at that time, he will be struck with adversities also. And diseases and misfortunes arrive. The *Purāṇās* proclaim—“If one takes a bath in the holy *Gaṅgā* on that day, he will attain *Brahmaloka*. If he does not take a holy bath, he will be afflicted with diseases for seven lives \(to come\)” and also will be afflicted with penury.

> गङ्गास्नातो नरः कामात् ब्रह्मणः सदनं व्रजेत्  
> रविसङ्क्रमणे पुण्ये न स्नायाद्यस्तु मानवः ।  
> सप्तजन्मन्यसौ रोगी निर्धनश्चोपजायते”॥ 

It should be remembered here that this is not merely a *Malāpakarshaṇa snāna* that washes off the dirt of the body, but a *puṇyasnāna* which washes off blemishes of the mind also. So, it is more meritorious to have *abhyaṅgana* with cold water instead of hot water. Only persons who are weak should take bath in hot water. Those who can afford to go to the *puṇyatīrthas* like *Gaṅgā* etc., take a bath with a *saṅkalpa*.

2\) After the holy bath, those who are *adhikāris* for performing *śrāddha* should perform it with *tarpaṇa*, and should do *dānas*. It is a very auspicious time for meditation of God, as Mother Nature naturally turns the mind inwards at that time. It is also an excellent time for performimg *mantra, japa, pūjā* and *pārāyaṇa* which foster meditation. It is also a very good time for receiving *Dhyānadīkshā* and *Mantradīkshā*.

3\) On the day of this festival known as *‘Eḷḷina habba’*, only sesame seeds are used in several forms. Bathing is done with sesame. Sesame is used for *tarpaṇa*. An image of a cow made of sesame seeds may be gifted. *Dāna* of only sesame seeds, or sesame seeds mixed with condiments like jaggery, dry cococnut, groundnuts etc is done. To ward off evil spirits, sesame seeds are showered on babies. The practice of showering jujube fruits on children is also there. *Ārati* is performed to children and blessings from teachers and elders are obtained after offering salutations to them.

4\) Worship of God is specially done and *prasāda* is taken.—A dish by name *‘Huggi’* which is made with rice and green gram \(also called *pongal*\), happens to be a prominent one among the items offered to God and taken as *prasāda*. The inaugural *naivedya* is done with this item, which is offered to God as *naivedya* on all the days of *Dhanurmāsa*, which is the month previous to that.

5\) This festival is celebrated with a lot of bustle and excitement and enthusiasm in Tamilnadu. The word *pongal* means overflowing. The auspicious custom of boiling milk in a utensil on an oven that is cleaned with water and smeared with cow dung and making it to over flow, is specially observed.

6\) Cows are specially worshipped on that day. They are bathed and their horns are painted and decorated. They are fed with enjoyable fodder of grass, cereals, coconuts and jaggery which are dear to them, good to them and which are full of juice. They are made to leap \(jump\) through burning fire to ward off evils. This is called *‘kiccu hāyisuvudu’* \(leaping through a blaze\).

7\) There is a custom of distributing sesame seeds mixed with condiments, pieces of sugar cane and images made of sugar. People speak \(sweetly\) with their dear ones and friends. To remind all those who receive sesame seeds and jaggery that they must speak only sweet words, the Kannada proverb *“Eḷḷubellava tindu oḷḷemātanāḍu”*. is quoted. There are proverbs in Hindi and Marathi languages also carrying a similar meaning.

8\) Not only the day of *Saṅkrānti* but the previous day and the day next to it are also celebrated as connected festival days. The preceding day is called *“Bhogiya habba”* \(*Saṅkrānti* is a festival dear to both *yogis* and *bhogis*.\) The day next to *Saṅkrānti* is famous by the name *‘kanūhabba’*. People who follow the tradition of the Tamil country specially celebrate it. It is women who observe the custom of *Kanū* festival. This is a special custom followed to please the *bhūtas*. In this festival, the leftover food items viz *bhakshya, Bhojya, coshya* and *lehya* that were offered to God as *neivedya* on the day of *Saṅkrānti*, are taken and mixed with handfuls of multicoloured prepartions such as red and yellow rice made from left over rice and pieces of fruits, sugar cane etc, are placed on leaves outside homes, and are offered to *Bhūtas*. These are offered before bath in the morning and then a bath is taken. The practice of offering it after bath is also there. The custom of women getting together in gardens and parks on that afternoon or evening, and sharing with each other the food prepared in each of their homes and partaking is also there. The custom of women uttering strange wishes and words such as ‘Marriage of the crows, *Sīmanta* to the sparrows’ etc., while placing the *kanū* rice *balis* is in vogue.

9\) Though the *uttarāyaṇa* that begins on *Makara Saṅkrānti* is dear to *devatās* and is auspicious for sacred functions such as *upanayana, cūḍākarma* etc, they should not be celebrated on the day of *Makara Saṅkrānti*. It is a special auspicious time only for *Dhyāna, dāna, japa* etc.

10\) There is a custom of honouring astrologers on that night after *devatāpūjā* and listening to them after they are requested to read out the *Svarūpa* of *Saṅkrāntimūrtī* and the outcome of the effect of *Saṅkrānti* of that year. Then the astrologer worships the almanac and describes the *mūrti* of *Saṅkrānti* as having three heads, two faces, five mouths, three eyes, dangling ear lobes and eye-brows, red teeth, long nose, eight arms, two legs, ugly shape, dark complexion, body of half man and half woman. Then he interprets the effects brought out by the special name of *Saṅkrānti*, of the following:- the week of arrival of *Saṅkrānti*, the fortnight, the *tithi*, the star, the *Yoga* and *Karaṇa*, the gaze of *Saṅkrānti*, the direction of its journey, it’s time \(duration\), the benefit of taking the holy bath, clothes, applying unguents, flower, decoration, food, carriage, weapon, seat, birth, direction, the state of the age etc.

11\) As *Saṅkrānti* is best for *pitṛupūja*, persons who perform *tarpaṇa* etc should eat only once \(and fast in the other part of the day\). It is best for others also to take light food at night and spend more time in meditation and worship of God.

We will now critically analyse a well known problem related to the significance of *uttarāyaṇa*, and discuss the modalities of the observance of the festival.

### The problem of *uttarāyaṇa*

*Ayana* means a path. “अयनं वत्र्ममर्गाध्वपन्थानः पदवी सृतिः ” *uttarāyaṇa* means the way towards the north. The special time during which the Sun appears to be travelling in the path of the northern direction is called *‘uttarāyaṇa’* technically. This time starts when the Sun enters the *Makararāśi* and continues till the time he enters into *karkaṭa rāśi*. Similarly the special time in the Sun’s journey from the *karkaṭa rāśi* to his entry into *Makara rāśi* is called *‘dakshiṇāyana’*.

> उत्तरायणमप्युक्तं मकरस्थे दिवाकरे ।  
> कर्कटादिस्थिते भानौ दक्षिणायनमुच्यते ॥ 

The word *uttara* also means the best \(supreme\). Therefore *uttarāyaṇa* means the best path and, the time during which the sun travels in that path also becomes *‘uttarāyaṇa’*. Both these meanings i.e. the time during which the sun travels in the northern direction and the best time, agree in sense for the term *‘uttarāyaṇa’*. The first meaning is visible to the eye. The second one is a matter that has to be known from scriptures and by experience. This indeed is the issue which is posing a problem here.

What is special about the supremacy in the duration of time of *uttarāyaṇa*? It is referred to as ‘the day of the *devatās’* and the best time for the performance of *‘vedavrata’*, marriage, *cūdākarma, upanayana* etc, which are dear to the *devatās*. Opposed to this the *‘dakshiṇāyana’* which is called the night of the *devatās* is best for *tarpaṇa, śrāddha* etc. which are dear to *pitṛ devatās*.

> दैवे रात्र्यहनी वर्षं प्रविभागस्तयोः पुनः ।  
> अहस्तत्रोदगयनं रात्रिः स्याद्दक्षिणायनम् ॥ 

Ths *śāstras* are of the opinion that *uttarāyaṇa* is best for *devatā kāryas* like *dhyāna, dāna*, worship, *mantropadeśa* etc. There is not much of an objection to this. But another well known thing about *uttarāyaṇa* has lead to discussions and criticisms. What is that well known thing? It is the assertion by the scriptures that those who pass away in *uttarāyaṇa* attain *moksha*. This assertion has indeed created a confusion. We come across statements in scriptures, which say that people who pass away in *Kāśī* attain *moksha* and also that people who pass away in *uttarāyaṇa* attain salvation. We see an opinion in the *Mahābhārata* that the great yogi *Bhīshma*, who was felled to a bed of arrows at the time of *dakshiṇāyana*, held on to his *prāṇa* till the time of the arrival of *uttarāyaṇa*, for the above said reason only.

“धारयिष्याम्यहं प्राणान्पतितोऽपि महीतले उत्तरायणमन्विच्छन् सुगतिप्रतिकाङ्क्षया” । 

\(The words of *Bhīshma*-“Though I have fallen on the ground, I am waiting for the arrival of *uttarāyaṇa*, as I am desirous of *Sadgati*. I will hold on to my *prāṇās* till then”\). It is the clear opinion of the *upanishats* that there is no salvation for a person who leaves his body in *dakshiṇāyana*. He travels in the path of *pitṛs* and is merged in *candra*. Whoever attains *candra* will be born again.

> अथ यो दक्षिणे प्रमीयते, पितृणामेव महिमानं गत्वा  
चन्द्रमसस्सायुज्यं गच्छति \(तै. उ. \) 

> तेषां यदा तत्पर्यवैति अथैतमेवाध्वानं पुनर्निवर्तन्ते \(छां. उ\) 

The *Upaniśats* clearly declare that the need of *uttarāyaṇa* is there for a *yogi* who desires a place in the *Brahma sthāna* which is free from rebirths.

> अपूर्यमाणपक्षाद्यान् षडुदङ्ङेति मासांस्तान् ॥ \(छां. 4-115-5\) 

In the *Bhagavad-Gīta* which is the essence of *upaniśats*, there is a teaching.—“Listen to me. I will tell you the time, when departing, the *yogis* attain salvation which is free from rebirth and also the time, when departing, they are subject to rebirth. *Yogis* who are *Brahmavids* who travel through *agni, jyoti*, day, bright fortnight and during the six months of *uttarāyaṇa* will attain the *Brahma*, and the *yogis* who travel through smoke, night, dark fortnight and the six months of *dakshiṇāyana* will reach the light of *candra*, return to *samsāra* again.”

> यत्र कालेत्वनावृत्तिं आवृत्तिं चैव योगिनः ।  
प्रयाता यान्ति तं कालं वक्ष्यामि भरतर्षभ ॥ 

> अग्निर्जोयितरहश्शुक्लः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम् ।  
तत्र प्रयाता गच्छन्ति ब्रह्म ब्रह्मविदो जनाः॥ 

> धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षण्मासा दक्षिणायनम् ।  
> तत्र चान्द्रमसं ज्योतिः योगी प्राप्य निवर्तते ॥ 

The path of *uttarāyaṇa* is also called *“Archirādimārga”*, because it begins with the *darśana* of *‘Agnijyoti’*. As it delivers to the abode of *paramātman* the of God of Gods, from which there is no return, it is also called as *‘Devayāna mārga*.’ Likewise, we see that there are two names for the path of *dakshiṇāyana* viz *‘dhūmādi mārga’* and *‘pitṛyāna mārga’.* Among these, the *devayāna mārga* transports one to *mukti*. The second one makes a person to return to *samsāra*, the *upaniśats* clarify further.

“ते य एवमेतद्विदुः ये चापी अरण्ये श्रद्धां सत्यमुपासते तेऽर्चिरभिसम्भवन्ति, अर्चिषोऽहः अह्न आपूर्यमाणपक्षं, आपूर्यमाणपक्षाद्यान् षण्मासान् उदङ्ङादित्य एति मासेभ्यो देवलोकम्, देवलोकादादित्यं आदित्याद्वैद्युतम्, तान्वैद्युतान् पुरुषो मानस एत्य ब्रह्मलोकान्गमयति, तेषु ब्रह्मलोकेषु पराः परावतो वसन्ति तेषां न पुनरावृत्तिः।

		
अथ ये यज्ञेन दानेन तपसा लोकान् जयन्ति ते धूममभिसम्भवन्ति. धूमाद्रात्रिं, रात्रेरपक्षीयमाणपक्षं अपक्षीयमाणपक्षाद्यान् षण्मासान् दक्षिणामादित्य एति, मासेभ्यः पितृलोकम्, पितृलोकाच्चन्द्रम्, ते चन्द्रं प्राप्य अन्नं भवन्ति ताग्ं स्तत्रदेवा यथा सोमं राजानमाप्यायस्वापक्षीयस्वेति” बृहदारण्यक 6-1-14-15

On the whole, it has been clearly proclaimed in the *upanishats, Gīta* and *Itihāsas* that those who give up their *prāṇās* in the path of *uttarāyaṇa* \(time\) will attain salvation and those who give up their *praṇa* in the *dakshiṇāyana* path are reborn. Then, if a *Brahmajnānī* dies accidentally in *dakshiṇāyana*, does he return *samsāra*? And, if an *ajnāni* accidentally dies in *uttarāyaṇa* will he get *mukti*? If one kills an *ajnāni* in *uttarāyaṇa*, will it help him to obtain *mukti*? Is it possible to avert the *mukti* of a *Brahmajnāni* by killing him in *dakshiṇāyana*? What is the relationship between the special times of *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana* and *mukti* or *samsāra*? Is there no place for *jnāna, ajnāna, puṇya*, sin and so on here? These questions invade our minds.

1. Some have given up finding a solution to the problem saying “I do not understand why it has been stated like this in the *Gīta* and the *upanishats*. This is a riddle which I cannot solve”.

2. Regarding this problem the *pūrvācāryas* have presented their conclusions as below after making a study of the above said \(treatises viz\) *Gīta, upaniśats, Itihāsa vākyas* and also *Brahmasūtravākyas* by reasoning, which conform to the *śāstra*s, as follows.:

\(*Brahmasūtra* ch. 4 *sūtra* 507, 508, 512 “अतश्चायनेऽपि दक्षिणे” “योगिनः प्रतिस्मर्येते स्मार्ते चैते” “अतिवाहिकास्तल्लिङ्गात्”\)

We can summarize their conclusions thus: There are two types of people who attain *mukti* viz. those who attain *mukti* immediately and those who attain salvation progressively There is neither *Gati* nor *Agati* for those great souls who belong to the first category who are *pūrṇabrahmajnānis* and have *samyagdarśananishṭhā*. Their *prāṇās* have already merged in *brahma* and they have become *Brahmamayas* and *Brahmabhūtas*. *“Na tasya prāṇā utkramanti”* They have either *arcirādigati* or *Dhoomādigati*. Regarding them, the *śāstras* make no mention of the *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana gatis.*

The *uttarāyaṇa* path is for the *Brahmopāsaka yogis* who attain progressive emancipation. They attain *mukti* in the course of time. They tavel through the path viz the *devatā* of day time who is the presiding deity of time, *śuklapakshadevatā* and *uttarāyaṇa devatā*, and attain *Brahman*. *Yogis* who have followed the path of *karma*, travel by the route viz *Dhūmābhimānidevatā, Rātryabhimānidevatā, Kṛshṇapakshadevatā* and *dakshiṇāyana devatā*, and reach the *Candrajyoti*, and with the waning of their *puṇya*, return to the world again.

The renown that death in *uttarāyaṇa* is auspicious, applies only to persons who are not *jnānis*. Though *Bhīshma* was a *jnāni* he kept waiting for arrival of *uttarāyaṇa*. It was in the interest of protecting the *Śishṭacāra* and also to demonstrate to the world the \(power of\) the boon of *svecchāmaraṇa* granted by his father. The *Kālaviniyoga* stated in the *smṛti* \(the *Gīta*\) as *Anāvṛttiphala* is with reference to *Yogis*. These *Yogasānkhyas* are only *smṛtis* and not *śruti siddhas*. This division of time stated in the *smṛtis* does not apply to the *upāsanas* related to the Vedas. Or, there will be no contradiction if the words of the *Smṛtis* also are understood to mean that agni and others are *Ātivāikadevatā*s, as stated the *Vedas*.

“प्रकृतानां योगिनां प्रणवावेशितब्रह्मबुद्धीनां कालान्तरमुकिभाजां ब्रह्मप्रतिपत्तये उत्तरो मार्गो वक्तव्य इति यत्र काले इत्यादि । योगिनः इति योगिनः कर्मिणश्च उच्यन्ते अग्निः कलाभिमानिनीदेवता, तथा अहर्देवता अहरभिमानिनी ब्रह्मविदः ब्रह्मोपासनपरा जनाः क्रमेण इति वाक्यशेषः न हि सद्योमुकिभाजां सम्यग्दर्शननिष्ठानां गतिरगतिर्वा क्वचिदस्ति न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति इति श्रुतेः ब्रह्मसंलीनप्राणा एव ते। ब्रह्ममया ब्रह्मभूता एव ते, प्राशस्त्य प्रसिद्धिः अविद्वद्विषया भीष्मस्य प्रतिपालनं आचारप्रतिपालनार्थं पितृप्रसादलब्ध स्वच्छन्द मृत्युताख्यापनार्थं च। श्रुतेस्त्वर्थं वक्ष्यति अतिवाहिकास्तल्लिङ्गात् इत्यत्र योगिनः प्रति चायं अहरादिकालविनियोगः अनावृत्तये स्मर्यते, स्मार्ते चैते योगसाङ्ख्ये न श्रौते, अतो विषयभेदात् प्रमाणविशेषाच्च नास्य स्मार्तस्य काल विनियोगस्य श्रौतेषु विज्ञानेष्ववतारः - यदा पुनः स्मृतावपि अग्न्याद्याः देवता एवातिवाहिक्यो गृह्यन्ते तदा न कश्चित् विरोध इति।’ \(श्रीशङ्करभाष्य\)

The ones who have realized the *Ātmayāthātmya* and the ones who are *paramapurushanishṭhas* travel in the path of *‘arcirādigati’*. They do not have to return to the worldly life. They attain *mukti*. The world *kāla* indicates the path. It means, “in the path filled with *kalābhimāni devatās”*. So it is the *uttarāyaṇamārga* and *dakshiṇāyanamārga* that have been stated hereby. The one that is stated for the *yogis* is the *arcirādimārga*, the *devayāna mārga*. And for the *puṇyakarmis* it is the *‘punarāvṛtti mārga’* and the *pitṛyāna mārga*. For \(*jnāni*s\) and *puṇyakarmis* it is *śukla arcirādi, anāvṛtti mārga* and *Kṛshṇa* \(*Dhūmādi, Āvṛtti*\) *mārga*s respectively. A *Yogi* must have the knowledge of both the paths during travel. Awareness of this will free him from delusion. He travels only in his *Devayāna mārga* and attains *mukti*.

A *brahmajnāni* is assured of *moksha* even if he dies in *dakshiṇāyana*. Only those who are not *jnāni*s, travel by the *pitṛuyāna mārga*, reach *candra* and return to *samsāra*. Even if *jnāni*s reach *candra*, it will be only a resting place for them. From there they attain *Parabrahma* only, from which there is no return. Only persons like *Bhīshma* and others had the *svacchanda maraṇa śakti* by the power of *yoga*. They \(*Bhīshma* in particular\) just waited for the *uttarāyaṇakāla*, only to pioneer Dharma and to demonstrate the importance of *uttarāyaṇa*.

No mention has been made here with regard to people who are nearing death, about the distinct time in which they should die. It is only stated that *Yoganishṭhas* should remember these *devayāna* and *pitṛyāna paths*. As a part of *yoga* they should remember these two paths. By doing so, they will be freed from *moha*.

In “यत्र काले त्वनावृत्तिम् ” etc, the word *‘kāla’* refers to *ativāhaka devatās* who are *kāladyabhimānis*. *Agni* and others are not *kāla*, but are *devatās*. What has been said here clearly is about the remembrance of *devayāna* and not the distinct time of death.

“अविदुषाम्” पितृयानेन पथा चन्द्रं प्राप्तानामेव पुनरावृत्तिः, विदुषस्तु चन्द्रं प्राप्तस्यापि तस्माद्ब्रह्मणो महिमानमाप्नोतीति वाक्यशेषात् तस्य दक्षिणायनमृतस्य चन्द्रप्राप्तिः ब्रह्मप्रपित्सतः विश्रामहेतुमात्रमिति गम्यते। भीष्मादीनां योगप्रभावात् स्वच्छन्दमरणानां धर्मप्रवर्तनाय उत्तरायणप्राशस्त्यप्रदर्शनार्थस्तथा विचारः ।

3.Though it is stated that those who die in *dakshiṇāyana*, reach heaven and those who die in *uttarāyaṇa* obtain *parabrahma*, it is also proper for *jnāni*s to pass away in *dakshiṇāyana*.

“दक्षिणे मरणाद्याति स्वर्गं ब्रह्मोत्तरायणे” - इति उक्तेः ज्ञानिनः” दक्षिणायनोत्क्रान्तिः युज्यते”

Both these *Gatis* with regard to *yogis* are mentioned in the *smṛtis*. These depend on remembrance. *Brahma* and *candra gatis* are not merely in the hands of *Kāla*. They are different as per the division, as *Jnānyogis* and *Karmayogis*.

“न केवलं कालादिकृते ब्रह्मचन्द्रगती स्मर्येते किन्तु ज्ञानयोगिनःकर्मयोगिनश्च. . . . ”

It is said here that those who have \(attained\) the *abhimāna devatās* such as *kāla* and others, attain *āvṛtti* and *anaṛvrtti*; *Agni* and others are the *abhimāni devatās*.

“यत्कालाद्यभिमानिदेवता गताः आवृत्त्यनावृत्ती गच्छन्ति ता आह अभिमानिदेवताश्च अग्न्यादयः” \(श्रीमध्वभाष्य\)

4. “The word *‘Yatra’* indicates the \(path\) of the *yogis”*. It also indicates the meaning—“I will tell you of the path and also the *kāla”* \(*Śrī Vāmanaṭīkā*\).

5. Such of those *brahmajnānis* who have attained *Brahmabhāva* in this world itself, do not have much to benefit from the path of *uttarāyaṇa*. And *Punarāvṛtti* is certain for *Karmayogis*. There is nothing special from *dakshiṇāyana* for them. That is why they are referred to as *‘yogis’*.

Even if a *Brahmajnāni* happens to die in *dakshiṇāyana* itself, he can attain *Brahmaloka*, and an example for this is found in *Mahābhārata* itself. It is described that *Droṇācārya* who gave up his body by *yogadharma* in the battle field on the fifth day from the fall of *Bhīshma*, attained *brahmaloka*.

> द्रोणोऽपि शस्त्राण्युत्सृज्य परमं साङ्ख्यमास्थितः ।  
> दिवमाक्रमदाचार्यः साक्षात्सद्भिर्दुराक्रमम् ।  
> ब्रह्मलोकं महद्दिव्यं देवगुह्यं हि तत्परम्” \(अविगीता\) 

Here we have briefly quoted some attempts made by the ancient *acāryas* to solve the issue related to the attainment of *mukti* with regard to people passing away in *uttarāyaṇa*, and the *Punarāvṛtti* of people passing away in *dakshiṇāyana*. It is very clearly stated in *Gīta* and *Upaniśads* that those who die in *uttarāyaṇa* attain salvation, and those who die in *dakshiṇāyana* will be subjected to *Punarāvṛtti*. The *Ācāryas* have with effort propounded that *Brahmajnāni*s have no hindrance to *mukti* even if they happen to die in *dakshiṇāyana*, and no matter whatever be the time they give up their body, they attain *moksha* only. *Brahmasūtras* also arrive at this very opinion that even if he happens to pass away in *dakshiṇāyana*, he attains *moksha* only. *Mahābhārata* cites the examples of great *yogis Droṇacārya, Bhūriśravas* and others that even though they gave up their bodies during the time called *dakshiṇāyana* they attained *mukti* only. But *Gīta* and *Upaniśads* clearly state that *mukti* is attained if the mortal coil is cast off in *Uttarāyaṇa* and it will be *Purarāvṛtti* if death happens in *dakshiṇāyana*. Nothing has been stated distinctly for *jnāni*s and *ajnāni*s there, in this regard. We have not come across any explanation in the previous commentaries about the relationship between *uttarāyaṇa* and *mukti*, and the relationship between *dakshiṇāyana* and *Punarāvṛtti*.

		
Some scholars have tried to solve the problem by interpreting the word *‘kāla’* to mean *‘mārga’* Some others have tried to resolve the problem trying to interpret that the above said *kālaniyama* applies only to the worshippers and not to *jnānis* who are directly eligible for *mukti*. We offer our gratitude to these *Bhāshyakāras* and commentators hereby, and shall quote below the solution we obtained from **the divine explanation provided by *Śrī Raṅgagurudeva*, when we were in search of a clear solution to this problem which conforms to scriptures, reason and experience**.

To our question, “does an *ajnāni* attain salvation if he dies in *uttarāyaṇa*,” he answered that there is no *dehatyāga* in the case of an ‘a*jnāni’* in *uttarāyaṇa*. To the question, “does a *jnāni* gets subjected to *Purnarāvṛtti* if he dies in *dakshiṇāyana”*, he replied that there is no question of the happening of *dehatyāga* at all in the case of a *jnāni* in *dakshiṇāyana*. Then we rained many more questions. “This explanation is in contradiction to reason and illustrations indeed\! If a *jnāni* dies in *dakshiṇāyana* where does his divine knowledge go? How does the ignorance of an a*jnāni* vanish if he dies in *uttarāyaṇa*? How can the light of divine knowledge occur to him all of a sudden, and take him to *mukti*? The example of *Droṇacārya* attaining *mukti* by his power of *yoga* even though he died in *dakshiṇāyana* topples the conclusions regarding the significance of the times of *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*\! Then why did *Bhīshmacārya*, inspite of being a *jnāni* desired for *uttarāyaṇa* to cast off the mortal coil?” To this, *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* serenely bestowed answers which provided us great satisfaction. He answered our subsequent questions as below:

“The distinct times of *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*, as seen outside, exist inside \(the human body\) also. *Uttarāyaṇa* will lead to salvation, whereas *dakshiṇāyana* pushes down to *Punarāvṛtti*. Even though a *jnāni* casts off his mortal coil in *dakshiṇāyana*, he creates *uttarāyaṇa* itself within, by the power of *yoga*. By that he will anyhow attain *mukti*. Even though an ‘a*jnāni’* gives up his body in *uttarāyaṇa*, the time within him will be *dakshiṇāyana* only. As he does not have the capability to convert the time into *uttarāyaṇa* within, he will return to the worldly life \(again\). Sometimes, the external *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana* may conjoin with the inner *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*, and may remain separate also. Even though it was *dakshiṇāyana* outside, at the time of the giving up of his body by *Droṇacārya*, he created the condition of *uttarāyaṇa* within, by the power of yoga. Therefore he attained *mukti*. Contrary to this, a*jnāni*s who die when it is *uttarāyaṇa* outside, are subject to *Punarāvṛtti* as it will be *dakshiṇāyana* inside them. How at all can one have the capacity to create the condition of *uttarāyaṇa* inside, if he is not endowed with *yoga, Samādhi* and *Brahmjana*, which are possible only with the grace of God\!”?

To the question ‘what proof is there to show that there are *tithi, vāra, paksha* and *ayana* inside also,’ he gave a direct answer “The experience of a *yogi* is the proof. When the mind is pure, it can be clearly seen by the inner eye”. We found the substantiation to this in the *Purāṇās* also. According to *yogaśāstra*, *“uttarāyaṇa”* is the time when *‘prāṇa’* enters the *Idā nādi* which is on the left side of the body from the *piṅgala nāḍi* which is on the right side of the body and travels there. Entering the *Iḍa nāḍi* like this, it joins the middle *nādi* called *sushumnā*. *Mukti* and immortality are certain for a person who gives up his \(*prāṇa*\) through the *sushumnā nāḍi*. “तासां मूर्धानमभिनिस्सृतैका. तयोध्र्वमायन् अमृतत्वमेति” declares the *kaṭha śruti. Dakshiṇāyana* means the time when *prāna* enters from the *Iḍānāḍi* which is on the left side into the *piṅgala nādi* which is on the right side and travels there. Thus, it is certain that it is *archirādi gati* for those, who in this way come to *uttarāyaṇa* which is endowed with a special snese, and, for those who come in the *dakshiṇāyana*, it is *dhūmādigati* and *punarāvṛtti*. When *Droṇacārya* gave up his body it was *dakshiṇāyana* outside. But by the power of *yoga*, he entered the *pingalā nāḍi* from the *Iḍā nāḍi* and entered the *sushumnā nādi* and so became a traveller in the *arcirādi* path and thus attained *mukti*. When *ajnāni*s give up the body, their prana will be travelling in the *piṅgaḷā nādi* only, and so they attain *dhūmādigati* only, though it is *uttarāyaṇa* outside.

> पिङ्गलाया इडायां तु वायोः सङ्क्रमणं हि यत् ।  
> तदुत्तरायणं प्रोक्तं मुने वेदान्तवेदिभिः ।  
> इडायाः पिङ्गालायां तु प्राणसङ्क्रमणं मुने ।  
> दक्षिणायनमित्युक्तं पिङ्गलायामिति श्रुतम् ।  
\(सूतसंहिता, ज्ञानकाण्ड, अध्याय 11\) 

Thus, by discerning the true spiritual meaning of the words *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*, it becomes clear that it is *uttarāyaṇagati* for the *jnāni* and the *dakshiṇāyanagati* for the *ajnāni*, irrespective of the *ayana* outside.

**Then, we placed before *ŚrīGurudeva* a question “The *Upanishads* state” - his *prāṇās* never depart. There is no gati for him at all.** “न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति”. He has become one with Brahman and has become Brahman himself. With reference to whom is this description?” To this he said-

“It refers to the person who is in *samādhi* i.e. being in the state of *Brāhmi Sthiti*. When the casting off of the body happens in that state, there is no question of travelling at all. There is not even the path of *uttarāyaṇa*. Because, he is already established in *Brahma* which is the goal of *uttarāyaṇa gati*.”

Question: If *Dehatyāga* occurs for a *jnāni* when he is in a state of other than that *Samādhi*, what will happen \(to him\)?

Answer: Then also he will be quickly travelling in the path of *uttarāyaṇa*, and enters the *sushumnā nādi* and becomes one with *Brahma.* For example, the owner of the house who is familiar with it knows where the *pūja* room is by habit. Even if darkness envelops the house, he will reach the *pūja* room quickly by force of habit. Light will be there always. Similarly, a *yogi* who is familiar with *ātma*, travels quickly in the path of *uttarāyaṇa* and obtains the state of *Brahman*. Whereas, *ajnānis* who will be familiar only with the rooms of *karma*, will neither know the path to the *pūja* room nor can they enter it.

Question : There is no doubt that *Bhīshmacārya* was a supreme *jnāni*. When he fell into the bed of arrows it was *dakshiṇāyana* outside. Why did he not obtain *sadgati* by accomplishing *uttarāyaṇa* inside immediately by the power of his *yoga*?

Answer: There is no doubt that he had that power of *yoga*. Even then, due to some special reasons he waited for the *uttarāyaṇa*, to cast off his mortal coil.

Question : What are those special reasons?

Answer: *Bhīshma* had a mandate from God to remain alive for six more months and to complete the divine task of teaching some supreme dharmas to *Dharmarāja* and to grace the world. So, without giving up his body during \(the external\) *dakshiṇāyana* he retained the body for some time.

\(2\) His father had granted him the boon to cast off his mortal coil at will. The great man had preserved the power of that boon for a \(noble\) purpose.

\(3\) The period \(of six months starting from *makara Saṅkrānti*\) called external *uttarāyaṇa* by the scriptures, is also very auspicious. *Uttarāyaṇa* also means excellent path. As per the *saṅkalpa* of God, during that period, nature will also be conducive to do meditation on God, and for *Japa, Tapas, Upanayana, Vrata* and such other auspicious *devatākāryas*. It is also called the day time of the *devatā*s, as it is a convenient time to travel in the *devayāna* with the help of the *devatā*s. The facility provided by nature should be made use of by the *Sādhakās*. As the proverb *‘Gāḷi Bandāga Tūriko’* \(‘Winnow the husk when the wind blows’\) states, one should utilize the favourable time provided by Mother nature for good things, without wasting it. This is the way of wisdom, good traditions and virtuous practices. Having followed all this, and in order to show the *Sadācāra* and *Satsampradāya, Bhīshma* the *Mahātma* did not give up his body in the the external *dakshiṇāyana* but waited till the arrival of external *uttarāyaṇa*, and merging his inner *uttarāyaṇa* with the \(external\) *uttarāyaṇa*, he attained the holy feet of *paramātma*. One should not forget that *Bhīshma* was both a *Brahmishṭha* and *Dharmishṭha*. The ancient *ācāryas* also have made this observation of reason, in their commentaries and expositions.

*Upanishads* and *Bhagavad-Gīta* are \(supreme\) works of spiritual science. The *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*s mentioned there are \(the spiritual *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana*s. **We remember here our revered supreme *Gurudeva* with gratitude who explained the chapter of *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana* conforming to the abovesaid \(scriptures\)** and conforming to the experience of *Brahmajnāni*s and making a *tattvasamanvaya* as purported in *“Sarveshāmavirodhena”*, and provided satisfaction to the thoughtful mind.

Question: You have elucidated that even when it is *uttarāyaṇa* outside, it is *dakshiṇāyana* only within for some, and even though it is *dakshiṇāyana* outside, it is *uttarāyaṇa* within for some others. Is it possible that two dissimilar states can exist i.e. the state of one *ayana* within, and the state of an *ayana* exactly opposite to that outside?

Answer: That it is possible is a matter of inner experience. For example when *Droṇacārya* left his body, it was *dakshiṇāyana* outside. But it has been already told that, by the power of *yoga* he created *uttarāyaṇa* within, and through the *Devayāna mārga* he reached *paramātma*.

Question: Ordinary people cannot comprehend the experiences of such *yogis*. Can you kindly enlighten us as to how can a certain season in the outside world, and a season opposite of it in the inner world be possible, by citing examples in every day life?

Answer: It can be explained clearly. Let us say it is an evening time in spring season. So, surroundings will be cool and pleasant with cool air around. But if the fire of lust and anger is burning inside the mind of a person at that time it will be a flaming hot summer season only from the point of view of his inner nature. But even if it is a flaming hot summer season outside, it can be called a cool evening of the spring from the view point of inner nature, if a person happens to experience peace and happiness with a pleasant mind. As there are seasons in Nature outside, there are seasons for the mind also. These two seasons may merge together and may not also. The poetic expression below, also proclaims this truth.

“There are four seasons in the year.  
There also four seasons in the mind  
The two meet and also meet not.”

We had seen an incident in the life of *Śrīrangamahaguru* which convincingly demonstrated that in the inside world there can be a *kāla* which could be different from the *kāla* outside. Once a respectable person had come to the holy place *Heḍatale* to have a *darśan* of our venerable *guru*. It was a full moon day. *Śrīgurudeva* sent words that he should visit him at 10 AM the next day. That gentleman sent a request to *Śrīraṅgaguru* “I would like to see *Śrīgurudeva* this evening itself. Provide me an opportunity for that. This is an auspicious *Parvakāla*, as today is a full moon day”. We made a request to *Śrīraṅgagurudeva*—**“Today is a full moon day. So he avidly desires to have your *darśan* today itself”. To this, *Śrīraṅgaguru* sent a reply “Today it is a full moon day; tomorrow also it will be a full moon day, for me it is always a full moon day”.** When the gentleman who had come for the *darśan* heard this, he was forthwith thrilled with horripilation. The gentleman, who had the *darśana* of *Śrīraṅgagurudeva* at ten the next morning, experienced the joy of the coolness of full moonlight, on seeing the face of *Śrīraṅgaguru* which was beaming like a full moon, full of natural bliss and peacefulness. Even the words of *Śrīraṅgaguru* were like an ambrosial bath itself. He told us that he had the experience of the coolness of full moon light, even though it was hot outside.

Not only this. We humbly remember here many situations in which people experienced the feeling of an ambrosial bath, on listening to the music of *Śrīraṅgamahāgurudeva* which was full of the experience of the supreme bliss, and which brought to their mind the feel of the spring season, though it was hot outside.

Question: - We are satisfied by the narration of this example and the incidents. Now we wish to ask one more question about the significance of the sacred *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*. You said that *“uttarāyaṇa”* is the day—time of *devatā*s and it is an excellent time for the worship of *devatā*s. But why should the *Pitṛtarpaṇa* be done at the time of *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla* which is the beginning time of *uttarāyaṇa*? Why the worship of *devatā*s is done afterwards? To whom this time is dear? To *Pitṛs* or to *devatā*s? We have a doubt here.

Answer: The *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla* called *‘makaraSaṅkrānti’* is the conjunction time of *dakshiṇāyana* and *uttarāyaṇa*. Therefore it is a commendable time both for the worship of *pitṛs* to whom *dakshiṇāyana* is dear, and for the worship of *devatā*s also to whom *uttarāyaṇa* is dear. So it is dear to both of them. During *puṇyakāla*s the worship of *pitṛs* should be done first and then the worship of *devatā*s performed.

Question: When the whole of *uttarāyaṇa* itself is a *puṇyakāla*, why should the exceptional time that arrives on the day of *makara Saṅkrānti* be called *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*?

Answer: Though the entire period of *uttarāyaṇa* is meritorious, *makarasaṅkrānti* happens to be its beginning. It is the morning *sandhyākāla* of *uttarāyaṇa*, which is the day of the *devatā*s. Is not the time of *prathahkāla sandhyā* an excellent time for meditation and *Sandhyāvandāna*m for people? When it is so, there is no doubt that the *uttarāyaṇa* which is the time of *praśasta sandhyā* for the *devatā*s, is much more excellent for meditation and *japa*.

Question: Which is more important between *pitṛ kārya* and *devakārya*?

Answer: - Both are equally important. But as *pitṛs* are in the place of *pitṛs* even to *devatās, pitṛpūja* is more important than *devapūja*. *Yajnavarāhasvāmi* proclaims—“देवकार्यात्परतरं पितृकार्यं प्रचक्षते” in the *śānti parva* of *Mahābhārata*. If both the *pitṛ śrāddha* and the festival of worship of *devatās* happen to fall on the same day, only the *śrāddha* is observed. This substantiates the special importance of *pitṛ kārya*.

Question: - As *uttarāyaṇa* is excellent for both i.e. worship of *pitṛ—devatā*s and worship of *devatā*s, can one perform marriage, *upanayana* and other *devatā kāryas* on that day?

Answer: No. Auspicious functions such as marriage, *Upanayana* and *cūḍākarma* etc. should not be performed on that day. It is the day of *saṅkramaṇa*. It is the sacred day when the pull of the *pitṛ devatās* is more. The path of *pitṛs* is opposite to the path of *devatās*. On that day only the *pitṛ mārga* will be open and the inner spiritual centers related only to the *pitṛs* would blossom. Accordinlgy rituals such as *tarpaṇa, dāna* etc. should be performed on that day. As the path and centres related to *devatā*s get closed on that day, auspicious functions should not be performed on that day. Favourable results will not be obtained on that day. But as impulsions and inspirations make one’s disposition turn the mind inwards, excellent results are obtained by meditating upon God and doing *mantra* and *japa* specially. In this aspect it can be compared to the *puṇyakāla* during eclipses. After the day *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla* \(*makara Saṅkrānti*\) passes, auspicious functions like *upanayana* etc can be performed from the day next to it, which are commendable in *uttarāyaṇa*.

Question: Why one should not have oil bath on that day.?

Answer: As it is a festival day, all are generally encouraged to have an oil bath. It is not correct. Because, oil bath is one which provides inspiration for performaing *śubhakarmas*. But *Saṅkrānti* provides inspiration for *puṇyakarmas*. It is best to take bath in pure cold water on that day, and avoid a hot water bath. It is because a favourable disposition liked by the *Pitṛdevatās* is obtained by taking bath in cold water only. People who are weak may take bath in hot water from the view point of their health. We have stated earlier that taking a bath in sacred rivers like *Gaṅgā* etc. is exceptionally best.

Question: Let those who perform *pitṛ kāryas* such as *tarpaṇa* or *śrāddha* follow the above rules. Can others take an oil bath as it is a festival day?

Answer: No. It is not a day of *śubha karma* for any one. Even those who do not have to perform *tarpaṇa* and *śrāddha*, should take a holy bath and should engage themselves in meditation, *Japa*, worship and *pārāyaṇa* etc.

Question: *Śāstras* state that the misfortunes of a person get warded off if he uses sesame in six ways. The six ways are—applying of sesame oil, taking a bath after the application of the oil, perfoming *homa* with sesame, gifting sesame, consuming sesame and scattering of sesame in the form of seeds.

> तिलोद्वर्ती तिलस्नायी तिलहोमी तिलप्रदः ।  
> तिलभुक् तिलवापी च षट्तिली नावसीदति ॥ 

In what way should each of these be used on the days of *makaraSaṅkrānti*, which happens to be a festival of sesame?

Answer: Applying sesame oil to the body, taking a bath after applying the sesame oil and scattering the sesame seeds are prohibited on that day. Sesame should be used in the remaining three ways on that day, for warding off misfortunes.

Question: - Scriptures state that on the day of *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*, sesame seeds, an image of cow made of sesame seeds, and also a utensil filled with sesame seeds should be gifted. By these, afflictions and impediments get destroyed, sins are redeemed and desired progeny is obtained.

> तिलप्रदः प्रजामिष्टां दीपदश्चक्षुरुत्तमम् ।  
> तिलपात्रं प्रयच्छन्वै सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते ॥ 

Let us agree that the sesame seeds must necessarily be given as gift on that day. The gift should be offered to deserving persons. But scriptures proclaim “Accepting the gift of sesame seeds is a great sin. Even though a Brahmin may accept other gifts, he should not accept the gift of even a small quantity of sesame seeds, the gift of iron and the gift of an elephant.

> ब्राह्मणः प्रतिगृणीयात् वृत्त्यर्थं साधुतस्तथा ।   
> अत्यल्पमपि मातङ्गतिललौहांश्च वर्जयेत् ॥ 

If deserving persons honouring this proclamation do not accept *tiladāna*, then it has to be gifted inevitably to un-deserving persons. The fruits of *dāna* are not obtained if it is given to undeserving persons. When such is the case, how can one observe the precept of *dāna* for obtaining good benefits? If no one is available to accept the gift of sesame, to whom should it be gifted? Why do scriptures prescribe a rule which is difficult to follow?

		
**Answer: *Śrī Raṅgagurudeva* had elucidated the solution for this problem:-**

**“The gifting of sesame seeds has to be done. It should be offered as a *dāna* to the most deserving person. i.e., a person who is accepting the gift must be a *jnāni”***. A *jnāni* is not stuck by any sin. “तद्यथा पुष्करपलाशे आपः न श्र्लिश्यन्ति” say the *upanishats* and “लिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा” says the *Gīta. Sneha,* i.e. a kind of oily matter covers the lotus leaf. So water does not stick to it. Similarly an enlightened person has *sneha* \(friendship\) with *paramātma*; and so \(the results of his\) actions do not stick to him. Whatever is offered to him \(as *dāna*\) loses its identity and assumes the form of *Brahma*. Thus, the thing \(of *dāna*\) which had become *Brahmarūpa*, gets merged with the *jnāni* \(who is also a\) *Brahmarūpa*. So there is no question of the occurrence of sin at all. Thus the *pāpakarma* of the person who made the gift with a pure mind, gets destroyed by the fire of divine knowledge \(*jnānāgni*\) of the *jnāni*.

Question: Salutations to your *Gurudeva* for suggesting the appropriate solution for the complex problem. But it is extremely difficult to find a *Brahmajnāni* of the caliber mentioned above. When it is so, to whom should the gift be made?

Answer: Yes. It is extremely difficult to find a *jnāni* of that high caliber. Therefore the best among the available *śrotriyas* should be given the *dāna*. The person who accepts the *dāna* should get redeemed of the sin \(of accepting the gift\) by performing *praṇayāma* and *Mantrajapa* etc. If this procedure is followed, observing *dānavidhi* can meet with no hurdles.

Question: It is said in the *śāstras* that the *dāna* of sesame should be done on *makaraSaṅkrānti*. It is also said that consuming sesame is also very good. Let us agree that it is right. But, nowadays, bare sesame is not given as *dāna*. It is roasted and condiments such as roasted groundnuts, parched Bengal gram, pieces of copra and jaggery are added, and this \(mixture\) is given the name *“Eḷḷu”* and given as gift. Why should sesame be mixed with these condiments which are not prescribed by the scriptures and which add to expenses?

**Answer: When we placed this question before *Gurudeva*, he gave an easy answer that was acceptable. We present it here: “The *dāna* of sesame is made with the intention that the recipient should consume it So, the offered sesame should be in such a form that no adverse effect is caused by its consumption”**. Eating mere sesame seeds causes loosening of bowels, phlegm, and increases bile; and so health gets affected. Thus, the custom of offering of sesame mixed with roasted groundnuts, parched Bengal gram, pieces of copra and pieces of jaggery, is a wise practice indeed. When sesame mixed with the above said condiments is consumed, it causes nourishment, satisfaction and enhances taste and health. This mixture removes the blemishes of bare sesame and enhances its properties. Even though it is not stated in the *śāstravākya*s, since it is proved to be good by way of *prayoga vijnāna*, the gifting of sesame mixed with such condiments will be *śāstrīya* only.”

Question: What is the significance of performing *ārati* for children and pouring sesame over their body?

Answer: The very touch of sesame seeds wards off torments related to infancy. And the centers that are necessary for the development of infants blosoom. Therefore sesame is poured on children as per precepts, and blessings of elders are made to rain on them. As qualities similar to the above said ones are also present in jujube fruits also, they are mixed with sesame and showered on children. It should be remembered that the season for the availability of ripe jujube fruits is also around that *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*.

Question: When sesame is distributed to houses \(of relatives and friends\), pieces of sugarcane are also offered along with sesame. Why this custom is in vogue?

Answer: In this regard, *Śrīgurudeva* had told us us the *tāttvik* reasons for this pracitce. They are as follows: “In the mixture of sesame and groundnuts and jaggery etc, the pieces of sugar cane sticks are added as a sweet condiment. Consuming of that provies health, satisfaction, and nourishment of the body. And the knots on the sugar cane represent the stages \(*parva*\) of life, and the *parvas* in the path of *yoga*. The *Āgama śāstras* state that the sugar cane staff in the form of a bow which adorsn the hand of *Jaganmāta Rājarājeśvari*, is the form of the *Manas tattva*.

मनोरूपेक्षुकोदण्डायै नमो नमः

Thus the sugarcane that is used on that day has the status of both kinds i.e. *ādhibhautika* and *ādhyātmika*

Question: *Makara saṅkrānti* is called *‘pongal’*. You have stated earlier that this custom of boiling the milk in a vessel, on a purified fire place till it overflows, is in vogue in Tamilnadu. Does this custom have any significance?

Answer: There is no doubt that it has a special meaning. Sentimentally viewing, it indicates that it is a festival of extreme joy that over flows. It is also a divine custom indicatory of the experience of a *yogi* who has attained divine bliss by the practice of *yoga*. The *yogi* relishes the stream of *amṛta* that flows out from the *candramanḍala* \(*varuṇamanḍala*\), when the flood of *prana- apāna* rises up, caused by the heat of *yogābhyāsa*.

सन्तापितश्चन्द्रमसः पतन्तीं पीयूषधारां पिबतीह धन्यः \(योगातारावलि\) 

The milk that overflows by the heat of fire, beautifully reflects the above said experience of *yoga*. This ritual of making milk to overflow by boiling is also done during *gṛhapraveśa*. The custom of observing it in a special way on the day of *Saṅkrānti* which is a *navodaya parva* on which Lord *SūryaNārāyaṇa* treads the *Devayānamārga*, is still good.

Question: Why cows are worshipped on *makara saṅkrānti*?

Answer: *Gomātā* deserves to be worshipped every day. Even her *darśana* is auspicious. “लोकेऽस्मिन्मङ्गलान्यष्टौ ब्राह्मणो गौर्हुताशनः । हिरण्यं सर्पिरादित्यः आपो राजा तथाष्टमः” Accordingly the cow is considered one among the eight auspicious things. Misfortunes vanish and desires get fulfilled by the *darśana*, salutation, worship and *pradakshiṇa* of the cow.

> एतानि सततं पश्येन्नमस्येदर्चयेच्च यः ।  
> प्रदक्षिणं च कुर्वीत तथास्यायुर्न हीयते ।  
> अभिप्रेतार्थसंसिद्धिर्मङ्गलं परमं भवेत् ॥ 

*Śāstras* declare that all the fourteen worlds are hidden in the limbs of *gomātā*, and all the *devatās* reside in the different parts of its body as follows:—

> ‘गवामङ्गेषु तिष्ठन्ति भुवनानि चतुर्दश’  
दन्तेषु मरुतो देवा जिह्वयां तु सरस्वती। 

> खुरमध्ये तु गन्धर्वाः खुराग्रेषु च पन्नगाः ॥ 

> सर्वसन्धिषु साध्याश्च चन्द्रादित्यौ तु लोचने ।  
> ककुदि सर्वनक्षत्रं लाङ्गूले धर्म आश्रितः ॥ 

> अपाने सर्वतीर्थानि प्रस्रावे जाह्नवी नदी ।  
> नानाद्वीपसमाकीर्णाश्चत्वारः सागरास्तथा ॥ 

> ऋषयो रोमकूपेषु गोमये पद्मधारिणी ।  
> सन्ति रोमसु विद्याश्च शृङ्गयोरयनद्वयम् ॥ 

> धैर्यं धृतिश्च क्षान्तिश्च पुष्टिर्वृद्धिस्तथैव च ।  
> स्मृतिर्मेधा तथा लज्जा वपुः कीर्तिस्तथैव च॥ 

> विद्या शान्तिर्मतिश्चैव सन्ततिः परमा तथा ।  
> गच्छन्तीमनुगच्छन्ति एता गां वै न संशयः ॥ 

> यत्र गावो जगत्तत्र देवदेवीपुरोगमाः ।  
> यत्र गावस्तत्र लक्ष्मीः साङ्ख्यधर्मश्च शाश्वतः ॥ 

> गावः पवित्रा माङ्गल्या देवानामपि देवताः ।  
> यस्ताः शुश्रूषते भक्त्या स पापेभ्यः प्रमुच्यते ॥ 

\(*Maruddevatās* dwell in the teeth of *gomātā*. *Sarasvatī Devī* resides in her tongue. *Gandharvas* reside in the middle of her *hooves, Nāgadevatās* at the tip or ridge of the *hooves, sādhyas* at the joints, the sun and the moon in the eyes, all the stars in the hump, *Dharmadevatā* in the tail, *sarvatīrthas* in the *apāna* \(anal region\), River *Gaṅgā* in the urine, and, all the oceans with the islands and sages in the pits of her hair and *Lakshmī Devī* in *gomaya*. All the *vidyas* \(reside\) in the hairs and *dakshiṇāyana* and *uttarāyaṇa* in the horns. When the *gomātā* walks, the following viz boldness, peace, prosperity, nourishment growth, memory, *medhā*, shyness, beauty of the body, fame, knowledge, intelligence and excellent progeny follow her. There is no doubt at all in this. The entire world exists at the dwelling place of a cow. All the gods and goddesses will be present. *Lakshmīdevī* and the eternal *Saṅkhya dharma* also will be there. The cows are holy and auspicious, and are venerable as the the deity of deities. *Varāha purāṇa* states that one who serves them with devotion will be redeemed of all the sins. Such a sacred and auspicious *Gomātā* should be worshipped every day. *Gopūjā* is best in both auspicious *karmas, apara karmas* and *śrāddha karmas*. It is indeed proper to worship the revered *Gomātā* at least on the day of *Saṅkrānti* which is a special *parva*.\)

Question: A contemporary protagonist of nonviolence says: The description of the cow given above is nothing but flattery. In reality the cow is a tame animal, and a very useful animal. Its milk, curds, ghee, urine and dung are highly nourishing or purifying medicines. All the parts of its body are useful. Therefore the *Purāṇās* shower praise on the cow. Our compassionate elders say “The cow is the most mild animal, and so, as an act of kindness shown to all dumb animals representatively, the cow should be served”. Is it correct?

Answer: It is true that the cow is a mild and a dumb animal and a useful animal. It is also correct that one should show kindness to cows and all other dumb animals. But the comment that the statements of the scriptures about the cows is only flattery is not right. Why should only the cow be chosen as a representative among dumb animals ? Why not the goat? There is no answer to such questions there. Even the goat is also a very mild animal. Its milk, ghee and meat, are all useful substances, isn’t it?

Question: How is it possible to believe that *devatās* dwell in the body of cow? Recently, in one of the films, we see sequences where an atheist cuts the limbs of the cow one by one, and throws a challenge.—“Come on. Show me. Are the *maruddevatās* in this limb? Why am I not seeing *Sarasvatī Devī* in this part?”—and so on. Therefore, is not the statement that the *devatā*s dwell in the body of the cow just a matter of superstition?

Answer: Certainly not. It is a *śāstrīya* truth. i.e. a thing which conforms to *Niyamas*. The atheist who threw a challenge by severing the cow without doubt is a great fool. He does not even know the basic fact that the *devatās* are not physical entities that are visible to the external eyes, but they are true things visible only to the divine eyes. \(For example\), there are minute organisms which the scientists call ‘bacteria’. The \(above said\) \(atheist\) may be compared to a fool, who, unable to see them with bare eyes, declares “There is nothing like ‘bacteria’ at all. If they are present let them become visible”. There are things that are visible to the \(bare\) eyes. There are also very minute things that can be known only by seeing through a microscope. Likewise, there are divine things that are visible only to *jnāna dṛshṭi.* They become visible only when seen through the respective *Dṛshṭis.* If one makes a ridicule of the existence of the *devatās* without having a vision of them, it is no threat to their entity.

Question: In that case, is it possible to see those *devatās* on the body of the cow?

Answer: The right answer to these questions cannot be given by ordinary people or people with a mere bookish knowledge of the *śāstras*. **We wish to present a yogarahasya that was bestowed upon us by *ŚrīRaṅgagurudeva* pertaining to the present topic, which happens to be an interpretation that delights the \(seekers\) of truth and persons established in truth. He said -.** “A divine cow will be seen \(by a *sādhaka*\) while doing *Dhyānamanthana* in the path of *yoga*. The *darśana* of many *devatās* occurs in the limbs of that divine body which will be effulgent yet very cool. It is a sight which causes extreme bliss to the inner eye. If a *jnāni* happens to see a cow around, he experiences a remembrance of that inner vision, which produces in him an unending happiness and a sense of great reverence towards the cow. On the other hand, if a cow the external in tormented, it causes great pain world is in his inner world as the cow in the external world is also endowed with elements of the cow within. If the external cow is worshipped it will be indeed a \(reverence\) shown to the inner divine cow and causes supreme happiness”

If someone speaks contemptuously regarding cow worship without any knowledge of this *yogarahasya,* or for some other reasons praises *Gopūjā* and comments that he has shown full respect to the culture of *gopūjā*, he should be distanced by telling him to go \(*go*\) go \(*go*\) go away. Or, he should be pitied for his ignorance.

Question: Is there any distinct reason for performing the *gopūjā* specially on the day of *uttarāyaṇa puṇyakāla*?

**Answer: Yes. Here we humbly remember the exposition bestowed by *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* as follows. “The two horns of *Gomāta* are adorned by the presiding deities of *uttarāyaṇa* and *dakshiṇāyana***. As *makara Saṅkrānti* is the time of conjunction of those two, it is very proper to specially worship *‘Kāmadhenu’*, which is the abode of those presiding deities, and the cow here, which is its representative in the external world”.

Question: The answers and the explanations are very satisfying. It is indeed just to bathe the cow and decorate and make it happy on that day. But why are the cows made to leap or jump over fire??

Answer: - It is done to cause lightness in them. Also for relief from afflictions in the form of *ādhis* and *vyādhis*. Not only this, lamps of ghee and sesame oil are lighted, and curds and sweet *pumpkin* are gifted, wishing relief to all from torments.

Question: Why the day previous to *makara Saṅkrānti* is called *‘bhogi’* festival?

Answer: It is a day of the festival which has conducive environs both within and without, that facilitate the enjoyments of *Bhoga* which is not opposed to *Dharma*. The day next to it is useful for both *yogis* and *Bhogis*, but specially for *yogis*, being an auspicious and a meritorious day. One may remember that proper guidance and traditions are there in *Bhāratīya* culture to falicitate the enjoyment of both, in an appropriate way.

Question: In the tradition of the Tamil country, *‘kanū’* festival is celebrated on the day next to *Makara Saṅkrānti* in which colored food materials are placed on leaves outside the house, and sentences such as ‘Marriage and *sīmanta* to the crows and sparrows’ are uttered. Is there any significance in this custom \(*śāstra*\) women?

Answer: Do not forget the fact that all our bodies have dispositions both female and male, and consist of *Prakṛti* and *Purusha*. The customs of women are as important as that of men. These are the rituals that bring about the welfare and prosperity of the whole family and the society. The great sage *Āpastamba* has taught in his *‘Dharma śāstra’*, that even though these find no mention in the *śṛutis* and *smṛtīs*, one should respect the traditions brought by women.

स्त्रीभ्यस्सर्ववर्णेभ्यश्च धर्मशेषान्प्रतीयादित्येक इत्येके \(प्रश्न 2, पटल 11, सूत्र 16\)

Question: Let us respect the traditional practices of women. But what is the meaning of the tradition \(*śāstra*\) by women of *‘Kanū* festival’?

Answer: It is a form of *Bhūtabali*. Every *gṛhastha* has to offer *bhūtabali* as a part of *baliharaṇakarma* after *vaiśvādeva* everyday. Like the obligations such as *Devaṛṇa, Ṛshiṛṇa Pitṛṛṇa* and *Manushyaṛṇa* they have the obligation to several *bhūtās* \(also.\) To fulfill that obligation, the householders have to perform *Balipūja* with food and side dishes prepared \(with materials tought\) by the money earned by them. As *makara Saṅkrānti* is a special festival day, *Bali* to *devatā*s and *pitṛs* are offered. Women offer special *Bali* to the *Bhūtas* with the left over food of the festival of the previous day. As there are various *bhūtas* that desire food with different colors and tastes, the *balis* with different colours and tastes are offered.

Question: Which are these *bhūtas*? What benefit is obtained by their worship?

Answer: These *bhūtas* are the attendants of the Lord of destruction. \(*Śiva*\) They wander about day and night and desire *bali* from *gṛhasthas*. If the *bali* is not offered they create trouble to the householders and their progeny, with torments like untimely death etc. But, they ward off evils and also provide strength to the *gṛhasthas* who worship them. *Gṛhasthas* get their misfortunes averted and also get their desires fulfilled by offering *Bali* to them both in the morning and night, chanting the following *mantra*.

> “ये भूतेषु प्रचरन्तो दिवानक्तं बलिमिच्छन्तो वितुदस्य प्रेष्याः ।  
> तेषामहं पुष्टिकामो हरामि मयि पुष्टिं पुष्टिपतिर्दधातु स्वाहा ॥” 

Special *bali* is offered to those very *bhūtas* in the *kanū* festival, on the following day of *Saṅkrānti*.

Question: Why the words wishing the marriage and *sīmanta* to crows and sparrows are uttered, during the time of offering the oblation?

Answer: As a result of the sins committed during *dakshiṇāyana*, there is every possibility of misfortunes occuring during auspicious functions such as *sīmanta* etc, and also that children born as a result of them may get affected. The custom of passing on such torments to beasts and birds and getting onself freed from such misfortunes, is seen hinted here. We see this custom in *vaidika yajnas* which involve the sacrifice of animals and birds. The same *samskāra* is seen in these wishes of the above *‘kanū’* festival. \(Women folk wish marriage to the crows, *sīmanta* to the sparrows, wellness to their house of the parents, prosperity to the house of in-laws and success to the brothers and sisters.\)

Question: On the day of *Saṅkrānti*, there is a custom of honoring the astrologers after the *pūja* in the night and listening from them the details about the form of *Saṅkrānti mūrti* and the outcome of *Saṅkrānti*. Does *Saṅkrānti* have three heads, five mouths etc as described by the astrologers?

		
Answer: The description here does not refer to the time of *Saṅkrānti*. Time has no form. But scriptures describe that form as the form of the presiding deity of that time. It is actually the form and shape of the sins committed by people during the *dakshiṇāyana*. Is it just a poetical description or does the deity really possess such a form, one may ask. The *Āgamas* state that just as the *puṇyapurusha* possesses a form, the *Pāpapurusha* also possesses a form. They are not forms that are imagined. Deities do have form. It may be remembered here that the *Brahmasūtra*s, in the chapter *‘devatā* V*igrahavatvādhikaraṇa’* state that it becomes impossible to meditate upon them, if they don’t possess any form.

**We would like to quote here the sacred message given by *Śrīgurudeva* on the *Saṅkrānti* day of *Śrīplavanga samvatsara, pushya māsa, Pūrṇimā*, which occurred on a Monday, and conclude the discussion pertaining to *makaraSaṅkrānti*.**

“All the *karmas* that were adapted by the *sanātana Ārya Bhāratiyās* culminated in *jnāna* only, and there is naturalness in understanding them and observing them. The festival of *Saṅkrānti* is also one of such festivals and *parvas* observed by the *sanātanis*. The festival is congenial to both happiness and *parāgati*. It is festival of joy to both *Bhogis* and *Yogis*. \(This day happens to be\) the limb of the right part of *Paramātma*, the *uttarāyaṇa* which is in accordance with the path of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*, and is the north sided door to the house called the year. It is the day of opening of that door. From this day itself the *Rathotsavas* which are the wishes of God drawn by devotees, commence. It is a festival when the participation in the *utsava* of God is set to begin in all pilgrimages and temples, with the cooperation of all. It is a festival of devotees both in their hearts and in the outside world, of drawing the chariot of life towards God. This is a *puṇyakāla*. And also a *Parvakāla*. The time of distributing sugarcane with knots which represents the *Parvas* \(stages\) of life, and the time when sesame and jaggery which represent peace, are distributed. So much for *Bhoga*. And from the view point of *yoga*, it is a time when the trinity come together”.

## Nāgapūjā- Nāgarapañcamī \(Serpent Worship\)

The *Nāgapañcami* occupies an important place in the traditions brought forth by the *sanātana Āryabhāratīya Maharshis*, This is even considered by some as one of the supreme *parvas*, in place of *Akshaya tṛtīyā*. This *parva* is observed in all parts of this country by people belonging to all sects, creeds and philosophical systems. Though there are differences in the modalities of observance, all of them observe this with great devotion, faith and religious fervor. We see that this *vrata* is being observed by all, except by those who have a vow not to observe *kāmya vratas* and those who are devoted to only one deity like *Śiva, Vishṇu* etc. Even such *Ekadevopāsakas* \(devoted to a single god\) sometimes observe this as a *kāmyavrata*. People observe this *vrata* with the desires such as - “Let not serpents bite us, Let the peril from poison be averted. Let us have progeny. Let us be bestowed with wealth. Let us be free from skin diseases. Let us attain heaven”, Etc.,. This *vrata* is also observed with the objective of awakening *Kunḍalini* i.e. *Prāṇaśakti* for the early *phalasiddhi* \(results\) in *yogābhyāsa*. As the name of the *vrata* itself clearly states, the deity that is specially worshipped on this day is *Nāgadevatā*.

### When should this *vrata* be observed?

By and large this *Vrata* is observed on the *pañcami* of *śrāvaṇa śuklapaksha*.

श्रावणे मासि पञ्चम्यां शुक्लपक्षे तु पार्वति ।  
> द्वारस्योभयतो लेख्या गोमयेन विषोल्बणाः ॥ 

> सा तु पुण्यतमा प्रोक्ता देवानामपि दुर्लभा ।  
> कुर्याद्द्वादशवर्षाणि पञ्चम्यां स वरानने ॥\(भविष्योत्तर पुराण. अध्याय 36\) 

In *Saurāshṭra* \(Gujarat\) this *vrata* is observed on the *pañcami* of *śrāvaṇa kṛshṇapaksha*. The same practice prevails in Bengal also, where they worship *sarpadevi manasādevi*, who is the *mānasaputri* \(born from the mind\) of sage *Kaśyapā*.

> सुप्ते जनार्दने कृष्णपञ्चम्यां भवनाङ्गणे ।  
> पूजयेन्मनसादेवीं स्नुहीविटपसंस्थिताम् ॥\(तिथितत्त्व, तीर्थतत्त्व\) 

It is considered very auspicious if star *hasta* occurs on *jyeshṭhaśukla daśami*. We also see the precept that *Nāgadevatā Manasādevi* \(serpent goddess\) should be worshipped on that day.

> ज्येष्ठशुक्लदशम्यां तु हस्तर्क्षे ब्रह्मरूपिणी ।  
> कश्यपान्मनसादेवी जातेति मनसा स्मृता ।  
> तस्मात्तां पूजयेत्तत्र वर्षे वर्षे विधानतः ॥ 

According to *āśvalāyana* and *pāraskara gṛhyasūtras*, the *śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima* is the day on which the ritual of *Nāgapūja* called *‘sarpabali’* should be observed.

And, even though precepts state that serpent deities are to be worshipped on *daśamī* and *pūrṇimā tithi*, we find that this *vrata* is specially observed on *pañcamī tithi*, as suggested by the name *Nāgapañcamī*. “Which day has to be chosen for worship if *Pañcami* has the *vedha* of either *caturthī* or *shasṭhī*?” It shall be the day on which there is *vedha* of *Shasṭhī*. It is because *Shashṭī tithi* is very dear to *Nāgadevatās*. \(Actually speaking, *pañcamī tithi* is very dear to *Garuḍadevatā*, and *śrāvaṇa śuddha pañcamī* was called *‘Garuḍapañcamī’*; and in course of time the *Garuḍapañcamī* got transformed into *Nāgapañcamī* for the worship of *Nāgadevatās* for some reason.” - This opinion is also prevalent.\)

### *Vrataniyamas* and modalities

Though there are some differences in the modalities in the observance of this *Vrata*, the rule that the *Nāgadevatās* have to be specially worshipped on that day is commonly stated in all the precepts.

In some parts of South India, this *vrata* is observed as follows: A cradle or a cup is first made of rice flour. Two idols, one big and one small of *nāgadevatā* made of rice flour, are placed in that. Milk is sprinkled on those idols and worship is offered. \(This is called *thani ereyuvudu* in Kannada.\) Then, worshipping by offering flowers, especially with screw pine flowers, worshipping the anthill mud and grass blades also along with them, offering of milk, rice flour, puffed rice, groundnuts, *chigaLitambittu*, sweet *kadubu*, black gram *kadubu* etc., *kshirābhisheka* \(bathing with milk\) to the idol of the serpent along with the worship of family deity, special offerings, feast at homes and feeding of Brahmins etc., are done on that day.

On that day, brothers and sisters should join at a place and greet each other. Screw pine flowers \(dipped in milk \) should be used to sprinkle milk on the centers of the body like the navel, back etc., wishing coolness to those parts. And mutually salutations and blessings should be exchanged.

In some parts of the country *Nāgadevatās* are worshipped in special places outside homes also, in addition to worship at home.

We come across the following modality also. i.e. Bathing the stone images of serpents with milk at places where *nāgara kallus* \(Religiously established stone deities of *Nāgas*\) are there, sprinkling them with milk, offering of puffed rice, *pāyasa* and saltless *dosās* \(*pancakes*\).

Another modality i.e. performing of *Kshirābhisheka* to *Nāga* idols made of gold, silver or clay. Offering worship with *Karavīra* \(oleander\) flowers, *Jāji* \(jasmine\) and offering of *Dhūpa* and *dīpa,* feeding of Brahmins with dinner which includes ghee and *pāyasa* is also in vogue.

The *Bhavishyottara purāṇa* states that, on that day, both sides of the door should be adorned with pictures of *Nāgas* drawn with cow dung, and, worship should be offered to those deities with curds, soft blades of *dūrva* \(panic grass\), *darbhas*, sandal paste and flowers.

द्वारस्योभयतो लेख्या गोमयेन विषोल्बणाः\(हेमाद्रि, प्रभासखण्ड\)

One more modality is also there. It is as follows:

Those who worship *Manasādevi* should do a *saṅkalpa* with the words “I am worshipping *Manasādevi* to get over the fear of snakes”, and should invoke that deity and other *Nāgadevatās* in a *kshīrāvṛksha* by name *‘snuhī’*. If that \(tree\) is not available, they should be invoked either in a pot filled with water or in mere water, and both \(deities\) should be worshipped. Neem leaves should be placed inside the house, and they should be offered to the deities. And then they should be served as *prasāda* to Brahmins, and the devotee also should take them.”

“The idols of serpents should be worshipped on a wooden plank, with red sandal paste, Or, yellow or black coloured idol of a serpent should be bought and milk should be sprinkled on them, and *naivedya* should be offered. If snake charmers happen to come with serpents near the house, the serpents should be offered milk and the snake charmers should be gifted with cash. Later, food items in the *prasāda* \(which include preparations\) that are bitter, pungent, astringent and sweet in taste, should be taken in the same order.”

“Figures of five headed serpents should be drawn \(or should be gotten drawn\) from a pen made of gold, silver, wood or mud. They \(the serpents\) should then be worshiped with *Hālukhīru* \(A sweet liquid prepared from milk\) *pañcāmṛta*, \(a preparation made from mixing cow milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar\), *karavīra* flowers and lotus flowers, *gandha, dhūpa* and *dīpa*. Afterwards brahmins should be fed with *laddu* and *Hālukhīru*. The priest who performes the worship should be gifted with a cow and a golden idol of *nāga*.”

“The eight *Nāga devatās* that should be worshipped on that day as stated in the *Bhavishyattora Purāṇa* are:

1. वासुकिः 
2. तक्षकश्चैव 
3. कालियो 
4. मणिभद्रकः । 
5. ऐरावतो 
6. धृतराष्ट्रः 
7. कार्कोटक 
8. ‘धनञ्जयौ’ 

> \(एतेऽभयं प्रयच्छन्ति प्राणिनां प्राणजीविनाम्\)\(भविष्योत्तर पुराण 32-2-7\) 

Another precept says-

The main *nāgadevatas* are twelve in number. They are *ananta*, *Vāsuki*, *Śankha*, *Padma*, *Kambala*, *Kārkotaka*, *Dhṛtarāshṭra*, *Śankhaka*, *Kāḷiya*, *Takshaka*, *Piṅgaḷa* and *Maṇibhadhraka*. There is also a custom of worshipping each of these in the twelve months of a year, i.e. worshipping one deity every month.”

“Those who observe these *Vratas* should exercise extraordinary restraints \(on themselves\). Food should be taken only once on *Caturthī*.On *pañcami* fasting should be observed during day time, and food should be had only in the night.”

		
*Nāgarapañcami* is a festival in which the *Nāgadevata* is worshipped. Why did this custom of worshipping a serpent as *devata* came to be practiced in India? Modern scholars have their own conjectures. “It is utter foolishness to worship *Nāgas*. It is the ultimate in blind belief. It is ludicrous and also nauseating” is the remark of many.

These conjectures and objections can be compiled as follows:

		
1\) This practice is found not only in India but also in China, Africa and in some places such as the forest areas of South America, as a tradition. All should indeed worship God who is beyond cosmos and the controller of the universe and who is the embodiment of supreme bliss and divine knowledge and the one who grants all our desires. It is indeed stupidity to worship anything else other than Him and especially, attributing Godliness to animals and living beings that are very inferior to human beings in HIS creation, and which are fit to be slain by him. Is it not further foolishness to worship a cruel creature that kills by injecting venom?

2\) There are religions which state that this is a wicked creature which kills innocent people for no reason, by biting and injecting venom, and so should be killed at sight. Christianity and Islam consider Satan and his followers viz the wicked devils as the ones who possess the form of serpents. So, whenever possible they kill them thinking that it is a meritorious act to kill the serpents. The serpent is a cold blooded animal and a despicable creature. It is their custom to use the words “You cold blooded worm\!”, to abuse some one. Anyway, it is the meanest thing to worship \(the serpents\) and let there be no doubt about it, they say.

But why at all did the custom of worshipping serpents come into practice in any country or race? And especially why has this tradition come to be practiced by the *Sanātana Bhāratīyas*?

1. “Serpents are of help to man. A mouse is a troublesome animal which steals and eats our food grains. Serpents help us greatly by devouring these mice and other creatures such as worms, which cause us problems. So the practice of worshipping it, gratefully respecting it as God came into vogue.”—This is the opinion of some people.

2. There are people who argue that the snake is a creature with terrifying and poisonous teeth and people who live in villages and forest areas are always afraid of them. So with the fearful superstition that they do not bite if they are worshipped, the practice came into vougue. There are some who actually offer milk to real snakes. Others afraid to do so, offer worship to idols of serpents made of stone, metal, and mud. There are some devout people who advise and also object with the words - “Why don’t you worship *Nāgadevas*. Will not *Nāgappa* hiss at you \(If you don’t worship\)?.” \(But they seem to have forgotten the direct experience that *Nāgappa* hisses even at people who offer milk to him\).

3. “Not All snakes are poisonous. True. But who can make out which one is poisonous and which is not?”—With this thinking, some consider all serpents as worshipful.

4. There are some who pity the practice of believers, say- “These people, not only worship snakes but also ridiculously create the comfort of the association of snakes to other gods whom they worship\!” For example, we come across the praise of the *Nāgas* as follows: “O *Śeshanāga*\! You are a seat to *Nārāyaṇa* while sitting and moving, a pair of sandals while walking, a sacred piece of silk to wear, an umbrella and a jewel lamp while walking, and a bed to sleep. You are offering your service to the Lord in every way. Salutations to you\!” Lord *Śiva* is a *Nāgābharaṇa* \(bedecked with serpents\), *Gaṇesa* has it as his abdominal belt, and Lord *Subrahmaṇya* is the form of *Nāga* himself. The bracelets, waist band, armlets ear ornaments and the holy thread of Lord *Garuḍa* are all nothing but great serpents like *Vāsuki, Takshaka Kārkoṭaka* etc. There is a feeling that they do not bite gods, even though they are known to bite people. The practice of wearing *Nāgābharaṇa* \(ornaments in the shape of serpents,\) and sporting a plait resembling a snake is prevalent in the *Sanātana Ārya Bhārtīyas*, even though they fear the serpents.

Some put forth a clever historical theory with a loud bang as follows: “This worship of *Nāgas* was not prevalent in the *Āryans*. It was in vogue in *Dravidians,* especially in the forest dwellers called *Nāgas* among them. In the later period, the Aryans included this Dravidian custom in their tradition.” Their argument continues- “Aryans who came from outside, defeated the native Dravidians in various battles and suppressed them. People belonging to the *Nāga* race were also in that group of suppressed people. The Aryans exhibit their pride of crushing *‘Nāga’* people, through the story of *Śrīkṛshṇa* trampling the heads of *Kāliṅga Nāga*. But what happened? Note the pages in history. Romans defeated Greeks by their brute force, but in the fields of culture and civilization, Greeks had the upper hand. So the Romans had to incorporate the important features of Greek culture in theirs. In this way the vanquished race defeated the victors from the point of view of culture. The same thing happened in India also. Even though *Āryans* triumphed over the ancient native Dravidians using their brute force and cunning tactics, they adopted the superior culture and religion \(of the Dravidians\) in their own culture and religion. One of such features adopted is *nāgapūja*.”

A certain category of *Dravidians* who lived among the serpents in the forest, who worshipped serpents, whose flags bore the insignia of serpents and who wore ornaments shaped like serpents , came to be called *‘nāgas’*. In course of time some Aryans established marital relationship with *nāgas*. In the *Mahābhārata, Arjuna* marrying *ulūpi*, a *nāga* girl, and *Bhīmasena* treated respectfully as a kin by *Nāgarāja* himself when he went to the *Nāgaloka*, are examples for this.

In ancient days people lacked the knowledge of science. Their life was based only on beliefs. Now the situation has changed. A lot of scientific research has been done on different kinds of snakes. We extract venom from the poisonous teeth of snakes and use it for medicinal purposes. We skin the snakes and use their skin. There is a big increase in the number of “great” science teachers and their disciples, who remove the poisonous parts from the body of the snakes and use their flesh as food to fatten their own bodies\! There are people who remove the poisonous teeth from the snakes and make them \(the snakes\) perform stunts of various kinds, and make a living out of it. When such is the case, it amounts to insulting modern science, if the meaningless tradition of the worship of *nāgas* is continued even now, which is like a person hanging himself to a banyan tree, obsessed with the sentiment that the tree was planted by his father\!

“Not just this. The snake is an ungrateful cruel creature and a mean animal. If a dog is fed it not only wags its tail in gratitude but also serves with loyalty. But this snake is a vicious and a ferocious creature that bites and kills even the man who feeds it with milk. The wise can imagine the level of the culture of the people who worship them”. This is the argument they advance.

Now we need to discern whether worshipping *Nāgas* on *Nāgapañcamī* and other days is scientific or just a blind belief, by discussing these opinions without any preconceived notions.

1. The tradition of worshipping *Nāgadevatas* was introduced in our country by the *Āryabhārata Maharshis*. Generally all are aware that the cobra is a cruel, ungrateful, vicious and a ferocious creature. If it is fed with milk, it will only increase the poison in that creature. If such a wicked creature is killed, even saints would feel happy and relieved. When such is the case, even to think that this fact has not come to the notice of the sages and therefore they preached *Nāgapūja* would be wrong. *Jnānis* in several contexts have clearly proclaimed.

“पयःपानं भुजङ्गानां केवलं विषवर्धनम्”

\(If snakes are fed with milk it results only in the increase of poison.\)

मोदेत साधुरपि वृश्चिकसर्पहत्या”भागवत 7-9-14 

\(If scorpions and snakes are killed, even pious people would feel happy\)

2. It is also not correct to guess that the custom of worshipping snakes came into vogue because they eat mice, frogs, insects and worms and help \(the farmers\). The snake eats these insects and worms as food and not to benefit us. The enlightened ones have not advised the worship of cat, eagle and crows which devour mice.

3. The argument that the ancients brought forth the practice of worshipping them out of the fear of people getting bitten by them, is also not correct. Because they have not advised the worship of ferocious animals like tigers and other creatures which are more ferocious and poisonous than snakes.

4. In our *Śāstras, Nāgas, Yakshas, Gandharvas* and others are considered to be of divine origin. \(*Bhāgavata* 7-8\) . So it is not in conformity with scriptures to consider them as the present day clan of *‘Nāgas’* who dwell in the forests in our country. There is no authentic evidence whatsoever for this.

“Aryans considered themselves superior to the people of the *nāga* race. They subdued these forest dwellers. The trampling of *Kāḷiṅga* by *Śrī Kṛshṇa* is a symbol of the suppression of *Nāga* race by Aryans”—is an argument of some, which is nothing but a figment of blind imagination. This is because the very same *Āryamaharshis* have referred to themselves as humans and the *nāgas* as deities. They have not stated anywhere that they are superior to the *nāgas* and that they have suppressed the *Nāgas* who are inferior. And, *Śrīkṛshṇa* did not trample all *Nāgas*.

5\) The criticism that it is ludicrous to imagine serpents as beds and ornaments etc for Gods *Vishṇu*, *Śiva* and others is not a remark borne out of proper judgment. Only when the real form of *Nāgasarpas* which are described by *jnānis* as the bed and ornament etc of Gods is understood in the real sense, the habit of making such baseless criticisms ends.

Then which is the *Nāgasarpa* that our *Arya Maharshis* instructed us to worship?

At the outset, they appear to be the same serpents which we see around. But we come across descriptions in the works of sages which state that *Nāgarāja Ādiśesha* has five, seven or a thousand hoods, and he is a form having the features of both human beings and serpents. The serpents we see around us do not have these features. Whatever may be it, the origin of the *Nāgasarpas* which the sages have asked us to worship, has to be found out in the *jnāna bhūmi* only. The actual picture of that \(origin\) cannot be found in this material world. Only when one enters the spiritual world, the *prāmaṇikasvarūpa* \(real form\) of that can be known.

Also the *śāstras* which tell about the experience of the spiritual world, happen to be guiding lamps for us in the beginning. According to those *śāstras*, the *Nāgasarpa* is the *kunḍalinī* or the *prāṇic* force which is visualized by the *yogis*. The flow of this *kunḍalinī* force resembles the movements of a serpent. This *kunḍalinī* which is present in our *mūladhāracakra* area resembles a sleeping coiled cobra and it helps people to digest their food. It exists in equal proportion in men and eunuchs but in a larger proportion among women, and it helps them in procreation. But in *yogasādhakas* it acts like a serpent awakened from sleep, opens its hood, raises up to the *‘sahasrāra’*, and makes them drink the nectar of the divine bliss and returns to its abode in *mūladhāra*. This science of awakening *kunḍalini* which helps in attaining the ultimate accomplishment is called *‘kunḍalinī yoga’* in *yogaśāstras*. In all the methods that lead to self realization, this *kunḍalinī* awakening has to take place. It is also possible to visualise this in its real form. The effects of this can be seen in one’s nature. It can also be experienced in *samādhi yoga* according to *jnānis*.

> मूलोन्निद्रभुजङ्गराजमहिषीं यान्तीं सुषुम्नाध्वना ।\(शारदातिलक\) 

> उत्थापिताधार हुताशनोल्कैः ।  
> उन्निद्रितायां भुजगाङ्गनायाम् ।  
> सन्तापितात् चन्द्रमसः पतन्तीम्  
> पीयूषधारां पिबतीह धन्यः ॥\(शङ्कराचार्य योगतारावली\) 

This *Kunḍalini* which is the *prāṇaśakti* has been referred to by the *Purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* as *ananta*, *Ādhiśesha*, *saṅkarshaṇa* etc.

That very *Kunḍalinī* is the one which keeps beaming as the divine umbrella over the heads of supreme deities such as Lord *Nārāyaṇa*, *śambhu, Sarasvatī* etc who are rich in yogic wealth and are beyond the natural state of the mind, intellect and senses.

Though the pranic power is one and the same, it functions differently at different parts of the body such as the heart, anus, throat, navel and other parts:

प्राणापानव्यानोदानसमाना मे शुद्ध्यान्तां ज्योतिरहम् ।\(महानारायण\) 

> हृदि प्राणो गुदेऽपानः समानो नाभिसंस्थितः ।  
> उदानः कण्ठदेशस्थः व्यानः सर्वशरीरगः  
> सप्त प्राणाः प्रभवन्ति\(याज्ञिकी उपनिषत्\) 

***“Śāstras* say that these function are five, seven or infinite. Though they remain in different parts \(of the body\) and keep doing different functions in ordinary people, all of them by coming together rise up and ascend undirectionally to the *sahasrāra* in the *Brāhmī* state. The pranic forces which in the state of unison reach the top, are the hoods of the divine *Ādiśesha* which are seen as five, seven or a thousand hoods. In this way, as all them focus all their functions in the Lord, and become one with the lord. Therefore they do not have any hostility with their natural enemy the *garutmān*. *Garutmān* too is immersed in the meditation of the lord indeed\! “Both of them, in the presence of the Lord, are immersed in looking at the Lord only, without looking at each other. Therefore there is no scope for any enmity” was the remark of *Śrī Raṅgamahāguru*, which we remember here with reverence.**

“मुक्तशेषविरोधेन कुलिशव्रणलक्ष्मणा ।  
> उपस्थितं प्राञ्जलिना विनीतेन गरुत्मता ॥”\(रघुवंश -10\) 

*Mahākavi Kālidāsa* describes thus Lord *Garuḍa*, who happens to be in such a state.

The complexion of *śeshadeva*, who is one with the supreme lord who is purest, is also pure white. *“sitavimalatanuh”* say the *yogaśāstras*. This totally divine *kunḍalinī* which is immensely enjoyed by the Lord, which is most obedient and which is a *śeshabhūta* \(a remainder\) of *Lord Nārāyaṇa* is called *‘śesha’*. The very same *‘kunḍaliniśeshanāga’* is a dear ornament of *Mahādeva* who is the Lord of *Prāṇa*.

This *Kunḍalinī* force, at certain times, can be hostile and can also cause a hindrance in the path \(of realization\) of god. In that state it is called *Kāliṅganāga*. *ŚrīKṛshṇa* the supreme god and the great master of *Yoga* trampled on the hoods of that *Kāḷiṅganāga* and played the marvellous *‘Yogatānḍava’* on it. Because of that trampling, all it’s demonical temperaments vanished and it became obedient to him. The Lord’s foot marks on its hoods became an adornment. In remembrance of this only, the custom of calling the mark on the hood of a cobra as *‘Vishṇupāda’* has come into vogue.

The snakes which adorn several parts of the *divyamaṅgalavigraha* \(divine auspicious form\) of *Garuḍadeva* are also such impediments. But, they can cause no trouble to him as he is a *Mahāyogi*, and thus remaining under his control, they adorn him as ornaments. He has the capacity to devour them immediately. If they ever venture to cause him any trouble. Also, they do not attack pure hearted souls who are bestowed with the grace of god.

This *Kunḍalinī* force not only helps one to attain the *brahmī* state but also in their functions, fecilitates the *upāsakas* to obtain progeny and cure the diseases etc. The ritual of *Nāgapratishṭhā* \(installation of *nāga* idols\) belongs to this kind of *upāsanāvidhi*. The form of *Kunḍalini* such as *Vāsuki* and other devatas happen to be the reigning deities for the *Kaṅkaṇas* \(bracelets of Cords\) worn in the hand \(or wrist\) during auspicious ceremonies.

The *nāgadevatās* also figure among the *Navatantudevatās* \(the nine deities\) of the *Yajnopavīta*. The lower order of *Nāgadevatās* attain their \(accomplishments\) by even the small powers of the *kunḍalinī* deity. Thus, when discerned in the philosophical real sense, \(it becomes known\) that *Nāgas* are not \(at all\) a human race. They are distinct powers of the inner world, visible only to the *yogis*.

Thus, in order to help ordinary people to ascend to the divine *Bhāva* of the *Nāgadevatās* who can be experienced only in the suprasensory inner world, the *Maharshis* brought forth in the tradition of worshipping the idols of *Nāgadevatās* in the physical world also. So it is hardly any wisdom to assign a period, in terms of B.C., A.D. etc., to the *Śaktiviśeshas* \(distinct powers\) which are being experienced by the enlightened ones from time immemorial.

It is no discretion to state that \(divine phenomena such as\) the union of god and the soul, the movement of the *praṇaśaktis* etc started on such and such a day.

In the cobras we see around, this *kunḍalini śakti* will be present at least in small measures. If they are killed, the tranquility of the *Kunḍalini* inside \(us\) gets hurt.Therefore, the scriptures state a general rule forbidding the killing of cobras. Though all the cobras naturally have the features such as hood, poisonous teeth etc, we can see that they \(the cobras\) vary in aspects like the place of their dwelling, attributes and complexion such as white, red, yellow, black etc. It is totally prohibited to kill the pure white complexioned *Nāgasarpas* among them. They are symbols of pure *kunḍalinī* power.

It becomes indeed inevitable to kill a cobra in self defence, when it attacks a person. In such cases, atonement of that sin has to be done by *Prāyascitta*.

> दानेन च धनेनैकः सर्पादीनामशक्नुवन् ।  
> एकैकं स चरेत् कृच्छ्रं द्विजः पापापनुत्तये”\(मत्स्यपुराण 227-341\) 

It is sinful to hunt and kill serpents for no reason. By doing so one will be incurring the displeasure of the *kunḍalinī devatā.*

It is natural for people to get scared when they happen to encounter a cobra. It is also true that it may even attack the very people who feed it with milk. Several stories are narrated in this regard in our country. One such story runs as follows: A cobra was suffering, as a thorn was struck in its mouth. A pious man who happened to pass by, saw it, fearlessly went near it and removed the thorn from it’s mouth and provided relief to it. But this type of fearlessness, kind disposition \(of that *Sādhu*\), and gratitude of the serpents etc., are not to be taken as a general rule. But no one need to fear the worshipping of the idols of serpents.

**Does not one get frightened when he visualises snakes with five hoods, seven hoods etc in deep meditation? No.Because there wont be any entanglements such as shyness, fear etc. in the *Samādhi yoga*.We would like to humbly remember an explanation provided by *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* in this regard.**

**Goddess *Sarasvati* is splendidly described in a poem in the beginning of *Jaimini Bhārata* of the Great kannada poet *Lakshmiśa.* A modern critic commenting on that poem remarked— “Upto this point the descriptions are fine. But the poet, all of a sudden, brings in an awful comparison. By the word *Phaṇiveṇi* \(i.e. a lady with her plait resembling a serpent\), dreadfulness makes an ingress in a beautiful depiction here.”—When this was brought to the kind notice of *Śrī Gurudeva*, he said - “The critic might have experienced a fear here. But *Lakshmīśa*, the devotee poet had no such fear because, at that point of time he was in a *yogasamādhi* \(deep meditation\) which is beyond fear, sorrow, bitterness and delusion”.**

**“The poet is enjoying the experience of *‘Ādiśesha’* who fills the \(heart of the\) devotees who are visualizing delightfully the blissful *Jaganmāta* \(the mother of the universe\) and \(*Ādiśesha*\) who is serving her. The poet seeing the similarity of *Ādiśesha* in the plait of the goddess experiences the \(same\) bliss. People who do not have the required aesthetic sense are not fully qualified to experience the poetic sentiment of that poem”.**

**This explanation brought happiness and peace to our minds also.**

The *Nāgas* worshipped during this festival are distinct *devatās*. The vision of *devatās* can be possible only in the supersensory realm. However great may be a person in other fields, his opinions pertaining to *“Nāgara”* \(the deity\) relevant to this *parva* cannot be honoured, if he does not possess a first hand knowledge of the supra sensory realm. “How many books he has studied\! How knowledgeable are his words”—One may say with awe. But, \(just because of these feats alone\), their words may not stand up to authority. The determining intellect \(based on true experience\) is onlyone. They can only serve as examples to the words of *Śrī Kṛshṇa* who said -

“बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम्”

The intellect of the undecided \(i.e. ignorant ones\) has millions of branches \(opinions\).

And, it should not be concluded that this *atīndriyajnāna* became possible to only some people at some point of time in the past. It is a universal phenomenon that can be experienced at all times and places by the fortunate ones who have purified their senses, mind and intellect by *tapas* \(penace\), *dhyāna* and *Samādhi*.

If so, what exposition is put forth by such persons who have the supra sensory experience pertaining to the *nāgas* who are adored in this *parva*?

“These *nāgas* are not the cobras which we see around in the external world. They are not of human race also. They have a divine origin and they are *siddhas* \(accomplished with supernatural powers\). They possess the capacity to appear and disappear in any place at their will.

ते चान्तर्दधिरे नागाः पाण्डवस्यैव पश्यतः\(महाभा. आदिपर्व 39-30\)

They have the capability to grant boons or to chastise. By nature they are prone to anger generally. But when pleased by the worship of the deovtees, they bestow upon them with progeny, prosperity etc. All of them are various forms of *Kunḍalinī* or *Prāṇaśakti*. Among them some are dispositioned favourably towards *Paramātmabhāva* and some are hostile. Those who are hostile should be overcome by the grace of *Garuḍa* the *vedapurusha* \(the *Vedas* personified\), or his master Lord *Vishṇu,* and then one can proceed further in the *Yogamārga*. And among them \(i.e. the *Nāgas*\) *Ādiśesha* is the *Mahātma* who is *Śuddhasattvamaya* \(wholly of pure nature\) who has completely abated the *triguṇas*. He possesses an effulgent form of pure white complexion and is totally a *śeshabhūta* to the Lord. Those who belong to his category are indeed *Anurūpas* \(the ones who conform to the Lord\). It is possible to visualize these diverse *Nāgadevatās* with their forms and attributes in the inner world. To facilitate this inner vision and the accomplishment of desires, the custom of worshipping the idols of *Nāgadevatās* has come into practice. And, the *Kunḍalinīśakti* does exist in the cobras which are seen around, at least to a small extent.

### Some doubts and questions

A few important doubts pertaining to *nāgapañcami*.

Which is the actual name of this *parva*? Is it *‘Garuḍa pañcami’* or *‘Nāgapañcami’*, or, are both the names authentic? Why is it that the term *Nāgapañcami* has gained special currency? This is the first question.

This *pañcamī tithi* is dear to *Garutmān,* who is divine knowledge incarnate. He may be specially worshipped on that day. But there is a special reason to call this festival as *Nāgapañcami* in our custom, during which *Nāgas* are worshipped on the day of worship of *Garuḍa*, who happens to be the enemy of *Nāgas*.

Long ago *Garutmān* used to kill all kinds of *Nāgas* indiscriminately, be they pious or wicked. When he indulged in attacking *Nāgas* who were devotees of God also, the Lord broke his arrogance. In memory of that, *Garutmān* declared. “Let the *nāgas* who are devotees of God be worshipped on the day \(earmarked\) for my worship. I myself shall be pleased by the worship.” This is the story on which the above custom is based.\(This is not the story of *Jīmūtavāhana* of the *Bauddha Jātaka* tales\). Among the *Nāgadevatās*, there are many who are very dear \(and helpful\) to God. They are respected by *Garutman* also. There is not much of a difference between such *nāgas* who are intensely devoted to God and *Garutmān* himself, the supreme devotee. Both indeed are forms of pure *prāṇaśakti*. As *kunḍalinī* is called ‘sacred pranic force’, God *Garuḍa* is also called *‘prāṇasya prāṇah anyah’*. Worshipping either one of them who dwell in the *Brāhmī* state will result in the worship of the divine *prāṇaśakti* itself. *Garuḍa* too considers the worship of *śesha* as his own worship. Here, we see the principle that, the worship of either of them culminates in the \(worship of the\) *prāṇaśakti* of God only.

2\) What should be our attitude towards cobras we see around? This is the second question.

Let us agree that the *Nāgas* that should be worshipped on *Nāgapañcami* are *Nāgadevatās* which are beyond the realm of senses. It may also be true that the worship of the idols of *Nāgadevatas* is helpful in earning their favour. But all generally know the nature of cobras that are seen around. They bite and kill people out of fear or anger. Their terrible vengeance is well known. There are examples of snakes biting and killing even those who came to offer them milk. So, is it a sin to kill this wicked creature which kills innocent people?

It is but natural that people also beat them to death out of fear just as they kill humans out of fear and anger. Sometimes it becomes unavoidable to beat them to death, indeed\!

All this is true. But, killing of cobras belonging to the superior category for any reason, leads to the harm of the *kunḍalinī śakti*. Because *kunḍalinī śakti* will be present in them at least to a small extent. So, they should not be killed unnecessarily. It is best to keep away from killing serpents \(of any kind\). If they are inevitably killed, appropriate atonement should be observed and the sin accrued has to be expiated.

Normally cobras do not bite people who do not disturb them. They bite only those who are seized by *kālasarpa* \(serpent of time\). It is not right to kill any or every serpent that one comes across, merely out of fear or the illusion caused by the impression that snakes kill people.

We come across the story of *‘Ruru-pramadvarā’* in the *Ādiparva* of *Mahābhārata*. In that story a cobra bites to death a girl by the name *Pramadvarā* who was engaged to the son of a sage by name *Ruru*. Enraged by this *Ruru* goes on killing every snake he comes across. Then one of the snakes by name *‘ḍunḍubha’* tells him and enlightens him thus: “We do not belong to the category of snakes who bite and kill humans. You are not justified in killing all the snakes under the impression that snakes of our category \(also\) bite and kill humans. *Ahimsā* \(Non-violence\) is the *paramadharma* \(supreme righteousness\). “अन्ये ते भुजगा ब्रह्मन् ये दशन्तीह मानवान् । डुण्डुभानहिगन्धेन न त्वं हिंसितुमर्हसि. . . अहिंसा परमो धर्मः सर्वप्राण भृतां वर” \(*Mahābhārata Ādiparva* chapter-10 *śloka*.3-130\)

This advice should be kept in mind by all.

We would like to conclude this chapter on *Nāgapañcami parva* by discussing one or two important questions.

1. When and for what reason has this custom of *nāgapūja* come into vogue in India? This is the first question. For this some modern critics give the following answer:

“There is no reference to *nāgapūja* in the *Ṛgveda*. Instead only the subject matter of *‘nāgasamhāra’* \(destruction of serpents\) is found. It is said that *Indra* killed *vṛtrāsura* when he had assumed the form of a serpent. \(*Ṛgveda samhita* 2-30\)

But in the *taittirīya* and *vājasaneya samhitās* there is a recitation in salutation to *nāgasarpas*.

“नमोऽस्तु सर्पेभ्यो ये केचन पृथिव्यामनु,  
> ये अन्तरिक्षे तेभ्यः सर्पेभ्यो नमः” 

> “इदग्ं सर्पेभ्यो हविरस्तु जुष्टम्  
> आश्रेषे येषामनुयन्तिचितं तेभ्यः सर्पेभ्यो मधुमज्जुहोमि” 

A *mantra* in the *nakshatrasūkta* wishes a *‘svāhākāra’* \(utterance of the exclamation *‘svāhā’*\) to *sarpas* who are the reigning deities of the star *Āśleshā*. The *Atharvaveda* mentions the names of *mahāsarpas* such as *takshaka*, *Dhṛtarāshṭra, pārāvata* etc. *Kāṭhaka* considers *sarpas* among the *‘pañcajanas’* \(gods with the appearance of the human form\). So, in the later periods of times, *sarpas* came to be considered as a separate class like the *devas*, *gandharvas, pitṛs* and others. In the *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas* also, *sarpas* came to be considered as a separate class.

“Why did the worship of the serpents begin? It is because of the fear of serpents. \(Even today around ten thousand people die of snake bites in this country every year\)’. Thus, the practice of observing \(rituals like\) *Sarpabali, Nāgapūja* etc. came into vogue with the objective of praying them not to bite human beings.

It is indeed commendable that information relating to this custom which is stated in our religious texts has been compiled chronologically. But it is not correct to conclude that the concept of worshipping *nāgas* in our country is of a later origin. Because, nowwhere it is stated with avouchment in the *Ṛgveda* that only a specific number of deities are to worshipped and gods other that these do not exist at all. Nor can it be proved that all the *Ṛgveda mantras* handed over by the *Maharshis* in the tradition are available with us. As soul, god and nature are *Anādi* \(of incomprehensible origin\) the tradition of worshipping them must also be *Anādi*. And, the *nāgadevatās* prescribed by the *jnānis* for worship, are none other than the forms of *Prāṇaśakti*, say the enlightened personages.

If the practice of the worship of *Nāgadevatas* were to exist in the Ṛgvedic times, why does indeed the *Ṛgveda Samhitāmantra* state that *Indra* killed a demonic serpent? It is because, there are some varieties of *Kunḍalinī* form of serpent *śakti* which cause obstacles to the *Devamārga* \(path of the gods\). Those need to be chastised, by *devatas* say the *yogis*. The story of *Śrīkṛshṇa* crushing *Kāḷiṅganāga* is well known in the *Purāṇas*. The argument that *Bhāratīyas* began to worship *nāgadevatās* with the wish that poisonous snakes shall not bite them is also not correct. Because the *mantras* which are recited to pray the *Nāgadevatās* are not restricted just to wish that the serpents shall not bite or kill people. We come across *stotramantras* \(*mantras* of praise\) which pray those *Nāgadevatās* for progeny, warding off diseases, and attainment of *yoga*.

In addition to this, it should be remembered that the *Maharshis* have not prescribed the worship of cobras we see around, but the worship only of some distinct deities. They have the forms of both the serpents and deities. They are described as adorned with divine embellishments and divine weapons. These \(descriptions\) are not mere poetic imaginations. In the *Pūjakalpas* it is stated that *upacāras* such as *Arghya*, *pādya, Acamanīya, snāna, vastra, yajnopavīta, comb*, collyrium, perfumes, mirror etc have to offered to them. All know well that these are not the *upacāras* that are received by the cobras seen around.

“The month *śrāvaṇa* comes in the rainy season. During that time, the snakes happen to enter the households either to devour mice, frogs etc or to escape from the rain waters. At times they bite people also to death. This is the reason for prescribing *sarpabali* on the *pūrṇima* of *śrāvaṇa* and *Nāgapūja* on *Pañcami*” - This is the commentary of some people. Even this cannot be a satisfactory explanation. Because, there is a custom of performing *nāga* worship in the month of *pushya* and on *Subbarāyana Shashṭhī* \(The sixth day of *Margaśira* prescribed for the worship of *Subrahmaṇya*\) also. There is a religious custom of invoking *nāgadevata* in the *yajnopavīta* also that is worn from time to time. “तृतीयो नागदैवत्यः चतुर्थः सोमदैवत्यः” \(*devalasmṛti, smṛticandrikā, samskāra kānda*\). We invoke *Nāgadevatās* in the *pratisara* \(*kaṅkana*\) which is tied around the wrist during auspicious occasions and worship them with the utterence “वासुकिदेवताभ्यो नमः”. We come across a ritual called *Nāgabali* observed in weddings. These rituals which involve *Nāgapūja* are being observed in seasons other than the rainy season also.

So, the reason for performing *Nāgadevata pūja* on *Pañcami* and *pūrṇima* is not the \(helpfulness of the\) rainy season but \(that it is\) a distinct time which facilitates both the internal and external situations to earn the grace of the *Nāgadevatās*.

“The *Gṛhyasūtras* state that the ritual of *Nāgabali* should be performed on *pūrṇima*. But, the *Itihāsas* and *Purāṇas* enjoin *Pañcami* and *Shasṭī* for *Sarpadevatā* worship. Why is this? This is the other question.

Actually speaking all these three *tithis* are excellent for the worship of the *sarpadevatās*. Among them, the *pañcami tithi* is dear to the deity *garuḍa* also. In all these *tithis* it is *kunḍalini* or *prāṇaśakti* that is being worshipped. There are many types in the *Prāṇaśaktis* ie the *Nāgadevatās*. Even the benefits the devotees pray them for are diverse. For this reason different *tithis* have been prescribed for the worship of *nāgadevatas*. All the three conform to the *śāstras*.

\(3\) Another question is whether worship is to be offered to mere *Nāgasarpas* or even to the ones with no hoods, and whether there is any difference between *nāgas* and *sarpas*.

Lord *Kṛshṇa* tells *Arjuna* in the *Bhagavad gītā-* “I am *vāsuki* among *sarpas* and *ananta* among *Nāgas*”. \(सर्पाणां वासुकिश्चास्मि” “अनन्तश्चास्मि नागानाम्”\)

Therefore *sarpas* and *Nāgas* belong to two different categories. Just as there are common features in both of them, it is clear that there are differences also. Scholars give many opinions regarding the differences\!\!

“The serpents with hood are called cobras. Whereas all the serpents are called *‘Sarpa’*s. Even the scriptures say that the word *‘sarpa’* refers to all reptiles But the word *‘nāga’* refers to snakes with a hood and a mark of lotus on the hood.”- This is one opinion.

वस्तुतस्तु सर्पसंज्ञा सर्वेषामपि गोनसाजगरादीनामपि सामान्या, यथा चतुष्पदां पशुसंज्ञा, नागसंज्ञा च सटादिमतां सिह्मसंज्ञेव सफणानां पद्माद्यङ्कितानां च विशिष्टा”\(अविगीता\)

2.*Vāsuki* and the like are *nāgas*. Those which belong to a lower category of snakes like *alagarda* and others are *sarpas*. \(*kullūka. Manusmrti.tīka* - 137\)

3. Serpents with a single hood are *sarpas*, and multi-hooded ones are *Nāgas*.

“नागा बहुफणास्सर्पाः” \(*Śrī Rāmānujācārya* in the *Gītābhāshya* and *Śrī Vidyādhirāja* and *Śrī Tīrtha* in their commentary on the *Rāmāyaṇa*.\)

4\) The ones in the form of human beings possessing hood and tails are *Nāgas* and the rest are *Sarpas* \(optional meaning stated by *Śrītīrtha* in the *Rāmāyaṇa*\)

5\) Those which are not poisonous are *Nāgas* and the poisonous ones are *sarpas* \(*Śrīdharīya*\).

6\) *Takshaka* and others who live in *mahātala* are *sarpas, vāsuki* and others who dwell in *pātāḷa* are *nāgas*.

अधस्तान्महातले काद्रवेयाणां सर्पाणां नैकशिरसां क्रोधवशो नाम गणः, कुहकतक्षककालीयसुषेणादिप्रधाना महाभोगवन्तः ।

अधस्तात्पाताले नागलोकपतयः वासुकिप्रमुखाः शङ्ख, कुलिक, महाशङ्ख, श्वेत, धनञ्जय, धृतराष्ट्र, शङ्खचूड, कम्बलाश्वतर, देवदत्तादयो महाभोगिनः \(भाग 5-24-28, 30\)

7\) Among the great *Nāgas, Ananta* is preeminent and among *sarpas* it is *Vāsuki* \(*Śrī Śankarācārya*\)

8\) Snakes with a white complexion are *nāgas*. Snakes with red and other complexions are *sarpas*. “फणिनो धवलाङ्गा ये ते नागा इति कीर्तिताः । अन्ये रक्तादिवर्णाद्यैः बोध्याः सर्पादिनामभिः”

9\) Sons of *surasā* are *nāgas* and *kadru*’s sons are sarpas.

“सुरसाऽजनयन्नागान् राम कद्रूश्च पन्नगान्”\(रामायण III-14-30\) 

10\) There are some *śāstravākyas* also which have an opposite view of the above categorization, and which have used the words *Nāga* and *sarpa* synonymously.

सर्पाणां सुरसा जज्ञे शतं नैकशिरोभृताम्  
> स च घोरविषो नागः तक्षकश्चोपलक्षकः  
> नागानां वासुकिं चक्रे सर्पाणामथ तक्षकम्  
> नागाधिपं वासुकिमुग्रवीर्यं सर्पाधिपं तक्षकमादिदेश ॥  
\(लिङ्ग. महापपुराण 1-18-1\) 

		
After examining the above opinions and the *Yogaśāstras*, we would like to state that all the *sarpas* and *nāgas* which are enjoined for worship in the *Śruti, Smṛti, Purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* are exclusive distinct deities. They are not the serpents seen around.

Distinguished *Nāgas* are also distinguished deities. They have forms of both the humans and *nāga sarpas*. They are *kāmarūpis* \(can assume any form at their will\) Among them, those who dwell in *pātālasthāna* \(nether worlds\) with a brilliant white complexion are *nāgas* like *ananta*, *Vāsuki* and others. They have *Sattvaguṇa* predominant in them and are friends of *garutmān*. The ones which dwell in the *mahātalasthāna* effulgently such as *Takshaka, kuhaka* etc are of reddish complexion. They have *rajoguṇa* and *tamoguṇa* predominent in them and are afraid of *garutmān*. They can cause no harm to those who are blessed by *garutmān*. They create hurdles in the path of *yoga*. They are prayed not to cause any such hurdles.

Distinguished *nāgas* like *Ananta* and others bless the worshippers with health, wealth and upward progress in *Yoga*. They protect their devotees.

Thus, different categories of *Nāgas* are worshipped on *Nāgapañcamī*, *śrāvaṇa Pūrṇimā* and *Śukla Shashṭhī* of the month of *Pushya* and other special *parvas*. On the occasions of wearing \(*yajnopavīta*\) and *pratisāra* etc also, *Nāgas* belonging to these diverse categories are worshipped.





	 
## Narasimha Jayantī

### Importance of this *Parva*:

*Narasimha jayantī* is a prominent *parva* that comes after *akshaya tṛtīya* in the month of *vaiśākha*. To fecilitate the devotees to have the experience of the glory of one of the important incarnations of *Mahāvishṇu*, the great sages of *Sanātana Arya Bhārata* who were *jnānavijnāna tṛptātmas* have marked this as a nodal day in the body \(form\) of the almighty in the form of time. It is a great day which is auspicious, holy and the day which reminds \(us\) of the all pervasivenss and unequalled *jnāna, bala, aiśvarya, śakti, vīrya, tejas* and the motherly affection and love of that God towards devotees. It is a day in which the rituals are performed with great devotion in all the places in India where the *Upāsana* of *Vishṇu* and especially of Lord *Narasimha* is in vogue in the homes of devotees, who worship Lord *Narasimha* as either their family deity or a tutelary deity, and in *maṭhas, āshramas* and in temples. It is the day when his *upāsana* is taken up with austereness, both with the fear that any *apacāra* \(an offence\) to God may chance, and with devotion combined with great and full confidence that he will receive the *upacāras* with great affection. Some *Śaivas* also worship Lord *Narasimha* on that day.

### Detailed description of the name of the festival

This festival is also called by the name *Nṛsimhacaturdaśī* or *Narasimha caturdaśī*. The term *Nṛsimha jayantī* \(*Narasimha jayantī*\) connotes that, being the day of the incarnation of Lord *Narasimha*, it is also a day of special potential which provides success and *puṇya* to the devotees.

“जयं पुण्यं च तनुते जयन्तीं तेन तां विदुः” 

The second name \(i.e. *Narasimhacaturdaśī*\) like the name *Rāmanavamī*, indicates the *tithi* earmarked for the observation of this festival.

### Various opinions on the reigning deity:

As done in the case of the other *parvas*, it is appropriate to discuss the time, modalities and science etc. pertaining to this festival. But, before that, we shall take up the discussion about Lord *Narasimha*, the \(deity-in-worship\) of this festival. The conclusions obtained by such a discussion will help grasp other matters pertaining to the festival, in an easy and a satisfactory way.

Various views expressed by scholars belonging to different categories and levels being diverse and strange, invade our minds. They need to be examined with discernment. These opinions may be compiled as follows:

1. “We see a conjunct formtwo beings viz. the human being and the animal lion, in the *mūrti* of Lord *Narasimha*. This concept of man-lion deity occurred to Indians, by the study of an animal by name Griffin appearing in Greek mythology. Griffin is a bloodthirsty animal, with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. It’s body became the upper part of the body above the neck of *Narasimha*. Its head and the wings became the eagle *‘garuḍa’*, the vehicle of lord *Narasimha*. The fearful features and natures are common to both Griffin and *Narasimha*.

“When did the Indians get this not so valuable concept from the Greeks? It was after the conquest of India by Alexander. During that period, exchange of ideas between Indians and Greeks took place in the fields of knowledge and arts. Then, Indians took the concept of Griffin from the Greeks and making some modifications, conceived the deity of *Narasimha*. In the imagery of the field of Arts, Griffin and *Narasimha* are the antecedent and subsequent forms” − This is one opinion.

2. Earlier, the word *Narasimha* meant just “The best of men”. Though the word *Simha* means a distinguished animal, in usage it stands for the meaning ‘best’, at the end of a compound. \(*Narah Simha Iva = Narasimhah-upamita Samāsa*\) Even the lexicons say that words *Simha, śārdūla, Nāga, Vyāghra* etc. appearing at the latter part of a compound denoting a man, convey the meaning ‘best’ only.

> \(‘स्युरुत्तरपदे व्याघ्‌रअपुङ्गवर्षभकुञ्जराः ।  
सिंह्म्शार्दूल नागाद्याः पुंसि श्रेष्ठार्थगोचराः’ अमरकोश III-59\)  
“आश्रमं तु तयोः शून्यं प्रविश्य नरसिंह्म्योः” \(वाल्मीकिरामायण, सुन्दर 21-31\) 

Thus, either overlooking the well known figurative meaning viz. ‘the best’ for the word *Simha*, or to introduce an element of poetic charm, the word \(*Simha*\) was made here to mean the animal lion, and conceiving a deity consisting of a man-animal form, Indians weaved a mythological story accordingly \(see the book “The man-lion” by B. Narayana Iyengar\). This change must have taken place in the post Christian era. There are several instances which go to show that Indians are experts in creating \(such new godheads\) \(Please refer to *Śaivadharma of* Dr. *Yaduvīra*.\) The famous mythological word *‘Śikhīvāhana’* is a clear example of this. *Shaṇmukha* is the son of *Rudra* i.e. the son of *Agni*. As *Agni* has flames, it is called *Śikhī*. Since the peacock has *sikha* \(i.e. a plume on it’s head\) it is also called *Śikhī* in *Sanskrit*. *Shaṇmukha* was called *Śikhivāhana* as he was being carried by *Śikhī* \(*Agni*\), his father. So, a new strange meaning for the word *Śikhivāhana* viz. the one whose vehicle is a peacock was fabricated subsequently. Later, this meaning itself became famous and the principal meaning. i.e. the son of *Agni*, faded out. The portrait of *Shaṇmukha* riding a peacock flourished widely in *Purāṇas*, literature and Arts, \(and fine arts\). Thus, by the power of double entendre, the peacock became the vehicle of *Shaṇmukha*, and similarly by the power of the association of the meaning of the word *Simha*, the animal *Simha* became the part of the body of the form of *Narasimha*.

There are some ‘great’ men who in their explanation of the concept of *‘Daśāvatāra’* on the lines of the evolution theory propounded by modern scientists, interpret the incarnation of *Narasimha* also. According to them, fish, the aquatic animal is the earliest animal in evolution. So *matsyāvātāra* was declared as the first incarnation. The tortoise, an amphibian, being the animal of the second stage in the evolution, led to the imagination of *‘Kūrma Avatāra’*. The *Varāhāvatāra* took place next, which has a face of a boar a ferocious animal, \(which is\) more evolved. Thereafter, the *Narasimhāvatāra* took place, with the face of a lion which is the king of the forest and a superior animal vis-a-vis the boar. In these \(*avatāras*\) the features of both humans and animals are blended. The *Vāmanāvatāra* which has purely a human form, displays a much higher evolution. With the progress of evolution, many *avatāras* such as of *Paraśurāma, Śrī Rāma, Śrī Kṛshṇa*, and at the end, the *Buddha*, the ultimate in evolution, took place. Among these, the middle state of the features of man-boar nature and *Vāmana*-man-nature is the origin for the concept of *Narasimhvatāra.* This is the argument of some scholars.

4\). Some critics say “Earlier, the *Vaishṇavas* used to worship only dieties with a pleasing form and who were merciful. Whereas, worshipping of deities such as *Vīrabhadra*, *Bhairava* and others with frightful forms and acts, was in vogue among *Śaivas*, and such deities became dear to a section of them \(*Vaishṇavas*\). In order to attract such people, *Vaishṇavas* also conceived a fierce looking god engaged in ferocious acts. That deity itself is *Narasimha*.”

5\). In the wordly parlance, the expression ‘The *Narasimhāvatāra* has arrived’ means someone is overcome with uncontrollable anger and is also in a spell of invincible and ferocious prowess. For example several years ago, a person in our village used to chase during night time whomever he saw, with a loud cry.—“I am under the spell of *Māramma*,” and used to chase people and beat them up. Seeing this, when another person started chasing him with a stick in his hand and yelling—“I am under the spell of god *Narasimha”*, within no time, the person in the ‘spell’ of *Māramma* fled\! Bot these were dramas\! But this incident goes to show that the word *Narasimha* has come to mean only something very ferocious in the mind of people.

The worship of these terrifying forms is called *‘Raudradhyāna’*. People who practice it are bound to meet with the evil fate of those who indulge in such ferocious acts. But those who meditate upon nonviolent and benign images, obtain peaceful nature and salvation as the result of that peace \(full nature\). This conforms to the axim of the *Mimamsakas* viz *“Tatkratu nyāya”* which states that “a person reaps the fruits there, which match his *upāsana* here.”

And there are some who, displaying their cleverness in wild conjectures, say-“But people were not ready to give up the worship of *Narasimha* \(though identified\) with the features of ferociousness and beastly culture, as the worship was in their tradition. So the words *Lakshmī, Bhoga, Yoga, Saumya, Śānta* etc were associated \(with *NaraSimha*\) and accordingly, some changes were effected in the image of the deity, it’s form and retinue, and the custom of worshipping \(*Narasimha* in the new form\) came into vogue”.

6\). “The episode of *Narasimhāvatāra* is not a vestige of any beastly culture. It is a divine story which proclaims how the extraordinary strength lying latent in people expresses itself at the right time. It is a beautiful metaphor. *Hiraṇyakaśipu* represents cruel tyranny and an unbearable autocracy. People somehow do put up with such a reign for some time. But, at the end, the lion-power, latent in the people, manifests all of a sudden and surely destroys that autocracy. The leader of the mass who instigates the lion power is *Prahlāda*.”—This is the explanation \(interpretation\) of the mystery of *Narasimhavatāra* given by some scholars. \(Please see the English poem *‘Prahlāda’* by Torudatt\).

7\). Some others provide a spiritual commentary as follows: “The story of the incarnation of *Narasimha* is not a metaphor to teach ethics to the world. It is an allegory woven by sages to teach spirituality. In that \(allegory\) *Hiraṇyakaśipu* means ignorance. *Narasimha* is indeed the *Mahāguru* who tears the knots of the \(inner\) heart, and here he has done it in the form of tearing open the chest of *Hiraṇyakaśipu*.”

Another commentary with the same view point is like this: “We see the seed of the story of incarnation of *Narasimha* in the vedic literature itself. A line in *Atharvaveda* says When there is conflict between *Dharma* and *adharma* a lightning strikes between them instantly. In this story *Prahlāda* stands for *Dharma* that is steady, and *Hiraṇyakaśipu* stands for *adharma* that does not move from its place. When a clash ensued between them, the lightning which instantly struck is the effulgent *Narasimha* which is the *paratattva*“. This is a commentary which spells out a very lofty \(philosophical\) principle.

In these explanations we see the following purport—“The story of the incarnation of *Narasimha* is just a metaphor of symbols, and of ethics and principles, and not a narration of the actual events that occurred. Even the form of *Narasimha* is only an imagination.”

8\). There are some who interpret that the incarnation of *Narasimha* was an event that actually took place and there is no metaphor of any kind in it.

9\). Many works such as the *Mahābhārata*, *Harivamśa*, *Vishṇupurāṇa*, *Narasimha purāṇa*, *Śrīmadbhāgavata*, *Śivapurāṇa* etc describe the incarnation of *Narasimha*. Though some descriptions are common in \(those works\), there is no unanimity in all the topics. Which among them is reliable? And which is not?—These are the doubts that arise.

\(These are some of the interpretations of critics pertaining to *Narasimhāvatāra*\) Let us now study what is said about his form and incarnation in the *śāstras* of *Sanātana Aryabhārata Maharshis*.

*Śrī Narasimha* is an incarnation of Lord *Vishṇu*. All our spiritual texts, *Itihāsas* and *purāṇas* tell that his incarnation is the fifth among the famous ten *avatāras* of *Vishṇu*. The *Narasimhagāyatrīmantra* appearing in the Andhra version of the *Mahānārāyaṇopanishad* meditates upon him as a \(god\) with \(diamond like\) hard claws, sharp pointed teeth, and, as Lord *Narasimha* and prays to incite our intellect वज्रनाखाय विद्महे तीक्ष्णदग्ग्ंष्ट्राय धीमहि । तन्नो नारसिग्ंहः प्रचोदयात् ॥

*Nṛsimhatāpini upanishad*, which is categorized as belonging to *Atharvaveda*, has quoted *Nṛsimha mantra* along with the *Ṛshi*, deity and metre and describes him as *“kshīrasāgaraśāyī*, the goal of *yogis, Parampada, ṛta, Satya, Parambrahma, Purusha, Kṛshṇapiṅgala, Ūrdhvareta, Virūpāksha* etc.

\(“क्षीरोदार्णवशायिनं नृकेसरिविग्रहं योगिध्येयं परम्पदम् ।” “ऋतं सत्यं परब्रह्म पुरुषं कृष्णपिङ्गलम् । ऊर्ध्वरेतं विरूपाक्षं शङ्क,अरं नीललोहितम् ॥”\) It associates him with the *mantras* of *Vishṇusūkta, Mahānārāyaṇīya* and *Taittirīyopanishad* and proclaims his glory, and also states the *Phalaśruti* of this *Upanishad*.

The *StotraPūjakalpa* prescribing his *Divyamaṅgalavigraha* for meditation says “He is the Trinity and *Parabrahmasvarūpi,* He has the form of *Brahma* upto the navel, form of *Vishṇu* upto the neck, and form of *Rudra* upto the head. Above that, the form of *Śiva* \(*Parabrahma*\) on the whole.

“आनाभि ब्रह्मणो रूपं आगलाद्वैषणवं वपुः ।”  
“आशीर्षं रुद्रमीशानं तदूर्ध्वं सर्वतः शिवः ॥” 

*Śrīmadbhāgavata* is the most popular work among the ones which describe the incarnation of *Narasimha*. We briefly narrate here the story appearing in that. Having that at the centre, we may focus only on those parts \(in the story\) which appear differently in the famous *itihāsas* and *purāṇas*.

*“Jaya* and *Vijaya*, the gate keepers of *Vaikunṭha* who offended the sages *Sanaka* and others, on being cursed by them were born as demons. They were born as *Hiraṇyāksha* and *Hiraṇyakaśipu* in their first birth. *Mahāvishṇu* in his *avatāra* of *Varāha* killed *Hiraṇyāksha*. Enraged by this, *Hiraṇyakaśipu* began hating *Mahāvishṇu* and started cruelly torturing the devotees of God, pious people and *devas*. He performed severe penance addressing Lord *Brahma*, and obtained a boon as follows: “Let there be no death to me either from humans, animals, gods, demons, serpents or any animal created by *Brahma*, either during night or day, either on earth or in the sky, either inside or outside a house. I should have suzerainty over everyone.”

Puffed up with pride by the boon, he became a thorn to the world. Unable to bear his harassment, the *devas* beseeched the almighty \(Lord *Vishṇu*\). And he assured them protection by stating that he himself will kill the demon in course of time.

*Prahlāda* the son of *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, was a *Paramabhāgavatottama,* right from his birth. As per the orders of the king, the disciples of *Śukrācārya* taught him the philosophy of the demons. But he did not like those lessons. Once his father lovingly took him on his lap and asked − My child\! Tell me the quintessence of what you have learnt’. The child naturally answered. ‘Devotion to *Vishṇu* is the means of highest good’. In the beginning this was taken as amusement by the father. Some time later also, *Prahlāda* said that worshipping of *Nārāyaṇa* through *Navavidhabhakti* is the supreme deed.

> श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्   
> अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम् ।  
> इति पुंसार्पिता विष्णौ भकिश्चेन्नवलक्षणा ॥ \(भागवत-स्कन्ध VII5-23\) 

And with this reply *Hiraṇyakaśipu* became enraged beyond bounds. He took the teachers of *Prahlāda* to task. But *Prahlāda* appealed that they did not teach him the above philosophy and that it has naturally occurred to him by the grace of the supreme entity. The anger of the demon king knew no bounds. He ordered his demon soldiers. − “Even though a limb happens to be a part of the body, it should be severed if daubed with poison. So, this rascal should be killed, even though he is my son.” Accordingly, they subjected him to various atrocities such as piercing him with weapons like spear, poisoning by snakes, trampling by elephants, acts of black magic, dropping from mountain top etc. But the boy was unscathed by any of these as he was always immersed in meditation of God and was being protected by him. \(Not just that\). He started teaching his philosophy to the demon boys also, who were his classmates.

Now *Hiraṇyakaśipu* felt that he had no other option than to kill *Prahlāda* by his own hands. He summoned him to the assembly at the time of the evening twilight. Brandishing his sword in front of the boy he roared—“Where is your omnipresent *Vishṇu”*? Why is he not seen in this pillar? If you do not show him here, “I will decapitate you”. And he banged a pillar nearby by his fist. Immediately a terrifying roar was heard from the pillar. A marvelous form that was neither completely human nor completely of an animal, but \(a fusion of\) both, came out of the pillar. A terrifying form it was, gigantic in shape , and reaching the heavens; with dreadful fangs, and a protruded tongue that was sharp like the edge of a sword, with dishevelled manes and with diamond hard claws. It manifested with a ferocious laughter.

> सत्यं विधातुं निजभृत्यभाषितम् व्याप्तिं च भूतेष्वखिलेषु चात्मनः ।  
> अदृश्यतात्यद्भुतरूपमुद्वहन् स्तम्भे सभायां न मृगं न मानुषम् ॥ 

*Hiraṇyakaśipu* who went to attack him met with the fate of a moth rushing towards fire. Like a *Garuḍa* catching a snake, *Narasimha* effortlessly caught hold of *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, and sitting on the region of the entry door of the assembly, he tore open his chest, and garlanding himself with his intestines, furiously roared again and again. Other demons who came to attack him were also destroyed. Greatly rejoicing at this, gods showered flowers and danced. They praised the Lord in various ways. But no one dared to go near that fierce form to pacify him. Then at the instance of Lord *Brahma*, child *Prahlāda* the supreme devotee, fearlessly came near the Lord and prostrated. The Lord took him on his lap with affection and placing his protecting right hand on the child’s head, conferred supreme blessings.* Prahlāda* with his voice choked with devotion praised the Lord of Lords. Though lured by the Lord himself, the supreme devotee did not ask \(for\) any boons .When pressed further by the Lord, he only prayed “May the sins of my father be absolved. May he \(obtain\) deliverance” The Lord commanded “It has been already arranged. Seven generations of your lineage have been reemed. They are blessed with deliverance. \(Now\) You get crowned as the king in your father’s place. In the framework of supreme devotion, perform deeds that propitiate me and in the end you may come to me”. And then blessing *“Brahma* and other deities he disappeared.”

The story appering in *Vishṇupurāṇa* also is very much akin to this. There, *Hiraṇyakaśipu* embraces son *Prahlāda* with love combined with repentance, after he \(*Prahlāda*\) comes out safe from perils like the poisonous snake bite etc. *Prahlāda* also pleases his father by serving him. But there are no details which state under what circumstance *Hiraṇyakaśipu* was slain by Lord *Narasimha*.

According to *Harivamśa Purāṇa, Mahavishṇu* enters the \(court\) of *Hiraṇyakaśipu* taking the help of only *praṇava*. All the demons are astonished on seeing it and ask themselves “What is this strange figure?” Only *Prahlāda* recognizes it with divine vision, that it is God. He tells the demons that the whole cosmos is hidden in that divine body. Then *Narasimha* kills *Hiraṇyakaśipu* and other demons who provoke him. After being praised by the *devas*, he proceeds to the northern shore of the ocean of milk and installs his man lion body there, and assuming his previous form of *Vishṇu*, returns to his abode.

> “क्षीरोदस्योत्तरं कूलं जगाम प्रभुरीश्वरः ।  
> नारसिंहीं तनूं त्यक्त्वा स्थापयित्वा च तद्वपुः ।  
> पौराणं रूपमास्थाय ययौ स गरुडध्वजः ॥ \(हरिवंश-21\) 

Even though there are a few significant aspects in this *Purāṇa*, the incidents of *Hiraṇyakaśipu* tormenting *Prahlāda* in bizarre ways do not figure at all in this *Purāṇa*.

*Śrīmanmahābhārata* which is renowned as *“pañcamaveda”*, *“Smrti”, Ithihāsottama* and *“purāṇapūrnacandra”* depicts the story of *Nrisihmāvatāra* briefly in the thirtyeigth chapter of the *sabhāparva*. But the story of *Prahlāda* does not appear there. The rest of the story is on the lines of the story in *Śrīmadbhāgavata*. In *NaraSimhapurāṇa*, a minor *purāṇa*, the story of *Narasimha* is expounded largely on the lines of *Śrīmadbhāgavata* and *Vishṇupurāṇa*. Now we shall observe a few significant points here.

1. This *purāṇa* quotes here, a humorous and a strange incident when the Lord killed *Hiraṇyakaśipu*. When Lord *Narasimha* ripped open *Hiraṇyakaśipu’s* heart in a maddening fury , the two halves of the body get embedded into the slits between the fingers and the claws of the Lord. The Lord was surprised when the dead body was not to be seen and got worried and said. “Where did this brute go?” Has he escaped? Then my exploit has gone in vain\!” Then he shook his hands vigorously. Immediately the two halves of the body of *Hiraṇyakaśipu* fell off from the interstice of his claws like particles of dust” − This is the interesting description given there.

> शकले द्वे तिरोभूते नखरन्ध्रे महात्मनः ।  
> ततः क्व यातो दुष्टोसाविति देवोतिविस्मितः ॥ 

> निरीक्ष्य सर्वतो राजन् वृथैतत्कर्म मेभवत् ।  
> इति सैन्त्य राजेन्द्र नरसिह्मो महाबलः ॥ 

व्यधूनयत्करावुच्चैस्तस्ते शकले नृप।  
> नखरन्ध्रन्निपतिते भूमौ रेणुसमे हरेः” ॥ \(अध्याय 44, श्लॊ, 32-34\) 

2. After blessing *Prahlāda*, Lord *Narasimha*, being worshipped by gods, has gone to the summit of *Śrīśaila* and stays there to bless his devotees and to destroy those who are non-devotees.

> श्रीशैलशिखरं प्राप्य विश्रुतः सुरपूजितः ।  
> स्थितो भक्तहितार्थाय अभक्तानां क्षयाय च ॥” \(अ. 44, श्लॊ.39\) 

Though there are slight differences in the narration of the story, *Śrīmadbhāgavata*, *Vishṇupurāṇa*, *Harivamśa*, *Mahābhārata* and *Narasimha purāṇa* state the purport that Lord *Narasimha* is *Parātpara Parabrahman*, the remover of the perils of the world, the protector of the devotees, the unconquerable and the possessor of invincible prowess.

We also see some works in our tradition, which depict Lord *Narasimha* as an ordinary god, arrogant, haughty and the one subjugated by lord *Rudra*.

For example, in the recently available *Śātarudrasamhitā* of the *Śiva-purāṇa* version, we find the rendering as follows:-“After killing *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, *Narasimha* became very arrogant and went on destroying the world by his prowess and haughtiness. Then *Vīrabhadra*, on the orders of Lord *Śiva* approached him and tried to appease him but to no avail. *Narasimha* attacked that *Vīrabhadra* himself.

On the orders of *Śiva, Vīrabhadra* manifested himself the form of a ferocious *śarabha* \(an eight legged animal stronger than a lion\). The moment he saw that form, Narasimha became deprived of his effulegene and strength, like a glow worm in front of the sun. *Śarabha* did not leave him at that. He took him captive, beat him up, lifted him to the sky, tore his body and presented the corpse to *Śiva*. Lord *Śiva* used *Narasimha’s* skin as his garment, and added *Narasimha’s* head to his garland of skulls. *Narasimha* punished *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, and in turn *Rudra* punished *Narasimha* himself\!

> “हरिग्ं हरन्तमनुयन्ति देवाः ।  
> विश्वस्येशानं वृषभं मतीनाम् 

> अथ विभ्रम्य पक्षाभ्यां नाभिपादान्विदारयन् ।  
> पादान्बबन्ध पुच्छेन बाहुभ्यां बाहुमण्डलम् ॥

> तद्वक्त्रं मुण्डमालायां नायकत्वेन कल्पितम् ”॥ अध्याय 12, श्लॊ 12.... .36\) 

We come across some sentences in *Śarabhopanishad*, a work of recent origin, which goes to state that *Śiva* not only killed *Narasimha* but also killed the other incarnations of *Vishṇu* as well i.e., *Matsya*, *Kūrma*, *Varāha* and *Trivikrama* and, wore their body parts on his body.

“यो घोरं वेषमास्थाय शरभाख्यं महेश्वरः ।  
> नृसिंहं लोकहन्तारं सञ्जघान महाबलः ॥ 

यो मत्स्यकूर्मादिवराहसिह्मान् ।  
> विष्णुं क्रमन्तं वामनमादिविष्णुम् ॥  
> विविक्लबं पीड्यमानं जघान” 

There is a *mantra* by name *mṛuthyusūkta* in the *Anuvāka* 315, of *Kṛshṇayajurveda Taittirīyāraṇyaka praśna*. Some *Raudravīras* \(heroic devotees of *Rudra*\) interpret it to mean that *Rudra* subdued *Vishṇu*.

> हरिग्ं हरन्तमनुयन्ति देवाः ।  
> विश्वस्येशानं वृषभं मतीनाम् 

\(The translation of the *mantra* according to these people is − “gods follow *Rudra* the lord of the universe, the ultimate of deities, and the one who slew *Narasimha*.”\)

The *Vaishṇavavīras* reject the above story which is narrated by *Raudraviras*, as a statement of a *tāmasa purāṇa*. Also, they quote a sentence from a work called *Vishṇurahasya* which gives the meaning that *Vishṇu* incarnated as *Ganḍabherunḍa* \(mythical bird with two heads\) and killed the *Śarabha* incarnation of *Rudra*. Not just that. They interpret the above said first *Ṛk* from *mrutyusūkta* to mean that gods follow *Hari* who is the lord of the universe, the supreme deity and the slayer of *Rudra*.

The *Raudravīras* continue the story—“Then *Kālī* who took birth from the forehead of *Śarabha* devoured *Vishṇu* who had incarnated as *Ganḍabherunḍa”*.

We come across many poetic works and religious texts that are composed based on the purport of the above stories, by heroic devotees of recent times.

Leave alone the matter of real *Vishṇu* and *Rudra*\! The gods *Vishṇu* and *Rudra* fancied in the minds of these *Vīrabhaktas*, forgetting their work of protecting the world and destruction of the wicked. \(to the world\) demons and *daityas*, have instead engaged themselves in destroying each other. A surprise indeed\! If the statements of these two categories of *Vīrabhaktas* are true, then both *Vishṇu* and *Rudra* have already slain each other. That is why they are not to be found anywhere in the world\! It is a tough thing to decide which statement of the above said scriptural works in the continued tradition is authentic and which is not? We do not opine that all that is ancient is correct and all that is new is erroneous. But, at a time when it was believed that all that is ancient is authentic, many have indulged in composing *ślokas* and prose pieces that serve their views and have inscribed and inserted them in the manuscripts of *Śruti, smṛti, purāṇas, itihāsas* etc. written either on palm leaves or birch leaves, and have tried to fetch respectability of ancientness to them. These parts of texts that have been added like that are called interpolations. Ancient texts that are free from such interpolations have become rare now-a-days.

It may be easy to clearly filter such interpolations by observing a change in style in some places, contradictory opinions, and statements contradicting historical evidence etc. But there are some interpolated parts, that have been added with great cleverness, and beyond the above detectable differences. These can be separated only with the help of self-realized great souls who are *jnānavijnānatṛptātmas* and who have visualized the ultimate truth. Without that help, writings aimed at mutual mud-slinging caused by intellectual outery, and tumult of passion and enmity throwing dirt at each other have come up in large numbers in our country, and have tresspassed their way into all areas such as *Upanishads*, *smṛti, itihāsa, purāṇas* etc. If people read those works without filtering the interpolations \(from the original\) they may tend to think.—“All these religious texts are full of contradictions. All these are webs of imaginations. They are compositions written from time to time to advocate the importance of the gods imagined by them. None of these are trustworthy. Let us leave this Hindu religion which worships many gods and instead, resort to some modern religion, which advocates oneness of god, or else, let us cling to atheism which states that there is no god or godmen” But it will be wise to give up these feelings, and take to the path of truth established by rationality and experience. We have to accept the truth in the matter of Lord *NaraSimha*, after examining on that touchstone the views of the moderns also.

“One text says that Rudra incarnated as Śarabha tore open Narasimha. Another says that Vishṇu incarnated as Ganḍabherunḍa tore open Rudra. Which of the two is true? We cannot decide the truth by mere persistence. The truth has to be found out from those gods themselves. Books of truth adorn the hands of both Śrī Hayagrīva, the knowledge form of Mahāvishṇu and Dakshiṇāmūrtī the Sadaśiva. Truth emerges only when those books are read directly. The minds of the wise also takes that path”ṝThese are the guiding words of Śrī Raṅgamahāguru pertaining to this, which we respectfully wish to recall here, and we wish to continue the discussion on truth and myth.

No prejudice should be entertained when this discussion is taken up.

1. No blind belief such as “all the opinions in ancient texts are correct and all the opinions of moderns are wrong, should be entertained. \(पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्\)

2. The supersitition that all that is said by moderns is acceptable because they have a highly evolved intellect, the opinion of the ancient days have emerged when the intellect was not well evolved, and they are not fit for acceptance, has \(also\) to be given up “नवीनमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्”

3. Even if our wisdom tells us that the opinions of ancients are wrong, we should not give them up. Blind devotion born out of pride, as evident from the feelings like “This is the banyan tree planted by my father. Somehow it has to be protected”, should also be given up.

4. When it occurs to our mind that some of the opinions of the moderns are not correct, or that they are still controversial, a thought may come to our mind viz. “People may call us bigots. And may accuse us as persons with vested interests. Or our popularity may fade. So it is better to somehow substantiate the view of the moderns”-This fear— complex or hesitation has also to be shed.

Without being influenced by feelings, honor or fear, truth should be placed before the seekers of *satya* with honesty and boldness. With the intention of facilitating the entry of discernment in the minds of the readers, we shall present our opinions in the question-answer format hereby.

Question no 1. Some modern scholars argue that the Greeks had the concept of Griffin, a deity with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle. Influenced by this, *Bhāratīyas* conceived the image of *NaraSimha* who had the head of a lion and the body resembling humans. Which of these is true?

Answer: This question has two parts. One, that *NaraSimha* is a mere imagination. Two, that the concept is the gift of the Greeks.

To think that *Narasimha* is an imagination, is itself an imagination. In time honoured literature, no-where is he referred to by scholars as an imaginary form.

Secondly, There is no unambiguous evidence to draw this opinion that *Bhāratīyas* were inspired by Greeks. Some may say—“Greeks who came to *Bhārata* saw the idols of God *Narasimha*. They could not understand the mystery of the idol. Why can’t it be that they happened to conceive the deity Griffin, by imitating a little, the external form of *Narasimha* and adding some imagination of their own to it?” Some people may question. In actuality, the similarity between the idols of *Narasimha* and the Greek deity Griffin is very little. It is not even necessary to guess that they have been inspired by each other. Both are independent subject matters which have manifested independently in their respective intellectual realms. *Narasimha* is the form who can be truly experienced in the suprasensory state, and who was visualized by the \(spiritually\) refined souls who remained in the discipline of yogic science: \(that form\) is being visualized \(even now\) and can be visualized always \(and in future also\) by such souls. Presently, no records are available in Greek mythology to tell that deities like Griffin etc. happen to be universal truths perceived in the yogic state. If modern scholars interpolate *Ashṭāṅgayoga* in Greek works and try to establish that \(Greek\) deities are also the visions in the yogic state, they alone will be responsible for that. Akin to interpolations done in our ancient texts in the middle age, neoteric persons may interpolate Greek mythology also and fetch fame. But, that wont be a result of an honest enquiry.

Question 2: Some have explained the ten *avatāras* of *Vishṇu* on the lines of the evolution theory.

The first incarnation is a creature which lives only in water i.e. the fish. The second one is the incarnation of the tortoise which lives both on land and in water, i.e. the *Kūrmāvatāra.* The third is *Varāhāvatāra* which is a much stronger one than the tortoise and a fusion of the head of a boar \(wild boar\) and the human body. Then comes the *Narasimhāvatāra*, that has the head of a lion which is stronger than the boar and the body of a man. The fifth one is *Vāmanāvatāra* a form of a dwarf. Then come the progressive and superiorly evolved incarnations in the human form. As per the evolution theory, the *Narasimhāvatāra*, appearing between *Varāha* and *Vāmana* in the incarnation series, brings out the animal-man culture that appears between a cruel animal and a human being, represented by the boar-man nature and the bare-man nature. Is this argument correct? This is the question.

Answer: This line of argument is not correct. Because, there is a state called *Parāprakṛti* which is beyond the meritorious nature of the deities, which, in turn, is beyond human nature which is an admixture of *puṇya* and *pāpa*, and \(the *Parāprakṛti*\) is above the beastly and demoniacal dispositions. As is evident from the statement ‘प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम्” of the Lord in the *Bhagavadgīta*, Lord *Narasimha* is related to the *parā prakṛti*.

He possesses a form which surpasses the universe and can be visualized only in the state of *Parāprakṛt*i which is described as supreme in the statement— ‘स्थूलं परं चेति त्रिविधं ब्रह्मणो वपुः’ Those who describe him, who is a form of *Parāprakriti,* as a representative of the fusion of the dispositions of a great animal and a human being, do so as per their own nature and \(obviously\) have not described it after climbing to the state of *Parāprakṛti* which is natural to *Narasimha*. Their commentary may touch only the *Prākṛta Narasimha* of their own imagination, and does not at all touch the form of the true *Narasimha* who is *Aprākṛta* or the Lord of *ParāPrakṛti*, as expounded by *jnānis*.

Question 3.The argument that the story of *Narasimha* is an allegory which tells a worldly truth that, humanity indeed exists and it destroys autocracy and oppression after tolerating it for a long time, and the argument that it is again an allegory which proclaims the spiritual truth that a *jnāni* tears apart the core of *ajnāna*. Do these arguments stand to reason?

Answer: We do appreciate this moral and the spiritual truth. But it is not necessary to whimsically drag the story of *Narasimha* to those areas, to drive home the intended moral or principles, as it is done either literally or suggestively by many *upākhyānas* such as *Vena*’s story, *purañjanopākhyāna* etc. in our *itihāsas* and *purāṇas*. Looking into these \(substories\) one can satisfy for himself the thirst for literary aesthetic experience. There is no internal or external evidence to show that Lord *Narasimha’s* story is didactic alleogory.

Question 4: “Earlier the word *Narasimha* was used only in the sense of the best among men. After sometime, the main meaning ‘king of animals’ for the word *‘simha’* there, was wrongly imposed and the story of *Narasimha* was woven by the ancients“—Is not this argument beautiful?

Answer: The flower of this argument looks attractive from a distance, but when approached and seen, it will be found out that there is neither the fragrance nor the tenderness nor the sweet nectar. It does also not develop into a fruit. It is true that these *Vādisimhas* \(lion like debators\) possess the knowledge of the literal meaning and the figurative meaning of the word *simha* in Sanskrit. But we wish to state that these debators have only woven an imagined story out of false prestige, and also with the impression that the great writers of *Itihāsa* and *Purāṇa* didn’t have as much knowledge of *Sanskrit* as they \(the debators\) possess, and so have woven a story by mistaking the word *simha* in the word *Narasimha*, to stand for a distinct animal. Why should they \(the debators\) fancy that the great sages didn’t have the elegance and poetic talent to suitably use the word *simha* in the sense of either a distinct animal or the best of men?

Question 5: How can one get peace by meditating on the ferocious form of *Narasimha*? Worship of god is performed mainly for peace, isn’t it? Instead of meditating upon a benign beautiful form, why should one meditate upon this terrifying form?

Answer: It is not proper to think or swear that whatever appears terrifying for the mere eyes remains in the same terrifying form, in the state of *Samādhi* also. Only *jnānis* who have the experience of both the external vision and the inner vision during the state of deep meditation, will be \(able to give\) an honest explanation.* Jnānis* state that some forms of gods who may appear ferocious for the external eyes, appear extraordinarily beautiful when seen with the pure vision of *Dhyānasamādhi* in the backdrop of worship performed with devotion. It may be kindly noted that devotees who are *jnānasiddhas* have called Lord *Narasimha* as *Alahiya Śingar* \(*Celuva Narasimha*\) \(handsome *Narasimha*\) based on their experience.

This is a statement borne out of inner experience. In the external world also, when things are to be viewed aesthetically, the unique truth can be known only when it is done with discernment. Artists call either a person or an animal beautiful, only when they are in the natural state. Real beauty lies in being natural. A lion looks beautiful only if it is ferocious with thick manes. At the same time, a deer with fickle eye movements and with a face of a gentle animal, looks beautiful. This applies to humans also. So, if we expect human beauty in an animal or some other beauty of our liking, we become a laughing stock in aesthetics.

Question 6: What you say is indeed true in aesthetics. But all generally agree that the lion is a ferocious animal. A lion may appear beautiful to an other lion. But is it not a ferocious animal in the eyes of the humans? Isn’t it that something which looks ferocious to the external eyes, should be ferocious in the inner meditation also?

Answer: There is no such rule. Even in the physical world there will be no such fear or shyness during some attractions. When it is so, it won’t be correct to guess that there will always be fear even while one is happily roaming in the suprasensory world, which is beyond the worldly activities. After advancing a few steps in the spiritual path, there will be no room even for an iota of fear for a *Sādhaka*.

Question 7: How far does fear bother in meditation? After which point the grip of fear ceases?

Answer: ***Śrī Raṅgamahāguru*, the supreme *Yogi*, has stated that fear vanishes after one crosses the *Mahattattva* and moves upwards.** If there were to be fear even in *Dhyāna samādhi* how could child *Prahlāda* go near *Narasimha* fearlessly and prostrate before him, praise him and enjoy the supreme bliss?

Question 8: In that case, why did even gods get scared when they first saw *Narasimha*?

Answer: Even gods will be gripped by fear, if they do not get immersed in deep meditation in like *Prahlāda*.

Question 9: Have the sages stated anywhere that there will be no fear in *Dhyāna samādhi*?

Answer: The teachings of our Gurumahāraj who was a Samādhisiddha by experience, have been already narrated by us. If one is established in the blissful paramāt*man*, there will be no fear at all. *Taittirīya upanishad* clearly proclaims that even if a small deviation takes place in the continuous blissful experience of god, fear occurs.

> अभयं प्रतिष्ठां विन्दते । अथ सोभयं गतो भवति ।  
> यदा ह्येवैष एतस्मिन् उदरमन्तरं कुरुते अथ तस्य भयं भवति ॥ 

If Lord *Narasimha* were to appear ferocious to devotees, then even in *Dhyānasamādhi*, alarmed by visualizing Him directly, *Sādhakas* would flee to the streams of senses, giving up meditation.

One more thing has to be noted here. Śrī Raṅgamahāguru who knew the mystery of Māna and Meya used to say-“If at all the yardstick that is used to measure the objects in the world of senses \(i.e. the worldly objects\) is taken to measure \(the experience etc. of\) spirituality, it \(the yardstick\) will be shattered into pieces at the entry point itself.” This has to be always remembered.

Question no 10: Then, should we accept all that is stated in spiritual science without subjecting them to discernment?

Answer: We have not said so. They have to be necessarily examined. We have only stated that mere intelligence cannot be the yardstick for all the experiences of the spiritual field. But, even though the intellect of the physical world cannot be a full fledged measuring stick for the spiritual world, it can be useful as an *upamādaṇḍa* in many aspects. It has to be used appropriately for that work. Otherwise superstition will grow. The interpolations that have crept into the *śāstras* may become authentic\!

That is why *jnānis* insist that discernment should be in the parameters of *satya*, and what is arrived by that should be taken as a proven truth by experience and experiments.

2. In the description of Lord *Narasimha*, we come across statements such as “He is death to the death”, “one who helps us pass over death”, “the ordainer of the wheel of time.” etc.. We also see quotations in *śāstras*, that he is a divine incarnation of god who is described as “The one who makes the god of death run away on seeing him,” “the one who uses *brahmakshatras* as food and death as curry”, and, the one who swallows everything”.

> “मृत्युमृत्युं नमाम्यहम्” “मृत्युभीतिविनाशकः” “यदायत्तं जगच्चक्रं  
> कालचक्रं च शाश्वतम्” “मृत्युर्धावति पाम इति” 

> “यस्य ब्रह्म च क्षत्रं च उभे भवत ओदनः।  
> मृत्युर्यस्योपसेचनं क इत्था वेद कुत्र सः ॥” 

To state that such a god ‘met with death’ or ‘passed away’ amounts to an awful offence against truth indeed.

3. *Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Rudra* are authorized to carry out the duties of creation, sustenance and destruction \(of universe\) respectively. *Vishṇu* provides sustenance. The killing of demons who are thorns to the world, is also his regular work, as he is *‘Daityāri’* \(enemy of demons\). It is the work of *Rudra* to control the perilous demons at times, and to destroy the world during the great deluge. When such is the case, to state that, *Rudra* violating his limits, vanquished the sustaining god himself, is against the code of the Almighty. Again, to say—*“Śiva* probably endorsed the killing of *Hiraṇyakaśipu* by *Narasimha*. But after vanquishing him, *Narasimha* began to destroy the world itself. And therefore he was punished for that” − is also against truth. Because, it is the work of *Rudra* to destroy the world and he does it at the time of deluge. So, either *Vishṇu* doing *Śiva’s* work or carrying it out in the improper time, is an impossibility in the reign of God who is a *Satyakāma* and a *Satyasaṅkalpa.*

4. The *raudravīra*s continue their story saying that *Rudra* not only destroyed *Nārāyaṇa’s Narasimhāvatāra*, but also tore open his other incarnations viz *matsya*, *kūrma, varāha* and *trivikramamūrtī*. \(We have to note that\) all these incarnations are *upākhyānas* which are full of divine principles. *Matsyamūrtī* is the savior of the *vedas*. Even though he descends to the ocean of the world to liberate souls, he not only returns to his original form, but also takes the devotees along with him. He is a *Yogapurusha* who travels across both the banks of the ocean. *Kūrma* provided great help to *devas* during the great churning for ambrosia He stabilized the movement of *Meru* the Mountain used as a churning staff, by making it rest firmly on his back. He is the king of *samyamis* \(those who control their \(passions\), He makes the *Merudaṇḍa* to get steady by controlling its movements caused during the meditation of *Yogis. Yajnavarāha* \(the boar incarnation\) carried the earth to the *pātāla* \(nether worlds\) and saved the earth by slaying *Hiraṇyāksha*. Saving the earth from the rule of demon, he made it stand firm on his mountain top of \(*Dharma*\). *Trivikrama* put an end to *Bali’s* arrogance and restored to *Indra* his kingdom. He vanquished the demonic nature of *Bali* who was a *Paramabhāgavatottama* and bestowed a divine post upon him. He made known to the world the principle that he is the progenitor of *jnānagaṅga,* and that he is omnipresent and beyond the universe. The work and function of *Śiva* also convey the same yogic principles but in a different way. Annihilation of the demons, guarding of the *Dharmasetu*, and the position of *Yogacārya* are natural to him also.

The *Raudravīras*, mistaking the stories which are full of principles for mundane episodes, have woven elaborate stories. For example, *Śiva* is also called *\`Kūrmeśvara’*. Instead of describing him as the king of *Samyamis* \(people who can withdraw their senses like a tortoise\), and a *Yogācārya*, they have regrettably chosen to describe him as the one who killed *Vishṇu* in his *Kūrmāvatāra*.

5. *Śāstras* state that during the meditation of the *divya maṅgala vigraha* of Lord *Narasimha*, He appears to the *Sādhakas* as *Brahma* upto the navel, *Vishṇu* upto the neck, *Rudra* from that point upto the head, and in the form of *Parabrahman* beyond.

		
> आनाभि ब्रह्मणो रूपं आगलाद्वैष्णवं वपुः ।  
> आशीर्षं रुद्रमीशानं तदूर्ध्वं सर्वतः शिवम् ॥ 

Thus, *Rudra* is a part of the divine sacred form of god *Narasimha* himself. To say that *Rudra* tore open *Narasimha*, it amounts to say that *Rudra* tore open himself. Only *Śiva* knows what made him to committ suicide to escape suffering\! These stupids, having woven the story with some obsession have brought calamity to their own worshipful god\! They have indeed become a good example for the adage—“Devotees are a curse to god and disciples are a curse to the *guru*\!”

5. Again the story of *Vishṇu* in the form of *Ganḍabheruṇḍa* slaying *Śiva* in the form of *Śarabha*, is equally absurd. If *Vishṇu* happens to kill *Śiva* who is assigned with the task of destruction of the universe at the time of deluge well before that time, it will be against divine principles. How can *Vishṇu*, who has *Śiva* as the right part of his body, as evident in the saying *“valattanan tirupura merittavan”* of the *Ālvārs*, and who is united with him in the heart, kill him, and for what purpose?

Question: Some people interpret that the *Āranyakasruti ‘harigm harantam’* means that *Śiva* slew *Barsimha*. Is not that *Sruti* an authority?

		
Answer: Some have explained this *Śrutivikya* as—“gods follow *Rudra* who has slain *Vishṇu*.” But we wish to keep away both, on the lines of the adge—“That also is a broken argument, this is also a broken argument. Throw both of them out” And, this line appears in *‘mṛtyu sūkta.’* Why should either *śarabha or Gaṇḍabheruṇḍa* intrude there all of a sudden ? Neither of the two great commentators *Bhatta Bhāskara* or *Śāyaṇa* have commented in that sense. According to *Sāyaṇa*, the meaning is-“O almighty\! gods, like servants, follow you who happen to be *Mahāvishṇurūpi*, a redeemer of sins of the devotees, and the Lord of the universe. And being supreme, you inspire the intellect of all the beings.” *Bhattabhāskara* also considers this *mantra* as one addressed to *Prāṇadevata*.

Question: An *Upanishad* by name *‘śarabhopanishat’* states that *Rudra* slew *Vishṇu* who was in the form of *Śarabha*. And *Vishṇu rahasya* proclaims that *Vishṇu* in the form of *Ganḍabheruṇḍa* slew *Rudra*\! What is all this?

Answer: The *raudravīras* continue the story claiming that *Rudra* subjugated *Vishṇu* again, who came in the form of *ganḍabherunḍa* to slay him. *Vaishṇavavīras* may further continue the story stating that, later, *Vishṇu* in another form slew that *Rudra*. Persistence of untruth should be kept away, even if it makes an appearance in the guise of any text, be it *Upanishads*, *Purāṇas, Āgamas* or any such book. None of the *Ācāryas* in the Vedic tradition have quoted *Śarabhopanishad* as an authority. But we do not have to reject any parts of that *Upanishad* if they contain truthful aspects. Only the parts that are against truth should be ignored.

Question: How to detect interpolations in the books?

Answer: Interpolations can be detected by standards such as the difference of styles that may be in the book, contradictions, comparision with other authoritative books, historical happenings, review etc. But the inner experience of*jnānis* is the strongest proof. Because it is a universal truth that has been tested practically and can be done so for all the times.

Question: Why did our ancestors insert these interpolations in the religious literature?

Answer: It is because of false pride, hatred and also because of the evil desire to somehow defend their own side and gain fame.

Question: Who among *Śaivas* and *Vaishṇavas* spoke first with contempt for the other God? Who provoked first?

Answer: It is not possible to tell that. Somehow, both have the abundance of *Rāga* and *Dvesha.*

*Vīravaishṇavas* may boast-*“Rāvaṇa* is a devotee of *Śiva*. *Mahāvishṇu* in the form of *Śrīrāma* slew him. *Hiraṇyakaśipu* is also a devotee of *Śiva*. *Vishṇu* in the form of *Narasimha* tore him apart.” To this, the *Raudravīras* may reply “Why a mere a devotee of *Vishṇu*? Our god *Rudra* tore apart *Vishṇu* himself”, and may have kept on extending the story. The disputants who argue inconsistently like this, seem to have failed to note the following:

1\) The divine forms of *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* are indeed adorable to both *Śaivas* and *Vaishṇavas*. Because, according to *Vaishṇava Purāṇas*, *Vishṇu* is revered as *‘para devatā’* \(supreme deity\) and *Śiva* is respected as *‘parama Bhāgavata’*. And according to *Śaiva Purāṇas, Śiva* is *‘paradevatā’* and *Vishṇu* is his *‘parama bhakta’* \(supreme deovtee\) A devotee honestly worshipping either of them, can attain *parañjyoti* .

2\) *Rāma* killed *Rāvaṇa*, not for the reason that he worshipped *Śiva*. Because *Rāvaṇa* grew arrogant by the boon given by *Śiva* and became a bane to the world. Slaying of *Rāvaṇa* was acceptable to *Śiva* also. The reason why *Narasimha* killed *Hiraṇyakaśipu* was that he was a bane to the world. And he misused the *siddhis* \(boons\) he obtained from Lord *Brahma*. To establish his philosophy viz. “The body is the soul, *Artha* and *Kāma* are the only values of life, I *Hiraṇyakaśipu* am the Lord of everything, “ईश्वरोऽहमहं भोगी सिद्धो ऽहं बलवान् सुखी“ etc, he began to torture deities, *sādhus* \(pious people\) and devotees of god. And not because he worshipped either *Brahma* or *Śiva* was he subjugated. Even *Brahma* and *Rudra* felt happy that he was killed.

Question: Then, is the episode of *Śarabha* and *Ganḍabheruṇḍa* which appear in the *purāṇas* completely unfounded? Are all the parts of that episode interpolations?

Answer: Not that all the parts are interpolations. The basic form and figure do have credibility. The *Vīrabhaktas* have spiced it up and enhanced the *“Līlās”* \!

Question: Which are then the credible parts?

Answer: *Ugranarasimha, Śarabha* and *Ganḍabheruṇḍa* are all divine forms. All the three are ferocious in their form. We see them in a group in the *yogabhūmi*. For a short period a friction of pretence ensues there and soon their peaceful, benign forms manifest to the *sādhaka*. Their acts become complimentary to each other.

Question: How does it happen?

		
Answer: When the *yoga* occurs between *Vishṇu* in the ferocious form of *Narasimha* and *Rudra* in the *Śarabha* form, *Śarabha* draws the ferocious part in *Narasimha*. His divine consort *‘Narasimha nāyaki’* becomes *‘saumyanāyaki’*. Then the form of *Lakshmī Narasimha* is visualized. And when he places *Lakshmi* on his bosom and sits in deep meditation, we become blessed on visualizing HIS form of *Yogānarasimha.*

		
When *śarabha* is united with *Gaṇḍabheruṇḍa*, *Gaṇḍabheruṇḍa* attracts the power of *Mahāraudra* \(great terror\) from *śarabha*. Then *śarabha* becomes benign, peaceful and grants vision as *ŚāntasadāŚiva*. When *Uma*, \(his divine consort\) manifests and adores his left lap, he grants the blessed vision as *‘Umāmaheśvara’*. When she merges as divine power in the left half of his body, he becomes a feast to the eyes as he grants inner vision as *Yogarūḍha Dakshiṇāmūrti* immersed in deep meditation. *Gaṇḍabheruṇḍa* grants the vision of *Paramahamsayoga* with even wings and flies away to the supreme divine abode.

This story of the sacred *yoga* has been magnified by the handiwork of *“Vīrabhaktas”* and thus, the mutual “killing” has taken this distorted form.

Question: Can *Narasimha*, *śarabha* and *Gaṇḍabheruṇḍa* be worshipped in their ferocious forms also?

Answer: Yes, it can be done. We see such idols in temples too. In temples of *Śiva, Śarabha* is also called *Jvaraharamūrti*. As is evident from the line “भावशुद्धाय साध्याय सिद्धाय शरभाय च” in *Śrī Narasimha Sahasranāma stotra, Narasimha* is called also by the name *Śarabha.* As all the three are known to remove the three kinds of fever namely *Ādhyātmika, Ādhidaivika* and *Ādhibhautika,* all the three are called *“jvaraharamūrtī”*.

Question: Is *Narasimhavātāra* an incarnation in the inner realms or an event that \(actually\) took place in the external world?

This has been suggested already. This is a hapening of the glory of the eternal truth that took place, taking place now, and continues to take place in future also, in the realm of the internal world.

*Hiraṇyakaśipu* is the Lord of astonishing demoniacal powers endeavouring to establish the evil philosophy that wealth itself is food, clothing and everything in life. He is a marvellously accomplished person. But he uses the occult powers gifted by gods in the path of wickednes. Encroaching upon the positions and honor of *devatās*, he employs them in his service and harasses them. He tortures people who live a virtuous life. His glorious son *Prahlāda* is a crest jewel among the devotees of god who lead a life full of *Brahmānanda*. As evidenced from the line “प्रह्लादो जन्मवैष्णवः” he was a great devotee \(of *vishṇu*\) since birth. This *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, his retinue of demons and *Prahlāda* the *Bhāgavataśiromaṇi,* will manifest in their forms to the *sādhakas* in their inner world in a distinct time. Demons can do no harm to *Prahlāda* who is steadfast in devotion. But they cause unbearable distress to the travellers in the *Brahma mārga*. They have to invariably suffer this tyranny for some time. But god will protect them in due course of time. For this to happen, the companionship of *Prahlāda* provides help for that. In *yoga śāstra ‘merustambha’* means the spinal column. That itself is the pillar in the court hall of *Hiraṇyakaśipu*. Light emanates all of a sudden from the hole of the central *sushumnā nādi* which is at the centre of that \(*Merustambha*\). *Ugranarasimha* jumps out instantly with a boisterous laughter, clapping of hands, the sound of *Praṇava*, roar of a lion and his red tongue emitting fire, with flashes of lightning, and with the terrifying roar that frightens the demons. He possesses the human form below the neck. He weilds the conch, the discuss, the mace, the bow *pinaka*, and a bell in his hands. Even though frightened, the king of demons *Hiraṇyakaśipu*, pretending boldness, rushes to attack him, but is grasped with ease by *Narasimha. Narasimha* swallows many *astras* \(missiles\) shot at him by the demon who had escaped from his hands. Then hundreds of *Narasimhas* spring up from his body. They take care of the other demons who come to attack the Lord. As a last weapon, *Hiraṇyakaśipu* spits masses of *tamas* \(darkness\) at the Lord. Swallowing even them, the effulgent Lord *Narasimha* pulls *Hiraṇyakaśipu* with his long arms and placing him on his lap and positioning himself on the pedestal of the door, tears open his breast with his diamond hard claws \(easily\), like splitting a blade of grass. HE Removes his intestines, and wearing them as a garland, roars again and again. Then gods \(from heaven\) rain ambrosia and sound the musical instruments loudly and praise him with divine hymns.

ॐ नमो भगवते नरसिंहाय नमस्तेजस्तेजसे आविराविर्भव   
वानख वादंष्ट्र  
> कर्माशयान् रन्धय रन्धय तमो ग्रस ग्रस ओं स्वाहा  
अभयमभयमात्मनि भूयिष्ठा ओं क्ष्मौम् ॥” 

		
Even as *Śarabha* attracts his ferocious element, *Narasimha* becomes a *śāntamūrti* \(a benign form\). He proceeds to the throne and sits on it, in the benign form and gives *darshan* along with *Śrī \(Lakshmi*\). Only then *Pahlāda* becomes blessed. This is not a poetic story. These are scenes clearly seen in the yogic field.

In the upper right hand he weilds the *cakra* which represents the principle of the upward *manastattva*, in the left upper hand he has the conch, which represents the principle of ego, in the lower right hand, he sports the *jnānamudrā* and the *abhayamudrā* alternately. He has embraced *prakṛti* ie \(*Lakshmi*\) with his left arm firmly so that she may not slide down from the *Brahmabhāva*.

> एकेन चक्रमपरेण करेण शङ्खम् अन्येन सन्धुतनयामवलम्ब्य तिष्ठन् ।  
> वामे करेण वरदाभयपद्मचिह्नम् लक्ष्मीनृसिह मम देहि करावलम्बम् ॥ 

The white complexioned *Ādiśesha*, who is *prāṇasvarūpa*, is holding all his enlarged seven hooks like an umbrella above the head of *Narasimha*, offering him the service of embellishment. On the right side, boy *Prahlāda* joining his hands together in the form a cup stands blissfully, gazing at the face of the Lord.

In a short time *Narasimha* transforms himself into *Yogānarasimha* and becomes a feast to the eyes.

Though this form of *Narasimha* has his tongue stretched out with visible fangs, his countenance is highly benign; the gaze is pointing upwards, crossing the level of the brows; the broad forehead is shining with a line pointing upwards; He sports the divine crown, and the*Jālandhara bandha* in the throat, The upward pointing disc and the conch are representing the principles of mind and *ahankāra* held in the two upper hands, the region of the heart has the *Prāṇa* and *Āpana* regulated, *Yogamahālakshmi* is shining in the subtle form, in the right part of the chest. He shows the *Uḍyāṇabandha* and has swirly \(haired\) navel and shows the *Bhūsparśamudrā* in the lower hands. Salutations again and again to this auspicious form of *Yogānarasimha* who is teaching this very *yogavidyā* to those \(devotees\) who keep looking at him from foot to head, being completely absorbed in him.

“योगारूढमतिप्रसन्नवदनं योगानृसिंह भजे” 

Let us become fulfilled in this sacred evening worship of *Narasimha Jayantī* by worshipping, praising and meditating upon the forms of both *Bhogaśrisameta* and *Yogaśrīsameta Narasimha* who grants a pleasant darshan immediately after \(the withdrawl of\) his ferocious form.

> चेतोभृङ्गा भ्रमसि वृथा भवमरुभूमौ विरसायाम् ।  
> भज भज लक्ष्मीनरसिह्मानघपदसरसिजमकरन्दम् ॥ 

“Lord *Narasimha* is divine truth incarnate. He is experienced \(by devotees\) in the suprasensory *Yogasamādhi* and blesses \(devotees\) with divine knowledge, eternal bliss, prosperity and peace. He fulfills the wants of the devotees who have desires. He is the inner incarnation of lord *Nārāyaṇa Parañjyothi*.” These points have been brought to our mind by the abovesaid discussions in the question answer format. Now we shall have an insight to the other aspects of *Narasimhajayantī* which is to be observed in a special way.

### The Importance and specialty of this *Parva*:

1. This is one of the religious festivals celebrated with devotion and awe in all parts of *Bhārata.*

2. People of all *varṇas* have the right and eligibility to celebrate this festival.

“सर्वेषामेव वर्णानामधिकारोस्ति मद्दिने ।  
> मद्भक्तैस्तु विशेषेण कर्तव्यं मत्परायणैः ॥ 

3. All devotees of *Vishṇu*, and especially those who worship *Narasimha* as their family deity or a chosen deity, celebrate this *parva*. Even some *Śaivas* celebrate this *jayantī.*

4. As *śāstras* state that one would incur sin if this *vrata* is not observed, this festival can be considered a *‘nitya’ Vrata* also. And also, as it is stated that sins will be removed and *puṇya* and *purushārthas* are obtained by observing this *vrata* this, can be termed a *kāmyavrata* also.

“अन्यथा नरकं याति यावच्चन्द्रदिवाकरौ”  
“मज्जन्मसम्भवं पुण्यं व्रतं पापप्रणाशनम्”  
“वर्षे वर्षे तु कर्तव्यं मम सन्तुष्टिकारणम्”  
“हत्याकोटिविनाशनम्” 

5. Though the number of people who observe this *Vrata* is small, *śāstras* state that this festival is equally significant and great as *Rāmanavamī* or *Kṛshṇa jayantī* and other great festivals. As in the case of other great *parvas*, laudatory stories are narrated, associated with this *parva* also. For example: “At the beginning of the creation \(of universe\) lord Brahma observed this *vrata* and acquired the power to create this world comprising of the movable and the immovable. Only by observing this *vrata, Rudradeva* got the ability to kill the demon *tripurāsura*. *Bhakta prahlāda* was deeply immersed and devoted towards a prostitute in his previous life. Once, on the day of *Narasimha jayantī* either unknowingly or for some reason, he and his harlot maintained a vow of silence and fasted. As a result of this, the prostitute obtained a place among the nymphs. And this person who was passionate in that harlot was born as the supreme devotee *Prahlāda* in his next birth. This *vrata* is like a wish yielding cow *kāmadhenu*, which grants male issues to the childless, and power, kingdom, wifehood and wealth and fortunes to people who seek them. It grants all wealth, enjoyments and fortunes in this world, and also emancipation in the other world. Either *Brahma* or *Śiva* or even god *Narasimha* for that matter, cannot describe the complete greatness of this *vrata”*. We see in *Vratakalpas* that stories carrying this purport were told by *Narasimha* himself to *Prahlāda*. Stories of this kind are called as *‘Ārthavāda’*. Their intention is only to describe the greatness of this *vrata* to people and to create an interest in them. They need not be considered as historical truths.

6\) This *Vrata* demands a high level of *Ācāraśuddhi* \(Purity\)

### When to perform this \(*vrata*\)and at what time?

There is no difference of opinion regarding the observance of this *vrata* which falls on on *vaiśākha śukla caturdaśī*.

> नरसिह्मश्चतुर्दश्यां वैशाखे शुक्लपक्षके”  
“वैशाखे शुक्लपक्षे तु चतुर्दश्यां निशामुखे ।  
> मज्जन्मसम्भवं पुण्यं व्रतं पापप्रणाशनम्”॥ 

Should this *parva* be celebrated as per as per *sauramāna* or *cāndramāna?* We should note that both these are in practice. But as is evident from *“vrathe cāndramasam śastam”*, it is best to observe this *vrata* according to the lunar calendar. If any \(unforeseen\) problems or obstacles occur in the *Narasimha jayantī* of *cāndramāna*, then it may be observed according to the *sauramāna*. But it may be remembered that the observance according to *cāndramāna* is more in vogue.

It is clear that *Narasimha jayantī* should be observed on *vaiśākha śuddha caturdaśī*. But, what should be the extent of *caturdaśī* on that day? Should the star, *yoga* and *Karaṇa* of the day also be given importance along with *caturdaśī*? This needs to be discussed now.

*Caturdaśī tithi* is the most important factor in deciding the day of *Narasimha Jayanti*. *Caturdaśi* must prevail at sun-set on that day. “If the *pradosha of caturdaśi* extends on both the days, when should the *vrata* is to be observed?”—In such a case it should be observed on the second day. Even if the *Pradosha* does not extend to both the days, celebration of the *vrata* should be done on the second day only. Even if it extends to both the days partly and evenly, then the observation will be the same \(i.e. on the second day\). “What should be the day of observance if *Caturdaśi* happens to extend unevenly on both the days?” *Nirṇayasindhu* says that the day of observance is the day on which the *Vyāpti* of *Caturdaśi* is more.

“दिनद्वयेऽपि तद् व्याप्तौ, अंशतः समव्याप्तौ च परा, विषमव्याप्तौ  
> त्वधिकव्याप्तिमती, दिनद्वयेऽपि अव्याप्तौ परा” 

The special worship of *Narasimha jayantī* should be performed on the day when *caturdaśī tithi* is beyond the *vedhī* of *trayodaśī* for a period of three *muhūrtas* \(one *muhūrta* is equal to 48 minutes\). If such a *vedhā* occurs, that day should be omitted, and observance should be on the day when there is no *vedhā* i.e. on the next day. Even if that \(next\) day happens to be a full moon day *Narasimha Jayanti* should be observed on that day only.

> त्रिमुहूर्तत्रयोर्दशीवेधरहितायाम्  
> वैशाखशुद्धत्रयोदश्यां प्रदोषकाले  
> श्रीनरसिह्मजयन्ती विशेषाराधनं कृत्वा. . . .   
> न च पौर्णमास्यां नृसिह्मजयन्ती सम्भवे” \(दशनिर्णयी अनुबन्ध\) 

Some *śāstras* state that *Narasimhajayantī* should not be observed when there is the *vedhā* of *Trayodaśi*, and some other *Śāstras* state that if *caturdaśi* prevails during *Pradosha*, the *vrata* should be observed on that day. To clear this contradiction, some people say that *Vaishṇavas* should observe the *vrata* on the first day, and *Smārtas* on the second day. Here the word *Vaishṇava* means those who follow *āgamas* like *Pāñcarātra, Vaikhānasa* etc. But these attributes viz *Smārta, Śrīvaishṇava* and *Vaishṇava* are of recent origin. These differences were not known to ancient religious scholars who laid down religious rules and regulations. So this elucidation does not appear satisfactory.

However, ***Śrī Raṅgamahāguru*** had in this regard, commanded as follows:

“Paramaikāntis and paramahamsas who have not an iota of attachment towards wordly benefits, should observe this vrata on a clear day which does not have the vedhā. Others i.e. those who desire both Moksha and Purushārthas, should observe it on the day of Caturdaśi even if there is vedhā“ We humbly remember this and beg to state that this elucidation is objective.

Just as the Śuklapaksha caturdaśī is dear to Lord *Narasimha*, star *svāti*, Monday, Saturday, *Siddhayoga* and *Vaṇijakaraṇa* are dear to him. So, if the above happen to occur on the day of *Narasimhajayantī* that day will be most commendable.

> वैशाखस्य चतुर्दश्यां सोमवारेनिलर्क्ष्यके,  
> अवतारो नृसिह्मस्य” \(टोडरानन्द-स्कान्दवचन\) 

> “स्वातीनक्षत्रयोगे च शनिवारे तु मद्व्रतम्  
सिद्धयोगस्य संयोगे वणिजे करणे तथा ।  
> पुंसां सौभाग्ययोगेन लभ्यते दैवयोगतः,  
> सर्वैरेतैस्तु संयुक्तं हत्याकोटिविनाशनम् ।  
> एतदन्यतरे योगे मद्दिनं पापनाशनम् ॥ 

Although the above said *tithi, vāra, nakshatra, yoga* and *karaṇa* are all most commendable for the observance of *narsimha jayantī*, the most important is the *caturdaśī tithi*.

“केवलेऽपि प्रकर्तव्यं तद्दिनं व्रतमुत्तमम्”

Even if the above said *vara, Nakshatra, yoga* and *Karaṇas* do not eventuate, the *vrata* should be observed if it is *caturdaśī*. If the other ones \(such as *Vāra, nakshatra* etc\) happen to occurr, it is fine and if all of the happen to occur on that day, it will be best.

As per the above, the day of observance of *Narasimhajayantī*, may be decided.

But, at what time on that day the special worship of God has to be performed, remains a controversy.

अवतारो नृसिह्मस्य प्रदोषसमये द्विजाः”  
“महाप्रदोषसमयो नृहरेः समुपागतः”  
> सम्भृताश्चैव सम्भाराः कल्पितान्यासनान्यपि  
“कूर्मस्सिह्मो बौद्धकल्की च सायम्”  
“चतुर्दश्यां निशामुखे । मज्जन्मसम्भवं पुण्यम्” 

When it is clear from the above *ślokas* that the incarnation of Lord *Narasimha* happened in the *Pradosha* only, why should there be any doubt at all? The above *ślokas* are not considered trustworthy. A work on *Dharmaśāstra Mīmāmsa* makes a strong comment as follows: “The abovesaid *ślokas* are not to be taken as authentic. There is no proof that the incarnation happened in the evening time. Instead, there are authentic *ślokas* which state that the festival should be observed in the afternoon, and especially in the latter part of *caturdaśī tithi*, when there is the pervasion of *Vaṇija Karaṇa*.

> ततो मध्याह्नवेलायां नद्यादौ विमले जले ।  
> परिधाय ततो वासः व्रतकर्म समाचरेत् ॥ 

		
So, it should be observed in the afternoon only, as per this authentic verse. It is foolish to worship in the evening”.

But it has to be noted that the above *ślokas* which state that *Narasimhavatāra* took place in the evening are not unauthentic. The first *śloka* appearing there, is quoted in the *vratamālā*. \(p.415 *Narasimhajayantī Vratam*\) The other *ślokas* too are found in *Nṛshmapurāṇa* and *Nṛshima pūjakalpas.* Texts such as *Śrīmadbhāgavatam* indicate that *Narasimha* incarnated in the evening only. It is because *Hiraṇyakaśipu* sought a boon from *Brahma* that he should not meet with death either in the night or during day time or either on earth or in the sky. *Śrīmadbhāgavatam skandha* 7, chapter 4\). If that has to be honoured, the incarnation of the Lord must have happened in the evening only. So, the opinion that the worship on *Narasimha jayantī* should be done in the evening is correct.

Those who cannot fast till the evening because of physical weakness or due to the pressure and burden of other worldly occupations, can perform it at least in the afternoon. Generally, such people worship god during *Śrī Kṛshṇajayantī* and *Śivaratri*, in the afternoon itself. If it is not possible to do it in the stipulated time, it can be performed in the nearest possible time.

Then, why is afternoon stipulated for the *vrata,* as per the statement “Bath should be had in the afternoon itself in the pure waters of river etc, and *vrata* should be begun with the wearing of clean clothes”? The purport is, the parts of the *Vrata* such as bath, vow, worship, *Pārāyaṇa* etc., should be begun in the afternoon itself. The main worship should be done in the evening only. Nowhere has it been stated that the main worship should be done in the afternoon. And also, no statement of authority is found enjoining that worship should not be done in the evening. But there are statements of authority which stipulate that the main worship should be performed in the evening. Customarily also, we see that the worship is being performed in the evening only, by and large.

Even in everyday worship, the evening time has been specially commended for the *darshan* of Lord *Nṛsimha*. Idols of *Vishṇu* should not be seen \(for *darśana*\) at *pradosha*.

“न प्रदोषे हरिं पश्येत् ऋते नृहरिराघवौ।” 

Thus, when *Pradosha* is recommended for *Narasimha* even in daily worship, it is not justifiable to argue that the main worship on the day of *Narasimhajayanti* should not be performed in the evening. In an authentic text by name *kālamādhavīya*, the evening *pūja* itself is enjoined conclusively, in the chapter *caturdaśī vratamīmāmsa*.

“नैतत्सारं यथा विनायकव्रतं मध्याह्ने पूजयेन्नृपाः” इतिमध्याह्नः कर्मकालत्वेन विहितः नात्र तथा विधिरस्ति, उदाहृतं तु लिङ्गं अर्थवादवत् न स्वातन्त्रेण कस्यचित् अर्थस्य प्रापकं, किन्तु सति प्रमाणान्तरे तस्य उपोद्बलकं भवति। न चात्र प्रमाणान्तरं पश्यामः अतः मध्याह्नः कर्माङ्गकालः न विहितः \(page 153 Kannada script edition\)

“Which is the right time for observing *Nṛsimha jayanti”*? ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru had commanded as follows in this regard: “Any time for that matter, at which the darśana of Lord *Narasimha* in the *Merustambha* in us is being had, will be the time for the observance of *Nṛsimha jayanth*i. *Śāstra* texts state that the time at which the souls are taken naturally towards such a yoga, is the time of Nṛsimha Jayantī.” Remembering these words which throw light on the truth and which provide inspiration, we wish to conclude as follows: *“pradosha samaya* of *Vaiśākha Śuddha Caturdaśi* is excellent for the special worship of *Narasimha Jayanti*. If star *Svātī, Monday* or *Saturday*, *siddha yoga* and the *vanijakaraṇa* also happen to occur on \(that day\) it will be more precious.”

Next, we will take up for discussion, the modalities of the worship of *Śrīnṛsimha jayanti* and the reasons for that.

### *Madivantike* \(ritualistic purity\) :

*Narasimhajayanthi* is a day when God in the form of *Narasimha* should be worshipped specially. *Pūjā kalpas* have stipulated special purity to falicitate that special worship. Here *‘madi’* means purity of all kinds and virtuous conduct. Only if purity is accomplished in the five sense organs, the body, intellect, mind, materials, place and deeds, it can be termed as *Śāstrīya* purity.

> पोन्द्रियस्य देहस्य बुद्धेश्च मनसस्तथा ।  
> द्रव्यदेशक्रियाणां च शुद्धिराचार इष्यते ॥ 

Some say—*“madi* \(purity\) is the opposite of *‘mailige’* \(impurity\). A \(cloth or a\) thing which is cleansed at the time of *madi* \(purity\) and which is not touched while in *mailige* is *madi”* Ordinary people think that even unclean clothes satisfying the above description will be *‘madi’*. But dirty clothes will be treated as *mailige* only in the eyes of the *śāstras*, even if they happen to be *madi* of *madis.*

Incidentally we may remember the words “ अश्रीकरमसौम्यं च मलिनं नैव धारयेत् ”

**a\) Special reason for this *madivantike***

“Purity conforming to the *śāstras* should be observed in all the rituals, *śubha* or *puṇya*. But in the worship of *Śrī Narasimha, Śrī Hayagrīva* and *Śrī Mṛtyuñjaya* etc, there is a tradition of observing extraordinary *madivantike*. The reason attributed by ordinary people is that these gods are prone to anger and so even if there is a small slip in the procedures during worship, they get angry and cause torment to the worshipper. But this is not correct. Because, these gods also have benign pleasant forms and not just the ferocious forms. Even there, the ferocious actions are directed only against evil people, and not towards devotees who are immersed in god. We see words in the composition of devotees such as *“Cheluva Narasimha” “Śānta Narasimha” “Alahiya Śingar”* etc,.

Though these deities are divine evolutions of the almighty who is beyond the three *guṇas* \(viz *sattva, rajas* and *tamas*\), at times and at their own will, they put on the coats of *rajas* or *tāmas*. If they are worshipped in such forms, the devotees can obtain fulfillments related to those virtues. Some worship them for relief from slow poison administered with food, blackmagic, downfall from legitimate position, loss of money etc. Some devotees may aspire for wealth and desires also. *Paramaikāntis* may pray for *Moksha* only. Some others may pray for other *Purushārthas* along with *Moksha*, but not opposed to it. So, keeping in mind their wishes, the devotees worship the *Sāttvic*, * Rājasic* or *Tāmasic* forms of this God, or the ones beyond them. Whatever may be the forms, they do not cause fear, but cause love only.

The following incident, described vividly in *Śrīmadbhāgavata* makes it clear that *Narasimha* even in the ferocious form does not terrify his devotees who are unique.

> प्रह्लादं प्रेषयामास ब्रह्मावस्थितमन्तिके ।   
> तात प्रशमयोपेहि स्वपित्रे कुपितं प्रभुम् ॥  \(भागवत VII-9-2\) 

Lord *Ugranarasimha* started roaring, after tearing open *Hiraṇyakaśipu* and making a garland of his intestines and wearing it. *Hiraṇyakaśipu* was terribly tormenting *Prahlāda* the great devotee. Even though *Brahma* and other devotees praised the Lord, no one would dare to go near him. Then God *Brahma* went near *Prahlāda* and said. “My child\! Lord *Narasimha* is angry with your father. Please pacify him”, and sent him near *Narasimha*. That supreme child-devotee fearlessly went near the Lord and prostrated at his lotus feet. Lord *Narasimha* lifted the child devotee with affection and made him sit on his lap, placed his ambrosial hand which was a destroyer of the fear of death, on *Prahlāda’s* head. Immediately *Prahlāda* had the vision of the supreme deity and praised the Lord with a voice choked with devotion.

The enigmatic question here is, why *Prahlāda* did not fear even a little when great gods such as *Brahma* and others were afraid with terror, on seeing the terrible form of *Narasimha*? It won’t be correct to say that *Prahlāda* was just a child and so did not have fear. We can see that many things which are just a matter of fun for elders can cause fear in children.

If someone merely says—*“Prahlāda* is a devotee. And so he was not afraid,“ a question arises whether *Brahma* did not have devotion towards the almighty.

“The cause of fear is said to be from something which is different from oneself. “द्वितीयस्माद्वै खलु भयं"भवति”. But *Prahlāda* was a *Paripūrṇa* with the experience that there existed nothing different from him and everything was *paramātmamaya,* and so he felt no fear”-some say. Pertaining to this incident some people quote a statement from *Taittirīya Upanishad* “उदरमन्तरं कुरुते, अथ तस्य भयं भवति” and explain it as follows:-Even if a very slight difference is felt between onself and the supreme entity, there will be a cause for fear. As *Prahlāda* felt that there was no difference between himself and Lord *Narasimha*, he was least afraid.

Some try to explain-“This is a matter related to *Dhyāna*. Sometimes a break called *Antara* happens during meditation. Only in the event of such an *Antara*, fear is felt. Since *Prahlāda* was in a state of unbroken meditation without any *Antara*, he experienced no fear.

**So, a question arises whether even a devotee could be disturbed by** a vega \(A kind of an agitational impulse\) of fear during meditation till a particular level and, if so, does that vega cease after that level. Here, we would like to quote the explanation provided by Śrī Raṅgamahāguru who was a Dhyānasiddha. He said—

“There will be no vega of fear during dhyāna after one crosses the Mahattattva. Even gods many experience fear when they are below that. As Prahlāda had crossed even the Mahattattva during Dhyāna, he felt no fear even on seeing the exceedingly ferocious form of Lord Śrī Narasimha. The other gods were below that level of Mahattattva at the time of seeing the Lord, and so were frightened. There would be no fetters like fear or shyness, when the Mahattattva is crossed.“

Thus, even the form of *Ugranarasimha* is indeed dear to the devotees. So, the insisting of a higher level of *madi* in his worship is not because of the ferocious form and dispositions of *Narasimha*. The real reason is that a state of complete purity in the devotee is a must to ascend to the *Samādhi* state in the meditation of that deity. As even a trace of impurity may bring about a disturbance in the meditation, that \(much of a high\) level of purity is insisted. This rule applies in the worship of *Śrī Hayagrīva, Śrī Mṛtyuñjaya* and such other deities.

**c\) Materials and the condition of the body and the mind needed for the worship.**

*Brahmacarya*, restraint of the mind, speech and actions, compassion towards all living beings etc are the inner accomplishments required for the worship on that day. Sandal Paste, flowers, incense, *Dīpa* and *Naivedya* etc are the materials needed externally, which the devotees should arrange for, depending on the means.

**d\) Rules and precepts of worship**

After taking bath early in the morning and completing the daily religious rituals, a vow should be made for the worship, and a prayer should be made to God to grace an obstacle free accomplishment of the same. Special worship should be offered in the evening. Fasting should be observed at least till the time of worship. Those who cannot afford to fast, may have some light food, allowed by the *śāstras*.

**e\) Naivedya and leaves and flowers**

Which are the special things that are to be offered for the worship of lord *Narasimha*? Laymen may say that the food dear to a lion should be offered, as Lord *Narasimha* is lion faced\! Such people should note here that the ‘lion’ described as the face of the lord is not a physical material \(as animal lion\) seen in the external world.

Scriptures prescribe a sweet rice cake called *ereyappa* as a special *naivedya* to *Śrī Narasimha*. “गुडापूपं नृसिंहाय”. By offering this *sāttvik* food to God and taking the *prasāda*, the tranquility of the *dhātus* is brought about, and the centers pertaining to the visualization of Lord *Narasimha* open up, and so the *śāstras* prescribe these *dravyas* \(materials/preparations\) for the worship.

Other than this, greengram and bengalgram preparations, and juices of wood apple and lemon are offered in the special worship of the Lord. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru used to explain—“When one reaches the Samādhi state, upheavels take place \(in the body\). These things \(materials and offerings for worship\) help in bringing \(the upheavel in the devotee\) back to the normal state.”

It should be noted that the above said items prescribed as *Naivedya* to Lord *Narasimha* are not meant to relieve him of thirst and hunger. But they are prescribed to help the *Sādhakas* to easily ascend to the *Bhāva* of *Narasimha*, and to keep their body and mind in good shape. We come across *śastravacanas* like “यदन्नः पुरुषो भवति तदन्नास्तस्य देवताः” When such is the case, why should a special *naivedya* be prescribed? The above rule is a general one. But when one cannot afford the special items stated above \(for *naivedya*\), the general rule \( i.e. the food of the person can be offered as *naivedya*\) itself, can be followed with full devotion.

As *Narasimha* possesses a dual form of both *Vishṇu* and *Rudra*, *tulasi* and lotus recommended for the worship of *Nārāyaṇa*, and *Bilva* and red hibiscus etc prescribed for the worship of *Śiva*, can be offered for the special worship on that day.

### Medium of worship

Lord *Narasimha* can be worshipped in the forms of *sāligrāma yantra*, idols or through sacrificial fire. Special worship should be offered by way of chanting *Śrī Narasimha mantra*, *upanishads* and *vedas.*

### Fasting and breaking the fast

The practice of *Pāraṇa* after the offering of special worship in the evening is also there. “उत्सवान्ते च पारणम्”

The custom of fasting for the whole day \(on the day of Narasimhajayanti\) and doing Pāraṇa the next morning is also prevalent. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru had explained that both these customs are approved by the scriptures. The first custom is to be followed by those who are Paramaikāntis who seek only moksha, and the second one is for sādhakas who observe the vrata seeking the four fold purushārthas.

It will be most proper to spend the night of that festival by listening to stories related to *Śrī Narasima*, and in singing his glories. There is also a tradition in some devotees who fast on that day and, after performing *Uttarārādhana* the next day, gift the idol of *ŚrīNarasimha* to the deserving ones.

Those who fast for the whole day on the day of *Narsimhajayantī*, should perform the concluding worship early in the morning on the next day. As part of worship, some people do *‘Śrī Nṛsimhajapa,* chant the *mantra*, invoke him in the holy fire and perform worship through *homa*. After the *Pārāyaṇa* of the *Nrsimhatāpinī Upanishad*, cooked rice and ghee should be offered as *Havis* in the *Homa* by chanting *Purushasūkta* and the *Narasimha Gāyatri mantra.* \(ॐ वानाखाय विद्महे | तीक्ष्णदग्ग्ंष्ट्राय  धीमहि । तन्नो नारसिग्ंहः प्रचोदयात्॥\) There is also a custom of performing *Jalatarpaṇapūja* with *Nrsimhagāyatrī* itself. The custom of performing this *Homa* after doing *Shoḍaśopacāra* and gifting the idol of god which was worshipped, to the deserving ones is also there.

There upon, *tīrtha* and *prasāda* should be had, and after *Bhāgavata samārādhana*, *pāraṇa prasada* should be taken. Those who complete the worship on the day of *Narasimhajayanti* itself, can do *paraṇa* after the *Shoḍaśopacārapūja*, *Japa* and *homa* and *Bhāgavatārādhana* in the same night.

If affordable, devotees can perform *shoḍaśopacāra pūja*, *Homa, Tarpaṇa* etc. Those who cannot afford in terms of money, time and health, should meditate upon god, do the *japa* and chant the *stotras*. If any materials needed for worship happen to be unavailable, their presense should be sentimentally felt and worship should be offered to God.

There is no need of \(the regular\) external materials at all to perform *hṛdyāga* or *Mānasārādhana*. If one can offer his dispositions of the mind, the conscience, and the *Jīva* to the *paramātma* who is at their summit in the form of fire, it also amounts to a *Homa*. “प्रत्यग्रूपे हविषि युवयोरेकशेषित्वयोगात्” श्रीस्तुति वेदान्त देशिक, “आत्मनि स्वप्रकाशाग्नौ चित्तमेकाहुतिं क्षिपेत्” श्रीशङ्क,अरभगवत्पाद\) Let us give the holy bath to Lord *Narasimha* with the stream of the mind which is absorbed in god. Let us offer all services to God like *Arghya, Pādya, Āchamanīya, Snāna* and *Pāna* from the water viz the pure mind taken from the river viz *śraddhā* \(pure devotion\). Let us offer the *Mānasa Pushpañjali* to God from the flowers of *Bhāva* \(feelings\) and *Samādhi*. Let us offer as *Naivedya* our very pure souls, to the God of Gods.

> श्रद्धानदीविमलचित्तजलाभिषेकै-  
र्नित्यं समाधिकुसुमैरपुनर्भवाय”  
> शेषभूतं स्वमात्मानं शेषिणे परमात्मने ।  
> अर्पयेत्परया भक्त्या महानैवेद्यमेव तत् ॥ 

Even those who are financially poor can perform the spiritual *pūja* using their own senses, mind, soul etc which are not dependant on others. If this spiritual worship is not done, the benefit obtained from external worship will be meagre. If the spiritual worship is done well, no blemish can be there even if the external worship cannot be performed for some reasons. Those who can afford should perform the external worship also. Because, the things used for external worship, should also be offered to God in the form of a *Yajna* and they can become fruitful. Ordinary people too are rendered holy by taking that *prasāda* \(of the worship\). For this very reason, this *śloka* is included in the *Pūja Kalpa*:

		
> भगवन् पुण्डरीकाक्ष हृद्यागं तु मया कृतम् ।  
> आत्मसात्कुरु देवेश बाह्ये त्वां सम्यगर्चये ॥ 

\(O lotus eyed Lord residing in my lotus heart\! I have \(just now\)done the *Hṛdyāga.* \(Please accept this\!\) Now I am going to worship you externally. O Lord of Gods\!

As per the words ‘ न प्रदोषे हरिं प्रश्येत् ’ the worship of *Mahāvishṇu* is prohibited during *Pradosha*. Then how come Lord *Narasimha* who is an *avatāra* of *Vishṇu* is worshipped in the twilight only? It is because the *purāṇas* state that the incarnation time of *Śrīnarasimhasvāmi* is the evening itself. If one turns his vision inwards and meditates, even the external nature becomes helpful and takes him to the experience of the glory of the natural manifestation of *Narasimha*. *Yogaśāstras* call our backbone *“maha merustambha”*.

“आस्फालयेन्महामेरुं कम्पन्ते तत्र देवताः”

When our inner self is invaded by demoniacal forces, it becomes the pillar of the court of *Hiraṇyakaśipu*. By the influence of the highest devotion of a pure soul in the form of *Prahlāda*, Lord *Narasimha* roars the *Praṇava* and manifests with a form which terrifies the demons, after breaking asunder that pillar. He sits on the threshold which is the middle region of the abode of the interior.

> लयविक्षेपयोस्सन्धिः मनस्तत्र निरामयम् ।  
> स सन्धिस्साधितो येन स मुक्तो नात्र संशयः ॥ \(सदाचारस्तुति\) 

Our Gurudeva had expounded this as follows:-“At the evening time which is the meeting moment of Laya and Vikshepa \(the Lord\) tears open the chest of the demon king who is the embodiment of Avidyā and sits on his throne, mounting it. In reality it is the throne of meditation of god. Liberating it from the invasion of the demons, and purifying it, he sits on it and reestablishes the kingdom of devatās”. Thus, the sandhyākāla is indeed the most commendable time for the worship of the inner Lord.

In the divine form of *Narasimha*, the part above his neck is the region of Lord *Rudra*. “आशीर्षं रुद्रमीशानम्” So, it is indeed highly proper to worship him in the *Pradosha*. The *Āgamas* state that the *darśan* of *Śiva* during the evening twilight redeems all sins.

Which form of *Narasimha* should be worshipped on *Narasimhajayanti*? Is it his ferocious form? Or is the benign pleasing form? The answer to this is as follows:—The ferocious form should be worshipped in *Sandhyākāla*. He, the eight armed Lord of Lords, who holds the conch, the disc, the mace, the bow, the goad and the bell in six hands, and he who tears open the chest of the demon king in the remaining two hands, should be worshipped. He should be worshipped as *Narasimha parañjyoti* . He \(The Lord\) who holds upwards the conch, the disc, the bow, the mace and the goad which represent the *tattvas* viz *manas, buddhi, ahaṅkāra, mahattatva,* and *sukshmajnāna*; he whose vitality is upwards, as is evident from the words “ऊअर्ध्वरेतं विरूपाक्षं विश्वरूपाय वै नमः” and he who sounds loudly the *omkāra* with the divine bell; he the *yogācārya* who terrifies the demons and tears open the chest of the demon the epitome of *Avidyā,* and He who contains the three *guṇas* \(viz *sattva, rajas* and *tamas*\) and yet beyond them, should be meditated upon.

One should meditate upon *Prahlāda* who appears with joined cupped hands and who is endowed with child-like nature. \(The *Upanishads* state that a great *Yogi* should be child like\) “बाल्येन तिष्ठासेत् “ Also *Brahma* and other gods who are hailing victory with joined cupped hands, the attendants of *Vishṇu* and *Garuḍa* who are his retinue, should be meditated upon.

At the latter part or the concluding part of the worship, one should meditate upon *Saumyalakshmīnarasimha* as \(the Lord\) who has *Lakshmī* as his *Parāprakṛti* \(supreme nature\) sitting on his lap and who has embraced her. *Prahlāda* in the posture with joined cupped hands, should also be worshipped along with this form of *Narasimha*. The five vital airs, unidirectional and proceeding upwards even beyond the head and in the form of *Kunḍaliniśeshanāga* serving the Lord as an umbrella, should be meditated upon. Those who have a special desire for *Yogasiddhi* should later meditate upon the form of *Yogānarasimha* and worship him.

“Lord *Yogānarasimha,* is adorned with the conch and the disc both facing upwards in the two upper hands. Though his two lower hands are pointing downwards because of the *Bhūsparśamudrā,* he holds them in such a way that the *vrittis* move upwards. He is bound by *Yogapatta* at the knees. He looks graceful in the *Mūlabandha, Uddyāṇabandha* and the *Jālandharbandha* in the region of *Mulādhāra*, *udara* and *kanṭha*. His sight has gone above and beyond the pair of eyebrows. The tongue displaying the *Lambikāyoga* is protruding outside. He is the *Paramapurusha* whose *Prakṛti* is not exhibited but has been made to merge within. He is a form of pure white complexion”-with this comprehension, Lord *Yogānṛsimha* should be meditated upon.

We hereby \(wish to\) offer this service \(i.e. the discussion regarding *Narasimhajayanti*\) along with a *mantravarṇa* which is stated in *Śrīmadbhāgavatam* as a *Mahāmantra* which, *Prahlādarāyaru* keeps chanting and praising.

“ॐ नमो भगवते नरसिह्माय नमस्तेजस्तेजसे आविराविर्भव वानख वादंष्ट्र कर्माशयान् रन्धय रन्धय तमो ग्रस ग्रस ओं स्वाहा अभयमभयमात्मनि भूयिष्ठा ओं क्ष्मौम् ॥





	 
## Navarātra Mahotsava

*Navarātra* is a very important *parva* in the garland of festivals of the *Sanātana Āryabhāratiyas*. There is no doubt that this is the most important of all the festivals celebrated in the *Āśvayujamāsa*. This is a festival which is specially celebrated in all parts of India. People of all *Āśramas* can celebrate this and even the *Mlecchās* who do not fully come under *Āryadharma,* are entitled \(eligible\) to celebrate this *parva*.

> स्नातैः प्रमुदितैर्हृष्यैः ब्राह्मणैः क्षत्रियैर्नृपैः।  
> वैश्यैः शूद्रैर्भकियुक्तैः म्लेच्छैरन्यैश्च मानवैः॥  
> एवम् नानाम्लेच्छगणैः पूज्यते सर्वदस्युभिः ।  
> अङ्गवङ्गकलिङ्गैश्च किन्नरैः बर्बरैः शकैः॥ \(भविष्योत्तरपुराण\) 

There are six different *darśanas* relating to *Bhaktadarśana*, viz - *śaiva, vaishṇava, śākta, soura, gāṇapatya* and *kaumāra*. People belonging to any of these paths can celebrate *Navarātra*. Because, *‘Śakti’* is the goddess who is specially worshiped in this *parva*. As all the *deities* of *bhakti pantha* are *Śaktisampannās* only, they will be pleased by the observance of this *parva*.

“परास्य शकिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च”

As both *Śvetāśvataropanishat* and *Śrīmadbhāgavata* say, the Lord is *Śaktiviśishṭa* only.

“सञ्जीवयत्यखिलशकिधरस्स्वधाम्ना”

This is the *parva* in which *Śakti* part of the Lord is worshipped specially. Thus, this is a *parva* which is acceptable to the people of all the *dharmas*. If it is not possible to observe this *parva* for all the nine days, it should be observed atleast on the last four days, or three days, or two days or atleast on the last day. Elders insist that at least *Mahāshṭamī* or *Mahānavamī* should be celebrated and the festival should never go uncelebrated. Such is this great *Parva* called *Navarātramahotsava*.

This festival is called by two famous names viz. *Navarātra* and *Durgotsava*. This is also called *Daśāha* of *Dasarā* by including the *Vijayadaśamī* which is the tenth day. The name *‘Navarātra’* matches this well as \(the festival is\) completed in nine nights, or nine days and nights. Even if it is not fully observed on all the nine days, or even if celebrated inclusive of *Viajadaśamī* on the tenth day, this festival is technically called *Navarātra* only. It is quite conforming to the *śāstras* to term the nine days beginning from the *Prathamā* of the *Caitramāsa śuklapaksha* as *Vasantanavarātra* and the nine days beginning from the *Prathamā* of *Śaratkāla* as “शरद्वसन्तयोस्तुल्य एव दुर्गोत्सवः कार्यः” But, as the *Navarātra* celebrated in the *śaratkāla* has special significance, the custom of calling that alone as *Navarātra* is in vogue. And as *Durgādevī* is worshipped in different forms viz., *Lakshmī, Sarasvatī* and *Durgā*, the name *Mahotsava* is also justified.

*“Navarātra* is a festival which brings in freshness to life. Worship the *Śuddha Prakṛtimāta* as *Lakshmī* in the first three days, as *Sarasvatī* in the next three days, and as *Gaurī* or *Durgā* in the last three days, and purify your dispositions. The sky outside will be clear without clouds and within also, it is a clear *Jnānākaśa*. Outside, lotuses are in full blossom and inside in the *Mānasa sarovara*, lotuses in the form of heart etc. blossom. Worship the goddess there, who is the *parāprakṛti* of the Lord and become *Śuddhasattvas*. Outside, it is plenty with *Dhana* and *Dhānya*. Inside it is the plenty of *Ātmadhana*. Outside, it is the expedition of the *Vīrakshatrīyas* for the victory of *Dharma*, and inside it is the expedition for *Ātmavijaya*. All these are combined in this *Mahāparva”*—**This was the great command of *ŚrīRaṅgaguru* given in the very best messge proclaiming the significance of this Parva and we humbly remember it here.** Though this period is excellent for the meditation and *Upāsana* of all deities, it is a time very helpful for the propritiation of *Śaktidevatā*. When suitable *tithi, vāra, nakshatra, yoga, karaṇa* etc can not found on other days, the custom of celebrating auspicious functions like marriage, *upanayana* etc during *Navarātra* is in vogue, without worrying much about those features like suitable *tithi, vāra*, *nakshatra, yoga, karaṇa* and *grahamaitri*, etc. Especially the day of *Vijayadaśamī* has that great *Mahimā*, people say. This greatness is associated with *Navarātra*, as it is blessed with the special presence of *Durgā Devī* who makes people cross all *durgas*. The etymology of the word *Durgā* is, the one who makes people cross *Durgas* or, the one who prevents people from *Durgati”*, they say.

> तामग्निवर्णां तपसा ज्वलन्तीं वैरोचनीं कर्मफलेषु जुष्टाम् ।  
> दुर्गां देवीं शरणमहं प्रपद्ये सुतरसि तरसे नमः ॥ 

अग्ने त्वं पारयानव्यो अस्मान्  
> स्वस्तिभिरति दुर्गाणि विश्वा \(दुर्गासूक्त\)  
> दुर्गां दुर्गतिनाशिनीम् \(दुर्गार्चन पद्धति\) 

The goddess who is worshipped mainly during *Śarannavarātrī* festival is *‘Śakti’*. *Jnānis* say that during those nine days, she should be worshiped in the form of *Lakshmī* in the first three days, *Sarasvatī* in the next set of three days, and in the form of *Pārvatī* in the last three days. Of late we are coming across many arguments pertaining to that deity which bewilder one’s mind and cause vexations in performing her *pūjā*. Here we shall discuss them briefly, and try to provide suitable answers to them.

1. “This *Durgi* is not at all an Aryan *devatā*. She was worshipped by Dravidas. The Aryans who came from outside, fought fierce wars with the Dravidians and occupied their land. In course of time the two cultures merged, and Aryans took some aspects and included them in their *Dharma* and *Samskṛti*. *Śakti* is one such goddess who was taken by the Aryans from the Dravidians.

Basically *Śakti* is not at all a deity of Aryans. Because, Aryans worshipped only male gods. Worshipping of *Matṛdevatās* is a *Dravidian* practice.

The smaller deities now, called *“grāmadevatās”* belong to the *Dravidian* pantheon” This is one of the arguments put forward by critics.

2. This *Śakti devatā* has form and qualities which are ferocious. She is a deity who consumes liquor and meat.

> सिह्मारूढायुधधरा ह्यष्टादशकरावरा।  
> सुरापानरता काचिज्जानीमो न सभर्तृका ॥ \(देवीभागवत V9-51\) 
> 
रक्षसां वानराणां वा जग्ध्वा सा मांसशोणिते ।  
> रामरावणयोर्युद्धं सप्ताहं सा न्यवर्तयत् ॥ \(कालिकापुराण 60-28\) 

*“Sāttvikas* should not worship her” is an another argument.

Let us examine these two arguments.

1. The argument that *Śakti* is the goddess of Dravidians and not that of Aryans is ridiculous. How can *devatās* be categorized as gods and goddesses of Aryans and Dravidians? They are forces residing inside of all the living beings and rule their lives. Can the wise say that they rule only the Dravidians and not Aryans?

The very classification such as Aryan deities and Dravidian deities is ridiculous and is akin to classifying the Sun as the Aryan Sun and the Dravidian sun. This theory of classification of deities has emerged from a wrong notion that the gods are the products of mere imaginations. But in reality, if *Dhyāna* and *Upāsanā* are done, all can have the visualisation of these *devatāviśeshas* is different parts of the body. This is the universal truth. The question that there are separate gods for Aryans, Dravidians and Negros does not arise here at all.

The argument that Aryans did not worship *Mātṛdevatās* is also not based on *śāstraic* truth. Because in *Sanātana Vaidic* literature, we come across praises of female deities also, like the praises of male deities such as *Indra*, *Agni, Varuṇa* etc. Both are welcome contextually. The argument that there was no prominence to female deities, just because of the fact that hymns pertaining to female deities are fewer, cannot be accepted either. Female deities such as *Aditi* and *Sarasvatī* are praised as *Parādevatās* indeed in vedic hymns.

All the worlds, all deities, all creatures and all relatives are *Aditi* herself. There is none else other than her.

> अदितिर्द्याऐरदितिरन्तक्षिरमदितिर्माता स पिता स पुत्रः ।  
> विश्वे देवा अदितिः पाजना अदितिर्जातमदितिर्जनित्वम् ॥  
\(ऋक् संहिता I-89-9-10, तै अ 1-13-2, ता. य 25-23, अथर्व 7-3-1\) 
> 
*“Sarasvatī* is not just a flowing river. She is the inspirer of all beautiful words, and noble ideas. She is invited in *yajnas* conducted by *sukṛtis*, and receives the worship. She is the *parādevatā* who grants anything desired for”—These ideas are very clearly expressed in the *Vedamantras*.

> अम्बितमे नदीतमे देवितमे सरस्वति  
> चोदयित्री सूनृतानां चेतन्ती सुमतीनाम् ।  
> यज्ञं दधे सरस्वति ॥  
> सरस्वतीं देवियन्तो हवन्ते सरस्वतीमध्वरे  
> तायमाने सरस्वतीं सुकृतो आह्व्यन्त  
> सरस्वती दाशुषे वार्यं दात्॥ \(ऋक्संहिता-10-17-7, धर्म 18-141\) 

When the *Vedas* of the *Āryamaharshis*, the most ancient literature, clearly proclaim the prominence of female goddesses, arguments such as “Female deities belong to Dravidians. Aryans worshipped only male gods. Though some female deities are seen the *Vedas*, their place is only secondary” etc, amount only to the glorification of the height of ignorance.

2. Again, to argue that *“Śakti devatā* has a ferocious form and she is worshipped with wine and meat, and therefore *Sāttviks* should not worship her, are also not the words of the wise. Though the form of some deities appear ferocious to the external eyes, they are visualized as being beautiful and bestowing bliss and peace, in deep meditation. This is not the *‘Rudrasaundarya’*, stated by some modern literateurs. It is a divine form described by *yogis* as ‘परमनयनोत्सव कारणम्’ \(a feast to the eys\)

As a matter of fact, *Parādevatās* consume only the *Amṛtānanda*. Whatever the devotees offer according to their disposition, be it fruits or flowers, vegetarian or nonvegetarian food, they get transformed into *Amṛta* and only after that they become an offering to the deities.

Though *rākshasa* and *tāmasa* devotees worship *devī* with wine and meat, *sāttvikas* should worship her with *japa, yajna* and vegetarian *naivedya* only.

> शारदी चण्डिकापूजा त्रिविधा परिगीयते ।  
> सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु ॥ 

सात्त्विकी जपयज्ञाद्यैर्नैवेद्यैश्च निरामिषैः।  
> माहात्म्यं भगवत्याश्च पुराणादिषु कीर्तितम् ।  
> सारस्तस्य जपः प्रोक्तः पठेद्देवीमनाः प्रिये।  
> राजसी बलिदानेन नैवेद्यः सामिषैस्तथा॥  
> सुरामांसाद्युपाहारैः जपयज्ञैर्विना तु या।  
> विना मन्त्रैस्तामसी स्यात् किरातानां स संमतः ॥  \(स्कान्द भविष्यपुराण\) 

Therefore the suggestion that *Sāttvikas* should not worship *Devi* stands to no reason.

So, how should the *Navarātra* of the *Śaratkāla* be celebrated? What do *śāstras* and traditions say about the religious austerities pertaining to that? We shall explain the matter briefly here.

The time of *Navarātra* of this *Śaratkāla* is the most auspicious time for the worship of God. It may be generally remembered that dispositions within and without will be most congenial for the pleasantness of the deities in this season. Much of this period should be mostly made use of for the worship of the deity in different modes such as *Dhyāna, japa, homa, Pārāyaṇa* singing of *stotras* etc. Who is the deity to be worshipped? Scriptural treatises say that it is one’s *Kuladevatā* and *Jaganmāta*, especially the one who is the form of *Lakshmī, Sarasvatī* and *Durgā*.

त्रिकालं द्विकालमेककालं वा स्वस्वकुलदेवतापूजनं सप्तशत्यादि जपः  
> इदं देवी पूजनात्मकं नवरात्रकर्म नित्यं, अकरणे दोष श्रवणात् \(धर्मसिन्धुसार\) 

The *pūjākalpas* pertaining to the worship of *Devas* and *Devīs* during these days are many. The traditions and customs of worship have many variants in different provinces. We see that During *Navarātra* the following activities generally take place in all parts of the country and in all the traditions. They are—*ŚrīmadRāmāyaṇa Pārāyaṇa*, *Pārāyaṇa* of *Saptaśatī* and other texts which contain the praise and glory of *Devī*, *Śrī Sarasvatīpūjā* on the day of *Mūlānakshatra, Durgāpūjā* in *Ashṭami, pūjā* of *Hayagrīva* the god of learning, and *ŚrīSarasvatī pūjā*, worship of musical instruments, such as *Vīṇā*, *Veṇu* and *Mṛdaṅga* and *Āyudha pūjā*, and *gajāśva pūjā* on *Mahānavamī*, special worship of all these deities and performing *maṅgala* of *Pārāyaṇa* and beginning of *Adhyayana* afresh, and especially the worship of *Devī* in *Śamī* by *Kshatriyas* and the journey for universal conquest by them \(i.e. the *kshatriyas*\) on the day of *Vijayadaśamī*.

A treatise by name *Dharma sindhu* briefly states the austerities pertaining to *Navarātra* thus:

Doing *Kuladevatā pūja* thrice, i.e. early in the morning, at noon and at *Pradoshakāla*, or twice, or atleast once, the *Pārāyaṇa* of *Saptaśatī* and other religious texts, lighting the lamp \(*nandadīpa*\) *mālābandhana*, fasting or taking food only at night, feeding *sumaṅgalīs*, feeding *kumārīs* and their worship, and chanting *saptaśatī* and other related *stotras* at the end, *mantras*, and *homas*—all these are prescribed. One should perform all these or at least a few according to *kulācāra.*

*Kalaśasthāpana* should not be done at night. If *Kalaśasthāpana* is intended to be done, a platform should be built with clean clay, and materials such as five holy sprouts, *dūrvā, Phalatāmbūla, kuṅkuma*, a lamp etc should be collected.

On *prathamā*, oil bath should be had in the morning and after wearing *punḍras* and *pavitra*, a *saṅkalpa* should be made during ten *Ghaṭikās* or in the *Abhijin muhūrta* that the *śarannavarāatramahotsava* rituals are going to be taken up. Then again with a *saṅkalpa* the following should be done viz. installation of a *kalaśa*, *Śrī Gaṇapati pūjā* for warding off obstacles, *Puṇyāhavācana Japa* and choosing *Brahmins* for *Pārāyaṇa* etc. After this the *pratishṭhā* of the idol of *Kumbhadevatā* should be done on the *purṇakumbha* which is worshipped after invoking *puṇyatīrthas* in that, God *Varuna* is worshipped. *Devī* should be invoked with the *ślokas*:—

“जयन्ती मङ्गला काली भद्रकाली कपालिनी । दुर्गा क्षमा शिवा धात्री स्वाहा स्वधा नमोऽस्तु ते” ॥ “आगच्छ वरदे देवि दैत्यदर्पनिषूदिनि । पूजां गृहाण सुमुखि नमस्ते शङ्करप्रिये,”

and *shoḍaśopacārapūjā* should be performed chanting *Ṛks* from *Purushasūkta* and *Śrīsūkta*. If *Balipradāna* is intended, *Bali* should be offered with blackgram rice or ashgourd, either every day or on the last day. The *Akhanḍanandādīpa* should be installed by chanting the śloka—

> अखण्डदीपकं देव्याः प्रीतये नवरात्रकम्।  
> उज्जवालयेदहोरात्रमेकचित्तो धृतव्रतः ॥ 

and should be lighted. *Saṅkalpa* should be made that *Canḍī Saptaśatīpāṭha, Nārāyaṇahṛdayapāṭha, Lakshmī hṛdayapāṭha* etc will be done, and *Pārāyaṇa* should be begun after worshipping *Nārāyaṇa*, *Narottamanara, SarasvatīDevī* and *Śrī Vyāsamaharshi. Oṅkara* should be uttered at the beginning and at the end. The *Pārāyaṇa* book should not be held in hand and the *parayaṇa* should not be stopped in the middle of an *adhyāya*. The *Pārāyaṇa* should be done comprehending the meaning of the treatise, and with a clear pronounciation. *Pārāyaṇa* should not be speeded up and should not be done very slowly also; and should be done with *Rasa, Bhāva* and *Svara*. It should be listened to also with devotion. The *Pārāyaṇa* of the glory of the treatise also should be done and it should also be listened to.

This should be followed by *Kumāri pūja*. One year old baby girls should not be worshipped. Nine girls aged between two and nine should be invoked with the nine names respectively viz. *Kumārī, Trimūrti, Kalyāṇī, Rohiṇī, Kālī, Canḍikā, Śāmbhavī, Durgā* and *Bhadrā* and \(*pūjā*\) should be begun. The *Pārāyaṇa* of *Bhavānī Sahasranāma* may be done.

*Navarātra* should not be performed in *Malamāsa*. If one happens to come under *Aśauca*, he should get the worship done by a Brahmin. Some experts opine that once the *vrata* is begun the devotee himself should complete it, even if he is touched by *Aśauca* in the middle.

*Upāṅga Lalitādevī* should be worshipped on the fifth day.

On the day of *Mūlānakshatra*, Goddess *ŚrīSarasvatī* should be invoked in books and worshipped. *Sarasvatī* is invoked in *Mūlānakshatra*, and worshipped in *Pārishāḍha*; *Bali pradāna* is done in *Uttarāshāḍha* and she is given a send off in *Śravaṇa*.

On *Mahāshṭami* a special *pūja* should be offered to *Durgā Devī*. If the day happens to be a Tuesday it is specially auspicious. If one cannot perform the *pūjā* for some reasons, he should get it done by others. If one cannot offer *shodaśopacāra pūjā* in detail, at least the *pañcopacāra pūjā* should be performed with *gandha, pushpa, dhūpa, dīpa* and *Naivedya*.

*Homa* should be performed on *Mahānavamī*, either with the *Durgā navākshara mantra* “जयन्ती मङ्गलम्” or with the *śloka* “नमो देव्यै महादेव्यै”, and hymns from *Dūrgā saptaśatī* etc. This *homa* should be perfomed with the Pāyasa which has ghee as an ingredient and which is mixed with white gingelly, or, with the *Pāyasa* that is mixed with materials such as only white gingelly, *Durvā, Muḷḷumuttugada hūvu* \(bastard teak\), mustard areca, *yava, bilva* fruit, pieces of red sandal etc. *Homa* should be performed in numbers equivalent to ten times the number of *Japa* done. *Brahmins* should offer *Bali* only with the following:-Cooked rice with blackgram, ashgourd, *Pishtapaśu* \(Images of animals made of rice flour\) etc. They should never sacrifice a live animal.

Kings should worship the royal insignia like *chatra* and *cāmara*, weapons, elephants, horses and musical instruments like drums etc. Those who breed horses, even if they do not happen to be the rulers, perform *Vājinīrājana* to the horses starting from the day in which the star *svāti* prevails, or from *Dvitīya,* and conclude it on *navamī*. \(Some, however, bathe and worship the horses only on *Vijayadaśamī* day\)

\(The divine horse\) *Ucchaiśravas* should be invoked in an idol and after worshipping the deities, the horses ahead should be worshipped and offered *Upacāras*.

*Kshatriyas* should pray the horses saying—“You are born in the *gandharva* clan. Therefore do not betray your tribe. Multiply your progeny by the power of the words of *Brahma*, *Soma* and *Varuṇa* and by the influence of *Agnideva*. In battles defeat the enemies and live happily with your master”

The *Vrata* should be concluded on *dasamī* with *Pāraṇa* on *daśamī*.

On the day of *Vijayadaśamī*, the following should be performed:- *Aparājitā devī pūjā*, crossing the boundary of thee villages or cities, *Sīmollaṅghana*, *śamīpūja*, and going out for travelling abroad, and the Journey of conquest.

In the afternoon, *Aparājita pūjā* should to be done in a clean place in the northeast part of the village. *Aparājitadevī* should be invoked in the middle, and to her right and left, *Jayādevī* and *Vijayādevī* should be invoked with the *mantras* “क्रियाशक्त्यै नमः” and “उमायै नमः” respectively, and all the three should be offered *shoḍaśopacāras*.

After that, all should proceed to the *Śamī* tree which is outside the village in the north eastern direction and worship it. *Simollaṅghana* should be done either before or after *Śamīpūjā*.

If *Śamī* tree is not available, the *Aśmantaka* tree \(*Keṅgāñcālada mara*\) should to be worshipped.

The *pūjāmantra* of *Śamī* is

“अमङ्गलानां शमनीं शमनीं दुष्कृतस्य च ।  
> दुःखप्रणाशिनीं धन्यां प्रपद्येहं शमीं शुभाम्” 

“O\! *Śamīdevi*\! You are the one who wards off all inauspiciousness.

“You are the redeemer of sins. You are the one who puts an end to all sorrows. You are virtuous and you bring auspiciousness. I surrender to you”. After the *pūjā* is over, a prayer should be utterred as follows:—

> \(शमी शमयते पापं शमी लोहितकण्टका,  
> धरित्र्यर्जुनबाणानां रामस्य प्रियवादिनी,  
> करिष्यमाण यात्रायां यथाकालं सुखं मया,  
> तत्र निर्विघ्‌नअकर्त्री त्वं भव श्रीरामपूजिते”\) 

*“Śamī* redeems all the sins. She is adorned with red thorns. She is the tree who safely kept and guarded *Arjuna’s* weapons. She spoke lovingly to *ŚrīRāma*. Let there be happiness at proper times in the journey I am going to make. Please ward off all obstacles. O\! *Śamī Devi* you were worshipped by *ŚrīRāma”*. If *Śamī* tree is not available and if *Keṅgāñcāla* tree is to be worshipped, it should be prayed with the *śloka*

“आश्मन्तकमहावृक्ष महादोषनिवारण,  
> इष्टानां दर्शनं देहि शत्रूणां च विनाशनम्” 

\(O great *Aśmantaka mahāvṛksha*\! you are the redeemer of big blemishes. Bless me so that the dear ones are seen and the enemies are destroyed\) After this, it is generally seen that some lay persons cut the branches of *Śamī* and take them home. This has no consent in the *Śāstras*. And then, only the wet bed soil of *Śamī* tree mixed with *Akshatā* should be taken home along with *Maṅgalavādyas*. New clothes should be put on with relatives and friends, and *ārati* should be had. Those going abroad, should start their journey in the *muhūrta* called *‘Vijaya*\!”

There are two types in the *Vijaya muhūrta*.

1. The time a little after dusk when stars appear in the sky and 
2. The Eleventh *muhūrta*. 

Both are auspicious, but the day should not be an *Ekādaśī*. It should be *daśamī* only. If there is *Śravaṇa nakshatra*, it is still more auspicious. This is the most auspicious time for all endeavours and especially to begin a journey.

“अश्वयुक् शुक्लदशमी विजयाख्याखिले शुभा ।  
> प्रयाणे तु विशेषेण किं पुनः श्रवणान्विता” ।। 

If *Navarātra pūjā* is intended to be begun on *Pāḍya, Saṅkalpa* should be made on the same day and the *kalaśa* should be installed. It should be filled with pure water and sprouts of great trees like Mango should be placed inside, and *Devī* should be worshipped with *Shoḍaśopacāras*. Sandal paste, *Āmalaka* and comb should be offered to *Devī*. And to the extent possible cosmetics and jewels etc such as Silk thread, *Agaru*, turmeric, *kuṅkuma*, *Madhuparka, tilaka, Añjana, Śrīgandhalepa*, and *aṅgarāga* and jewels should be offered. If the *pūja* is to be begun on the sixth day, installation of the *kalaśa* should to be done near a *bilva* tree in the morning and, that tree itself should be worshipped as *Durgādevī*. \(A prayer should be uttered as follows:-

“O holy *bilva* tree, in order to bless *ŚrīRāma* who had destroyed *Rāvaṇa*, Lord *Brahma* awakened *Devī* in you at an odd time. In the same way I am also chanting *suprabhāta* to you. You are born in *ŚrīŚaila* and you are the abode of *ŚrīDevi*, O\! *Śrīphala*\!, Now I have to take you now and worship you in the form of *Durgā”*.

> ऐं रावणस्य वधार्थाय रामस्यानुग्रहाय च ।  
> अकाले ब्रह्मणा बोधः देव्या त्वयि कृतः पुरा ॥ 

> अहमप्याश्विने षष्ठ्यां सायाह्ने बोधयाम्यतः ।  
> श्रीशैलशिखरेजात श्रीफल श्रीनिकेतन।  
> नेतव्योसि मया गच्छ पूज्यो दुर्गास्वरूपतः॥ 

Afterwards, the holy abode of *Devī* should be prayed in good clay, *Śrīgandhalepa*, stone, coriander seeds, *dūrvā darbhā*, flowers, fruits, curds, ghee, *svastika*, *candana, śankha, añjana, gorocana*, mustard, gold, silver, copper, *cāmara,* mirror and plate should be prayed. Then reaching the *Durgā pūjā manṭapa, acamana* should be done and nine leaves from the trees of plantain, pomegranate etc should be tied with the *aparājitā* creeper.

Then worship should be offered to the bundle of those nine leaves and the idol of *Durgā*. *Devī* should be installed in the *Bilva Vṝksha* along with *Śrīgandha* and other holy things. Then the idol of *ŚrīDurgā* and a twig of *bilva* should be taken home and worshipped.

On the seventh day, reaching that *bilva vṛksha, pūjā* should be performed and a prayer should be made thus: O\! tree\! you are very dear to Lord *Śaṅkara*, I am worshipping *Durgā* in the twig I took from you. Do not suffer pain because I have cut a twig from you. O king among *vṛkshas*, Salutations to you”. Then a twig not well grown, either on the south western side or on the north westernside of the tree, and not laden with flowers and fruits should be cut and brought home, and coming to the *Manṭapa* it should be placed on the *Pīṭha*. white mustard seeds should be scattered there to driveout evil *bhūtas*. Then black gram with cooked rice should be offered to *Kaḷidevī* who is surrounded by *Bhūtas*. The bundle of nine leaves should be worshipped and *Cāmunḍādevī* should be worshipped in that *Bilva* branch also. \(*Kadalī, daḍimī, dhānya, haridrā, Māṇaka, kacu, bilva, aśoka* and *jayantī* are the nine leaves.\) The *kalaśa* should be installed, and the bundle of leaves and the five deities should be worshipped. Now the idol of *Devī* should be placed on the *pīṭha* to the tune of music and the bundle of leaves should be placed to its right. The *bilva* twig should placed in a copper vessel and the *prāṇapratishṭhā* of *Devī*, *Gaṇeśa* and other *parivāra devatās* should be performed. Then, holding flowers and *akshatā* in hand, the divine form of goddess should be meditated upon as follows:—

“She has matted hair, the crecsent moon is an ornament on her head, *Devī* has three eyes, her face is brilliant like the lotus and moon. Like refined gold, she is shining with radiance. She is effulgent with rich beauty, beautiful eyes, the lustre of fresh youth and with the adornment of all the divine ornaments. Her very looks are beautiful. She shines with noble and breasts. She is endowed with the imposing *tribhaṅgi* posture. The *Jaganmātā* has ten soft and long arms which look like lotus stalks. Among those, She has the trident on her right hand and below that she is holding a sword and a discuss respectively, She holds sharp arrows and the weapon *Śakti*. In the left hand she has the shield, a bent bow, *pāśa* and *aṅkuśa* at the top, and below them she is holding a bell and an axe”. Beneath her, demon *Mahisha* with his head cut and the part of the body which holds a sword, should be meditated upon. That demon should be supposed as pierced in the heart by the trident, with protruding teeth, his body drenched in blood and red eyes. He is bound by the *Nāgapāśa* and is seen having knotted eyebrows. *Durgādevī* holding a *Pāśa* in her hand is seizing him by his tuft. The lion, her vehicle, is sucking the demons’ blood and spewing it. Devi’s right foot is placed evenly on the back of ths lion. Her left toe is placed on *Mahishāsura* just above that.

The worshipper wearing a flower on his head and holding flowers and *akshatā* in his hand, should invoke *Devī* in the twig of *Bilva* and pray her for long life, health and progency. *Upacāras* such as *āsana, arghya, pādya* etc should be offered. She should be worshipped in the bundle of nine leaves also. She should be offered *upacāras* in the *kalaśa* also and should be offered a black male buffalo as a *bali*. The animals to be offered as *bali* to *Śrī Durgā* and *Bhairava* are - a male buffalo, tortoise, crocodile, fish, five types of deer and he-goat, etc. Female animals should not be offered as *bali*. The animal offered as *bali* should not be a one which is physically handicapped. Male buffaloes and he-goats are the main sacrificial animals. Liquour should be offered to God. A *Brāhmin* should not offer *Paśubali*. He can offer ashgourds and such other objects instead of animals. Instead of liquor, he should offer tender coconut water, or honey in a bronze vessel. All can offer worship to the goddess with these *sāttvik* things only.

On the day of *Mahāshṭami*, after doing *Ācamana*, *Prāṇāyāma* and *Mantranyāsa*, the worshipper should sprinkle *śankha tīrtha* on himself and *pūjādravyas*. After that, *Devī* should be meditated upon in the abovesaid manner, and then the *Mānasapūjā* should be offered. Then the external worship should be offered. Her retinue deities should also be worshipped to one’s capability, and *aṅgapūjā* should be offered. *Mahāshṭamī* is a day of fasting. But an *upāsaka* having sons should take *havishyānna* etc in the night, instead of fasting.

On that day *pūjā* should be offered to *Brahmins* and unmarried girls. If it is not possible to worship them every day, they should be worshipped at least on *Durgāshṭami*. The age of the girls should be from two to ten years in a progressive order. These nine girls should be worshipped as the forms of *Navadevīs* viz *kumārikā, Trimūrti, Kalyāṇī, Rohiṇī, Kāḷī, Canḍikā, Śāmbhavī, Durgā* and *Subhadrā* respectively. These girls should not have any blemish such as defective limbs etc.

During *Navarātri* the worshipper himself should do *veda Pārāyaṇa*, *canḍīpāṭha*, *japa* and *homa*. Or he must get it done by others. At the end of the *pūjā*, members of his family and relatives and friends should receive the *prasāda*. *Homa* should be done after the *pūja*.

On *Mahānavamī, pūja* should be performed on the lines of the precepts for *Mahāshṭamī*. But on that day the number of *balis* is more. If possible, *homa* with one hundred and eight *āhutis* should be performed. A special *nīrājana* to *Devī* should be done. *Ṛtviks* should be given the necessary *dakshiṇā*. The *Jaganmātā* should be prayed to pardon for any *apacāras* committed during the *pūjā* knowingly or unknowingly. Then the *Kanyās* and *Brahmins* should be worshipped and their blessings should be obtained.

On *daśamī, Devī* should be specially worshipped with *shoḍaśopacāra pūjā*. And the idol of *devī*, the *bilva* twig and the bundle of nine leaves should be placed in a different place and worship should be offered to them separately there. To the accompaniment of music and *vedaghosha*, they should be taken to a river or a lake and the idol of *Devī* should be immersed in water. She should be prayed with the words “O *Durgā Devi*, O *Jaganmāta*\! please go to your original place. Come back again for the *pūjā* of next year”.

*Vijayadaśamī* is one of the most auspiciousdays in a year. *Sarasvatīpūjā* and *Vidyārambha* are done on that day. The most important *pūjās* done on that day are *Aparājithā pūjā, Śamī pūjā. Sīmollaṅghana* etc. Putting on new clothes and worshipping of elephants and horses are also there. *Vijayadaśamī* is auspicious for all classes of people. It has special significance to *Kshatrīyas*.

*Aparājitā Devī* should be worshiped at a purified place in the north eastern part of the village. *Vijayā* and *Jayā Devīs* should be worshipped on her left and right. Those *devīs* are called *Kriyāśakti* and *Umā*.

Later the *Śamī* tree which is in the north eastern part of the village should be reached and worshipped. There is a custom of worshipping *Rāma* and *Sītā* also on that day.

*Śamī* should be prayed with the words

“I surrender to *Śamī* which drives away inauspicious forces, which redeems sins and destroys all bad dreams”

“अमङ्गलानां शमनीं शमनीं दुष्कृतस्य च ।  
> दुःस्वप्ननाशिनीं धन्यां प्रपद्येहं शमीं शुभाम्”॥ 

“This \(tree\) redeems our sins. It is brilliant with red thorns. It is the holy tree which bore \(i.e. safeguarded\) *Arjuna’s* weapons for a year. It is the tree which spoke pleasantly to *ŚrīRāma*. It is a great tree. Let it remove all the hurdles on the way of my universal conquest journey and make me happy. This tree is worshipped by *ŚrīRāma*. O *Śamī Devi*, I prostrate before you”.

> शमी शमयते पापं शमी लोहितकण्टका।  
> धारिण्यर्जुनबाणानां रामस्य प्रियवादिनी॥  
> करिष्यमाणयात्रायां यथाकालं सुखं मया।  
> तत्र निर्विघ्‌नअकर्त्री त्वं भव श्रीरामपूजिते॥ 

If *Śamī* tree is not available, the *ashmāntaka* should prayed and worshipped.

A small quantity of mud should be taken from the bottom of that tree and \(holding it\) with *Akshatā*, it should be brought home to the accompaniment of music and dance, and after the *Ārati* is done to it; and new clothes should be put on.

*Kshatrīyas* sometimes resort to *abhicāra prayoga* \(*maddu-māṭa*\) \(setting evil forces\) on their enemies on that day. *Śamī* leaves and *mṛttika* \(the soil on which the tree stands\) are sentimentally considered as gold and are distributed among themselves are *prasāda*. In the festival of *Navarātra*, the glory of *ŚrīRāma* is praised for all the ten days, and joy is experienced with *abhinaya* etc also. On the last day the evil demon, *Rāvaṇa’s* effigy is burnt symbolising his slaying.

We have to give a satisfactory explanation regarding an important question which is raised pertaining to those various forms of worship.

Now regarding the *Paśubali* prescribed in *Devipūjā* during *śarannavarātra*.

Animal sacrifice is prescribed not only in *Durga pūjā* but also in *yajnas* and *gṛhya karmas* which are stated in the *Kalpasūtras*. For example, in the *Aśvamedha yajna* the *yajnaśva* is sacrificed and it is well known that in certain marriages *madhuparka* with meat are prescribed by the *śāstras*. But we see that the *paśubali* is specially proclaimed during the *Durgapūjā*, which is evident in the *pūraṇas* and *Āgamatantrās*.

		
They declare that offering of the following is very dear to the deity:—

Fish, Crocodiles, rams, he goats, buffaloes, male buffaloes, rhinos, *Śarabhās*, lions, tigers, pigs, deer, birds, one’s own blood and lastly even human beings offerred as bali.

> न तथा बलिदानेन पुष्पधूपविलेपनैः।  
> यथा सन्तुष्यते मेध्यैर्महिषैर्विन्ध्यवासिनी ॥  
> अजश्च महिषश्चैव नरश्चैव यथा क्रमात्।  
> बलिर्महाबलिश्चातिबलिश्चेति प्रकीर्तिताः॥  
> पक्षिणः कच्छपा ग्राहाः मत्स्या नवविधा मताः।  
> महिषो गवयश्चैव छागो बभ्रुश्च सूकरः ॥  
> खड्गश्च कृष्णसारश्च गोभिका शरभो हरिः ।  
> शार्दूलश्च नरश्चैव स्वगात्ररुधिरं तथा॥ 

It is natural that some compassionate pious people, touched by this, revolt against injustice and say—“How cruel it is\! that Slaying of animals and bloodshed are prescribed in the worship of Gods\! What an *Adharma*\!”

“Sir, If *Paśubali* is performed, those *Paśus* obtain *Sadgati*. For their own good they are given as *bali* to Gods” - Some say.

> न वा एतन्म्रियसे नरिष्यसि, देवा, इदेषि पथिभिः सुगेभिः \(ऋ I-112\)  
> ओषध्यः पशवो वृक्षास्तिर्यः पक्षिणस्तथा ।  
> यज्ञार्थं निधनं प्राप्ताः प्राप्नुवन्त्युत्तमां गतिम् ॥  \(मनु V-42\) 

> एष्वर्थेषु पशून् हिंसन् वेदतत्वार्थवित् द्विजः।  
> आत्मानं च पशुं चैव गमयत्युत्तमां गतिम्॥ 

> मधुपर्के च यज्ञे च पितृदैवतकर्मणि।  
> अत्रैव पशवो हिंस्या नान्यत्रेत्यब्रवीन्मनुः॥\(मनु V-48\) 

Those who defend the *Vaidika Yajnas* try to reply as follows: “The *śrutis* and *smṛtis* approve it. Therefore compassion is hidden in this *Paśubali* indeed” But that reply is met with ridicule and derision.

“What is the proof to show that the sacrificed animals reach heaven? Instead of showing compassion to some animals let them show that compassion on their aged parents, sacrifice them and send them to heaven”.

‘स्वपिता यजमानेन हन्यताम्’

“Your gods have an eye on poor animals only. because horses are not sacrificed in *yajnas*. Elephants are not sacrificed. Tigers, will never be sacrificed. Alas\! The lamb, a dumb and harmless animal is given as *bali*\!”

> अश्वं नैव गजं नैव व्याघ्‌रअं नैव च नैव च।  
> अजापुत्रं बलिं दद्यात् देवो दुर्बलघातकः॥ 

Thus also, some people attack the animal sacrifice \(They have not taken note of the fact that there are *yajnatantras* also in which horses, lions and tigers are sacrificed.

There are scriptural statements which are quite contradictory. Sometimes the animal sacrifice is enjoined. Sometimes it is totally barred. Some people may do it and some others may not. On some occasions it may be done and on other occasions it should not be done. This increases the confusion. For example *“Uparicaravasumahārāja* performed an *Aśvamedha yāga,* and there was no animal sacrifice in it at all, because he was a lover of nonviolence, he was pure, large hearted and unattatched”.

		
> तस्य यज्ञो महानासीत् अश्वमेधो महात्मनः।  
> न तत्र पशुघातोभूत् स राजैवं स्थितोभवत् ॥ शान्तिपर्व 336/10-12 

“This is the best *kṛta yuga*. Animal sacrifice should never take place in this *yuga*. How can killing of animals be *dharma*, O *devatās*?”

> नैष धर्मः सतां देवा यत्र वध्येत वै पशुः ।  
> इदं कृतयुगं श्रेष्ठं कथं वध्येत वै पशुः ॥ शान्तिपर्व 337-5 

Again, the *Mahābhārata* says: “He-goats and rams should not be sacrificed in *Yajnas”* Then how is that the *Śrutis* say that *yajnas* have to be performed with he-goats?. Here *aja* does not mean a he-goat. It means old seeds which have lost the potency to germinate. They are called *‘ajas’*. The correct meaning of that *Śrutivākya* is that *homa* should be performed with them. It is not proper to sacrifice he-goats and rams without understanding the correct meaning”. And, the *Mahābhārata* clearly prohibits *Paśubali* in *Yajnas.*

> बीजैर्यज्ञेषु यष्टव्यं इति वै वैदिकी श्रुतिः ।   
> अजसंज्ञानि बीजानि छागं नो हन्तुमर्हथ॥ \(शान्ति 337-4\) 

“Only in *a yajna* one can consume meat and not in other occasions”.

> यज्ञाय जग्धिर्मांसस्येत्येष दैवो विधिः स्मृतः ।  
> अतोsन्यत्र प्रवृत्तिस्तु राक्षसो विधिरुच्यते ॥ \(मनु \[v-3\) 

> मधुपर्के च यज्ञे च पितृदैवतकर्मणि।  
> अत्रैव पशवो हिंस्या नान्यत्रेत्यब्रवीन्मनुः॥ \(मनु \[न-48\) 

\(Some *smṛtis* say that violence on animals is permitted in *Madhuparka, yajna, pitṛkarma* and *daivakarma* only, and it should never be done on other occasions.\)

According to *Kālikāpurāṇa*, only some people are permitted to sacrifice certain chosen animals.

> न कदाचिन्महादेव्यै प्रदद्याद्धयहस्तिनौ ।  
> सिह्मव्याघ्‌रअनरान् हत्वा ब्राह्मणो नरकं व्रजेत्।  
> स्वगात्ररुधिरं दत्वा आत्मवध्यामवाप्नुयात् ।  
> मद्यं दत्वा ब्राह्मणस्तु ब्राह्मण्यादेव हीयते ॥  
> न कृष्णसारं वितरेत् बलिं तु क्षत्रियाधिकः॥ 

\(Elephants and horses should never be offered as *balis* to *Mahādevī*. If lions, tigers and human beings are sacrificed, Brahmins go to hell. If one gives blood from his own body in a sacrifice, he subjects himself to the sin of committing suicide. If a Brahmin offers liquor \(in a sacrifice\) his brahminism itself gets destroyed. *Kshatrīyas* and others should not sacrifice a breed of deer called *Kṛshṇasāra*.\)

The *Devipurāṇa* says that no female animal, be it a beast or a bird, should be offered as sacrifice to *Devī*. If one does it, he is sure to go to hell.

		
> पशूनां पक्षिणां वापि नराणां च विशेषतः ।  
> स्त्रियं न दद्यात्तु बलिं दत्त्वा नरकमाप्नुयात्॥ 

Why is this exception to females? - this is the question here. The *Kaḷikāpurāṇa* says—

“Instead of offering animals as sacrifices, ashgourd, sugar cane staffs, liquor or *āsavas* can be offered. Animal images made of flours may be offered. Imagined forms of *Paśus* can be offered. Coconut water or even honey can be offered instead of liquor”.

> कूष्माण्डमिक्षुदण्डं च मद्यमासवमेव च ।  
> एते बलिसमाः प्रोक्ताः तृप्तौ छागसमास्सदा॥  
> छागैश्च महिष्यैश्चैव कूष्माण्डैरपि भावतः ।  
> कृत्वा पिष्टमयैर्वापि बलिना तं समर्पयेत् ॥  
> नारिकेलैर्बीजपूरैः जम्बीरैनिम्बुजातिभिः ।  
> महार्घैरर्पयेच्चैनां न वन्ध्यां तां निशां नयेत्॥ 

“Can we offer animals as sacrifice to gods? *Śāstras* offer various kinds of opinions; some in favour of the practice and some against it. And, some concessions are offered to some people. Why is this so?” - To this question, some reply as follows:-

“It was common among ancient Aryans to offer meat as *naivedya* to gods. They were under the impression that *tiryak* animals \(the ones which walk horizontally unlike humans who walk straight\) like sheep, buffaloes etc. have no *cetana*. And only humans are *cetanas*. Therefore if this *tiryak* animal is killed it won’t be a sin”. Later, by the influence of Buddhism and Jainism, the *samskāra* of nonviolence spread in them also. And they started preaching that *yajnas* should be performed with grains, fruits and cow produces only. This is the Hindu literature of the Post *Jaina Bauddha* period”.

This explanation is not correct. Because, Vedic *Maharshis* knew very well that even birds, beasts and plants are *cetanās* and *Vedas* themselves provide evidence for this. The *Ṛgveda* says that the cow is the mother of *Rudra* and the daughter of *vasus*. \(माता रुद्राणां दुहिता वसूनाम्\). *Yajurveda* makes the following prayer addressing the *darbhas*:—

\(“मात्वान्वक्, मा तिर्यक् पर्वतेराध्यासमाच्छेत्ता ते मारिषम्”\) “I shall do not cut you crosswise, I shall not cause pain to your knots. I shall collect you as per precepts, for the purpose of *yajna*. Please do not cause my destruction” *Smṛtis* have set procedures for collecting *darbha* and *Tulasi*. One has to salute them before collecting them, get their permission and collect only the quantity necessary for the *yajna* or *pūja*. Therefore the argument that the Aryans were under the impression that tiryak animals have no *cetana* at all is not correct. There was no need for Hindus to learn the concept of non-violence from Buddhists and Jains who came at a later time. The *Vedas* themselves proclaim

\(न च हिंस्यात्सर्वाभूतानि”\)

“No animal should be subjected to pain”. This very idea was preached with emphasis in the *Jaina* and *Bauddha matas* which came later. *Jains* are *‘ahimsāśūras’*. They over argue the case. Even though *Buddhists* condemn the killing of animals in sacrifices and make heroic vows in this regard, they are non-vegetarians in practice.. They argue “We do not kill animals. We eat the meat of the animals killed by others and it is not a sin”. They have forgotten the ordinary truth that those who eat meat cause the killing of animals \(at least\) indirectly though not directly. Thus, it is only in vedic culture the matter of violence and non-violence is given a discerning thought and norms which are practicable have been preached.

The *Manusmrti* says “One has to live a life without causing pain to any animal. If it is not possible, violence should be limited to the minimum and violence may be resorted to only when it is unavoidable. “अद्रोहेणैव भूतानां अल्पद्रोहेण वा पुनः” As is evident from “जीवो जीवस्य भोजनम्” no creature can live without consuming another as food. Whether the food consumed is vegetarian or nonvegetarian, life cannot go on without violence. This is because even plants are *cetanas*. But this *caitanyaŚakti* will be more in animals than in plants. It will be still more in human beings. Among men it will be very high in *jnānis*. Therefore violence on animals is more sinful than violence on plants. Violence on human beings is still more sinful. And it becomes clear that causing pain to a *brahmajnāni* is the worst type of a sin. Therefore *maharshis* preached that vegetarian food is better than non-vegetarian food. which is obtained by killing *tiryak* animals.

Our sages knew that even while preparing vegetarian food, pain was definitely being caused to living beings. To offset this, they prescribed the *pañcamahāyajnās*. Worship of gods and serving guests also come under *pañchamahāyajnās*. \(A stone mortar, a stove, a grinding stone, sweeping, cleansing the ground and collecting water—At these five places unavoidable pain is caused. These are called *Pañcasūnāsthānas*. In order to get relieved of this *Sūnādosha*, the *gṛhasthas* have prescribed the performing of *Brahmanyajnā, Devayajna, Pitṛyajna*. *Bhūtayajna* and *Manushya yajna* \(*atithi pūjā*\) by the *śāstras*\). Thus, preparing food in this *yajnarūpa* and consuming it causes no sin. As all the things used in this process are offered to God, *sadgati* shall be there say the *śāstras*.

“यज्ञार्थं पशवः सृष्टाः” It is the good fortune of *dravyas* if they happen to be of use in a *yajna*.

It is already stated above that vegetarian food is better than non vegetarian food. But there will be not blemish if non-vegetarians offer to God the food they eat before consuming it.

On the other hand, if they do not do so, more blemish is caused. Whatever is the food for a person, the same will be the food for his deities also.

“यदन्नःपुरुषो भवति तदन्नास्तस्य देवताः” It is propitious for him to consume \(it as\) *devatāprasāda*.

Eating meat is not a great sin, but to give it up is most great, says *Manu*.

> न मांसभक्षणे दोषः न मद्ये न च मैथुने।  
> प्रवृत्तिरेषा भूतानां निवृत्तिस्तु महाफला ॥ 

Among *vaidika maharshis* not all were non-vegetarians. There was a large number of vegetarians also among them. Even with regard to the non-vegetarians, there was a rule that *brahmacāris*, *vānaprasthas* and *sanyāsis* should not eat meat. Even those who ate meat, were bound by certain rules which stated that they should not eat meat on certain days of a week; Even while eating they should do it in the form of a *yajna*, and that they should eat only after *devatā pūja* and the offering of *dānas*. On the whole, when we study the *śāstras*, we understand that our *maharshis* as a rule favoured the conduct of totally abstaining from meat, or partially abstaining and restricting it’s consumption.

In the *Itihāsa* and *purāṇas* we read the description of the great *yajnas* that were performed by our *jnāni-maharshis*. Some of them did involve animal sacrifice. “Wasn’t violence caused to animals on such occasions?”—This question comes up naturally. If violence is going to be caused to *Yajna Paśus* in a sacrifice by the performers, such persons should not take up a *yajna* at all. If they perform *yajna* in that way, they will become sinners even if they chant *vedamantras*, *śāstras* say. This is because, *yajna* is also called *‘adhvara’* which means non-violence. So, any activity which causes violence can never be a *yajna*. A *yajna* will be acceptable to *śāstras* only if both i.e. the *yajamāna* who performes the *yajna* without causing any violence, and the *yajnadravya* \(i.e.the animal sacrificed\) are led to *sadgati*.

How can a *yajnaPaśu* like a horse or a goat can attain *sadgati*? As they are not endowed with *jnāna* like men, they cannot obtain *Sadgati* by their own accomplishments. But if the person who performs a *yajna* happens to be a *brahmajnāni*, he can help the animal attain *Sadgati* by the power of his penance. If a person without such a power claims that he can provide *sadgati* to the animal he sacrifices in a *yajna*, it is like a man promising others to take them across a river, while he himself remains unable to cross it.

“स्वयं तरितुमक्षमः किमितरानसौ तारयेत्”. The *yajna* he performs will only be a *Yajna* in name only culminating only in the violence of killing the animal.

“Let us assume for a moment that a *maharshi* who is a *jnāni* can make the *yajnaPaśu* obtain *sadgati* by the power of his penance. But, does not the animal suffer from pain when it is being sacrificed?” No. Because he possesses a power by which he can provide a divine state to that animal in which no pain is caused. ***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* used to give the analogy of \(a doctor\) conducting a surgery after administering chloroform to the patient.** By this, not only the person undergoing surgery does not experience any pain, but also regains energy after the surgery.

If persons who do not possess such powers happen to offer a *Paśubali*, it will end up only as a mockery of a *yajna*. Instead of *‘Adhvara’* it becomes a *‘dhvara’* and instead of *Sadgati*, only *durgati* is caused \(to the animal\).

We have thus given a long explanation to the *Paśubaliyajna* that was being performed by a few *Mahātmas* in the past. Even then, *jnanis* say that a *yajna* performed with a *Paśu* in the form of a *Sasyadravya* is better than a *yajna* done with *Paśu*, and *jnānyajna* is better than *dravyayajna*. “श्रेयान् द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञात् ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप”

Even in a *Paśubali yajna*, a *Paśu* selected randomly cannot be selected. The *Paśu* which has the capacity to procreate is forbidden. It should not be taken by force. It should come happily on its own. If an animal without these features is forcibly brought and sacrificed, it will lead to only undesirable results.

The *Paśu* used in *Devīpūjā*, be it an bird or an animal, should always be a male. It should never be a female, say the *śāstras*. “स्त्रियं न दद्यात्तु बलिं दत्वा नरकमाप्नुयात्” What is the reason for this rule? Some people put forth the argument saying that *Devī* is a female deity and so it amounts to an offence against her if a female animal is offered as a *bali*. It is not right. Because, this leads to the conclusion that a male animal should not be sacrificed as a *bali* in the \(*yajna* of a\) male deity, and only a female animal should be given as a bali. Only the rules in the *śāstras* can provide the discrimination to decide which animal’s body \(male or female\) is *Bhogya* to a particular deity and the disposition that is caused thereby to obtain the grace of a particular deity.

One more important thing has to be noted here. There is no hard and fast rule that all should offer a *Paśubali* in the worship of *Durgādevī*. Animal sacrifice is done only in *Rājas*a and *Tāmasapūjās*. In a *sāttvika pūjā*, worship gets accomplished with mere *Sasyadravyas*. *Sāttvikapūja* alone is the best.

> सात्त्विकैर्जपयज्ञाद्यैः नैवेद्यैश्च निरामिषैः।  
> माअत्म्यंभगवत्याश्च पुराणादिषु कीर्तितम् ॥  
> पाठस्तस्य जपः प्रोक्तः पठेद्देवीमनाः प्रिये।  
> राजस्य बलिदानेन नैवेद्यैः सामिषैस्तथा॥  
> सुरामांसाद्युपाहारैः जपयज्ञैर्विना तु या।  
> विना मन्त्रैस्तामसी स्यात् किरातानां च सम्मताः॥ \(स्कान्द-भविष्य\) 

In *sāttvika pūjās*, deliberations like *japa yajna* etc will be more. *Naivedya* will be only of vegetarian items. Here *japa* means *Pārāyaṇa* of *Devimāhātmya* with devotion and concentration as stated in the *purāṇas*. In *Rājasapūjās*, *Paśubali* will be there. The *naivedya* offered will be some items with meat. In *Tāmasapūjās* it is all liquor and meat. There will be no *japa yajnas* in it.

But, in a *tāttvika* sense, *Paśubali* will be very much there even in all *Sāttvika devatā pūjās*. Inside us, well fed beasts in the form of *Kāma* and *Krodha* etc are roaming freely. Those who sacrifice them and please the deity shall become *Mahātmas* indeed endowed with *Ātmaguṇas*. To put in a nutshell, it is best to perform *Devīpūjā* without *Paśubali*.

But if the non-vegetarians offer a *Paśu* endowed with suitable features in the prescribed manner with faith and devotion, it wont be a sinful act. But everyone has to sacrifice the beasts of *kama* and *Krodha* etc. in the worship of *Devī*. Otherwise *Devī* will not be pleased. *Yajna* performed of that kind which pleases *Jaganmātā* is the best. Because, it makes us qualified for the *Jnānayajna* itself.

“It is true that in *Rājasapūjās* offered to *Devī*, animal sacrifice is prescribed. It is not proper to redicule—“Does *Devi* eat meat and such other items like sediment offered to her?” Certainly she does not eat them. She does not eat *laddus* or *jilebis* either. She is always full of bliss and blesses the devotees with their desires. The devotees of *sāttvika, Rājasa* and *tāmasa* dispostions worship her in a way natural to them. The type of *Bali* prescribed above is decided on what should be the *Naivedya* and the appropriate *prasāda* for a particular form worship, and what fosters the accomplishment of desires. This should be noted with discernment. What authority do we have to make a rule that all devotees should do only *sāttvika pūja*.

This discussion regarding *Paśubali*, though a little elaborate and digressive, has been presented here with a view that it will be useful in understanding the science of similar *vaidik* and *tāntrik* worships.

As part of this *Vrata*, the *vṛksha pūjā* is an important aspect which has been criticized much. And so, we would like to discuss it here,

Question 1: “The *ĀryaBhāratīyamaharshis* were mainly worshippers of nature. They were influenced by the thunder, lightning, rains, wind, light etc. which occur in nature and stir up feelings like fear, wonder, jubiliation etc. and so, attributing divinity to them, they began to worship them with prayers and sacrifices. The worship of trees also comes under this category. Gigantic trees attracted them. They were attracted by their produce such as shade, flowers, fruits and medicines and furniture, and firewood made from their timber. The houses of *Vaidik* Aryans were generally built with timber only. In the *Viśvakarma Sūkta* in the *Vedas*, we come across a sentence:-

“किग्ग्ंस्विद्वनं क उ स वृक्ष आसीद्यतो द्यावापृथिवी निफतक्षुः”

which means—“from which forest and from which trees did *Viśvakarma* build this world?”

Thus, the vedic *Ṛshis* began to worship the trees which made an impact on their hearts as deities. The same tradition continues in Indians even in this twentieth century” This is the opinion of most of the western critics. Many Indian scholars who are their *mānasaputras* proclaim the same theory. Is this interpretation correct?

Answer: This interpretation appears well reasoned superficially. But it is actually without any substance. The reason is, our great *Maharshis* were *ātmopāsakas*. They worshipped *caitanya*. They never worshipped *jaḍaprakṛti* separate from that.

आत्मैव महय्यः आत्मत्येवतु उपगच्छन्ति

Question 2: Aryans used to worship wind, light, stones, soil, trees and water. Are these not forms of inert nature?

Answer: The *Maharshis* used these forms of inert nature and also living beings like men, birds and beasts as a medium for worship of God and worshipped God alone through them.

Question 3: What is the basis for this explanation?

Answer: Their \(i.e. the *Maharshis’*\) very experience is the supreme proof. Their *śāstravākyas* also proclaim this opinion. *Paramātma* is the *ātmasvarūpi* for everything. All the *cetanas* and *acetanas* are like his body of God.

“ऐतदात्म्यमिदग्ं सर्वम्” जगत्सर्वं शरीरं ते।”

—Proclaim the *Upanishads* and *Itihāsas* indeed\!

Question 4: The world which consists of *Cetanas* and *acetanas* may be like the body of God.How can the worship of these please God?

Answer: Doesn’t the *ātman* feel happy when the sandal paste is anointed on the body? In the same way, if mother nature who is like the body of God, and infinite creatures are worshipped with *viveka* and *saṅkalpa*, God feels happy. This itself is proclaimed in the *Ahirbudhnya samhitā* thus-

> चराचराणि भूतानि सर्वाणि भगवद्वपुः।  
> अतस्तदानुकूल्यं मे कार्यमित्येव निश्चयः॥ 

\(All *bhūtakoṭis* form the body of *Bhagavān*. Therefore we have to worship them. This is indeed the conclusion.\)

Question 5: In that case only humans could be taken as the *dvāra* and be worshipped, isn’t it? Why then these viz. fire, wind, water, light, plants, and creepers were taken as *dvāras*?

Ans: There is also a system of worshipping god through humans. They have called it *manushya yajna* and have prescribed it as an obligation. And, as fire, wind, the sun, water,trees etc are the great *vibhūtis* of God, they worshipped the Lord of the universe through them also and preached the same to the world also. This is indeed another important form of worshipping *caitanya*, and not the worship of *jaḍaprkṛti*.

Question 6: Plants, trees and creepers are *acetanās*. What is special about in taking them as *dvārās* for the worship of God?

Ans: They are not *acetanās*. They also are living beings like humans, birds and animals. They too have *dharmas* like eating, natural growth, capacity to procreatre etc. Not just that. They too have feelings of pleasure and pain. They also have emotions like gratitude, anger etc. This is confirmed by some recent scientific research.

Question 7: It is a fact proven by modern research. Did the ancient *Ṛshis* who prescribed the worship of trees and *vanaspatīs* know this?

Ans: Yes, certainly they knew this. “Plants have consciousness inside They can sense happiness and pain”

अन्तस्संज्ञा भवन्त्येते सुखदुःखादि संयुताः”

—says the *manusmṛti*. We come across *vedamantras* which very clearly address the trees and plants as follows:-

“अच्छेत्ता ते मारिषम् । शतवल्शं विरोह सहस्र वल् शाः” states a *yajurvedamantra* in the beginning chapters. It is addressed to *darbha*, a *vibhūti* of the Lord in the plant form.

“O *Tuḷasi*, your origin is divine. You are very dear to *Keśava*. I am picking a few leaves of yours to offer to him. Please forgive me”.

“तुलस्यमृतजन्मासि सदा त्वं केशवप्रिये” “आराधनार्थं पुरुषोत्तमस्य लुनामि पत्रं तुलसि क्षमस्व” is the prayer of the *Āgamas* to *Tulasīmātā.*

Question 8: They could be poetic words in which the *cetanatva* has been attributed to *acetanas,* isn’t it?

Ans: Certainly no. If they were just poetical words, *Smṛtis* would not lay down rules such as *“Sanyāsis* should not pick flowers from plants and trees, and if they do so they will be gripped by *himsādosha*. Even others should collect them only for the purposes of *yajnas* and *pūjas*. A *yati* who is *jnānanishṭha* should never pick flowers and leaves from plants”. Like birds and animals, plants are also *janmaviśeshas*. But they are *tāmasayonis*. It should be noted that the *smrtis* proclaim “One who commits the worst possible sin will be born as a tree in a cemetery”. “Trees whose flowers and fruits are used for *pūjas* and *yajnas*, will get *sadgati* or will be born as a good being”. So, it is clear that trees and *vanaspatīs* are *cetanās* only and the *cetanatva* in them is not attributed by poets.

Question 9: Even then, trees and *vanaspatis* belong to a lower category among living beings. They are *sthāvaras* and *Tāmasa yonis*. Then why should they \(or God through them\) be worshipped?

Ans: *Śāstras* have not prescribed the worship of all plants, and trees. *Jnānis* have preached to treat only such trees as *dvāras* for the worship of God, which have in them an exceptional presence of divinity, which are bestowed with a special grace of their presiding deities, and those which possess an extraordinary power to remedy the three *tāpas* viz *Ādhibhautika, Ādhidaivika* and *Ādhyātmikatāpas*, and bless with *Purushārthas*. They have recommended to worship them as *Mahavibhūtis* of God. As the *bilva, Śamī* and *aparājitā vṛkshas* which are worshipped in the *Navarātra vijayadaśamī* festivals belong to this class of sacred trees, *jnānis* have prescribed their worship as a part of the worship of gods and goddesses.

Question 10: It is said above that *ŚrīJaganmātā* should be invoked in the *bilva* tree and worshipped. A twig of it is to be brought home and worshipped. What are the great qualities this tree possesses, to make it revered?

Ans: When viewed from the *ādhibhautika* aspect, *bilva vṛksha* can control the *tridoshas*. “It is *Balakara*, *rucikara*, *dīpaka, tāpanāśaka* and removes *pittajvara* and *atisāra”* says* Rājanighanṭu*. Among these even the sight of *bilva vṛksha*, its shade and the inhalation of air around it, can cure *pitta* and a few other ailments partially.

The other names of this tree such as *Śiva, Vishṇu, Vijaya, puṇya Śivapriya, Devāvāsa, tīrthapada, pāpaghna, trinayana, śuddhavarṇa, samyamī* and *śrāddha devatā* etc emphasize the divine association and sacredness of this tree.

*“Kāmadhenu* is called *Śrīh*, and *Lakshmīh*. This divine tree was born from the *gomaya* \(dung\) of *Kamadhenu* that incarnated on earth. *ŚrīDevi* was born in this tree”.

> भृगो लक्ष्मीश्च सा धेनुः गोरूपा या गता भुवम् ।  
> तद्गोमयभवो बिल्वः श्रीश्च तस्मादजायत॥ 

—Says the *Vishṇupurāṇa*.

“O *ŚrīDevi*, effulgent as the Sun, this *vanaspati* by name *bilva* which was born as a result of *tapas*, is yours”.

“आदित्यवर्णे तपसो ऽधिजातो वनस्पतिस्तव वृक्षो ऽथ बिल्वः” - says *Śrīsūkta* addressing the *Jaganmātā*. Hence this is a *ŚrīVriksha*. The following *śloka* also expresses the above said idea of *Vahnipurāṇa*.

> उत्थितो बिल्ववृक्षस्तु गोमयाम्बु निषेचनात्।  
> तत्रासौ वसते लक्ष्मीः श्रीवृक्षस्तेन चोच्यते॥ 

This tree is a confluence of all the *tīrthas*. This *ŚrīVṛksha* is an abode of not just *Śrīdevī*, but a home of the trinity, and a dwelling place of all the gods.

*ŚrīMatṛkātantra* \(*patala* 55\) says:-

“This was born on the top of the *Śrīśaila* mountain. It is the abode of *ŚrīDevī* who bestows *Śrīphala*. This is always dear to myself i.e. *Śiva* and also to *Nārāyaṇa*. It’s bottom is equal to the *Siddhapīṭha*. *Brahma*, *Vishṇu* and *Śiva* adorn it’s leaves. Its stalk is a form of *Śakti*. Any one of its triplet leaves can be used to worship *Śiva* or *Vishṇu*. That will help one to reach *Kaivalya*. *Śakti pūja* should be done especially using this”.

> श्रीशैलशिखरे जातः श्रीफलः श्रीनिकेतनः।  
> विष्णुप्रीतिकरश्चैव मम प्रीतिकरस्सदा॥ 

> ब्रह्म-विष्णु-शिवाः पत्रे वृन्तं शकिस्समाश्रिता।  
> त्रिजटापत्रकैकेन हरं वा हरिमर्चयेत्॥ 

> कैवल्यं तस्य तेनैव शकिपूजा विशेषतः।  
> बिल्ववृक्षतलं प्रोक्तं सिद्धपीठसमं सुधीः॥ 

> सर्वतीर्थमयो देवि सर्वदेवमयस्सदा।  
> श्रीवृक्षः परमेशानि अत एव न संशयः॥ 

“One who inhales the fragrance of this *ŚrīVrksha* and comes out \(after circumamblating\) will get all his *siddhis* fulfilled. He will be protected by *Sudarśana* from above and *Pāśupata* from below”, opine the *śāstras*.

> घ्‌राणं गृहीत्वा यो गच्छेत् सर्वसिद्धिमवाप्नुयात् ।  
> ऊर्ध्वं सुदर्शनं रक्षेदधः पाशुपतस्तथा॥ 

Of the triplet leaves of this tree, the top one is *Śiva*, the left one is *Brahma* and the right part is *Nārāyaṇa*,according to the *Vishṇuvacana* found in *Bṛhaddharmapurāṇa*.

> ऊर्ध्वपत्रं हरो ज्ञेयः पत्रं वामं विधिः स्वयम्।  
> अहं दक्षिणपत्रश्च त्रिपत्रदलमित्युत॥ 

The statement that the *tridaḷas* of the *bilva* are *BrahmaVishṇuŚivātmaka* is not just a eulogistic remark. ***Mahāyogeśvara Śrī Raṅga Gurudeva* in a *pūjā pravacana* at a *Sudharmāsabhā* at the *Ashṭaṅgayoga Vijnāna Mandira* in Bangalore demonstrated scientifically how each of the three leaves in the tridalatouches the corresponding *mūrti*, how they produce the particular reaction in the realm of the *nādi* of each deity, and how they make the respective deity-centres blossom.** That was a thrilling experience and it is still green in our memory. And so, we have not an iota of doubt in this regard.

Though it is very dear to all gods and goddesses, it is exceptionally dear to *Śiva*.

प्रियो हं सर्वदेवानां त्रिनेत्रस्य विशेषतः

There is a tradition to offer *bilva* mixed with *Tuḷasi* in the worship of *Nārāyaṇa* also. In *Tirupati*,Lord *Venkaṭeśvara* is offered *bilva* along with *Tulasi*. *Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavatpāda* in his work *‘Bhagavanmānasa pūja”* which is a *SriKṛshṇa mānasa pūja stuti* says “बिल्वतुलसीयुतैश्चेमं पुष्पाञ्जलिमजित ते मूर्ध्ने निदधे” extolling the combination of *Bilva* and *Tuḷasi*.

As this is the dearest *Śrīvṛksha* to *Śrīdevi, Śrīvaishṇavas* customarily store the sacred *Śrīcurṇa*, a powder which is yellow or saffron in colour used for wearing on the forehead, in a small container made from the *bilva* fruit.

Thus *Śrī Bilva Vṛksha* being an abode of the deities, helps one to have good health, removes mental agony and creates *dhāthu sāmya*, happens to be a *mahāvibhūti* of the alimighty. It is very relevent to invoke and worship *Śrīdevi* in this in *śaran navarātra mahotsava*, and to take home a branch of it and worship it. Here the worship is not for the external form, but to *Śrīdevi* who is the presiding deity, and to the Almighty. If this *tattva* is kept in mind, there will be no room for any redicule.

Question 11: We have seen earlier that people worship *Śamī Vṛksha* on *Vijayadaśamī*, and take a twig and some soil from the bottom of the tree to their houses. This practice is very significant among *kshatrīyas* who subsist on weapons. What are the great qualities of this *vṛksha* that make it exceptionally worshipful in the festival of *Vijayadaśamī*?

Answer: This also is a tree like *bilva* which is a form of the *Mahāvibhūti* of God. This tree is highly commended for *yajnas*. It is a tree which has *Agni* inside. The *samskṛit* a equivalent for the word *Banni* in Kannada, is the word *‘Vahni*‘ itself. *Maharshis* used to churn the sticks of this tree to produce sacred fire, from which they were performing *Yajnas*. For this reason this tree has come to be called *“Agnigarbha”*

अवेहि तनयां ब्रह्मन्नग्निगर्भां शमीमिव” \(शाकुन्तल\)

The divine *agni* who dwells in it is called *Durga* and the feminine form of *Agnirudra* itself is *Durgādevī*. The *Mahā Nārāyaṇa* or the *Yājnikī Upanishad* which belongs to the *Taittirīya shākhā* praises this *Durgādevī* and *Durgāgni* who make one cross *Durgas* and misfortunes.

“तामग्निवर्णां तपसा ज्वलन्तीं वैरोचनीं कर्मफलेषु जुष्टाम् ।  
दुर्गां देविग् म् शरणमहं प्रपद्ये सुतरसि तरसे नमः” 

“अग्ने त्वं पारया नव्यो अस्मान् स्वस्तिभिरति दुर्गाणि विक्ष्वा ।  
> पूश्च पृथ्वी बहुला न उर्वी भवा तोकाय तनयाय शंयोः।  
> विश्वानि नो दुर्गहा जातवेदस्सिन्धुं न नावा दुरितोतिपर्षि।  
> अग्ने अत्रिवन्मनसा गृणानोस्माकं बोध्यविता तनूनाम्॥ 

This part of *Durgāsūkta* describes how *Durgādevī*, blazing as a result of her *tapas*, is indeed *agnirūpiṇī*, and how she helps one to get over difficulties.

*Śrī Śamī Vṛksha* is a tree which is the abode of the fiery effulgence of *Durgā Devī* the *Śaktisvarūpiṇi*. It is natural the devotees worship her at the beginning of the journey of universal conquest, in which the wicked enemies are vanquished with the help of effulgent weapons that are obtained by her grace.

The *pānḍavās* had deposited all their divine weapons in a *Śamīvṛksha*. just before they entered *ajnātavāsa* \(living incognito\). This great tree, i.e. the *Śamīvṛksha* earned the gratitude of the *pānḍavas* by returning the deposit in time, ably safeguarding it by its *Āgneyadurgā Śakti*. We read in the *purāṇas* that *ŚrīRāma* also, just before launching his campaign against *Rāvaṇa* offered salutations to *Devī* who was in the form of this *Śrīvṛksha*, and, feeling pleased by her words of *abhaya*, proceeded for the journey of conquest. At the time of *Śamīpūjā* the very remembrance of those great souls who, remained loyal to *Dharma* and obtained victory, bestows upon us an exceptional *Dharmanishṭhā*, on entering our mind, and provides inspiration for the accomplishment of victory. *Agni* is known as *pāvaka* i.e. the remover of sins. Likewise, this *Agnivṛksha* also is a redeemer of sins. It ousts the evil impressions opposed to *dharma* \(dwelling in us\) and creates an enthusiasm towards *Dharma*.

The following *ślokas* of prayer recited at the time of *Śamīpūja* sums up the above purports.

> शमी शमयते पापं शमी लोहितकण्टका ।  
> धरित्र्यर्जुनबाणानां रामस्य प्रियवादिनी ॥ 

According to *Āyurveda*, it relieves one from ailments such as trembling, cough, fatigue, lepsrosy,piles and worms. All these cures are necessary for *kshatriyas* on their conquest journey. Therefore it is very approppriate for them to worship this *agnimayavṛksha* which bestows upon them all these, before they set out on the journey.

From the *ādhibhautika* point of view, it is an antidote to a number of diseases and enhances lustre \(in the body\). From the *Ādhidaivika* angle, it is the abode of gods and brings in the grace of *Durgāgnidevatā*. Looking at it from the spiritual angle, it is a tree which is an abode of *paramātmāgni* that makes one to cross the hurdles to *yoga*, and the one that helps in attaining *Samādhi* through *Upāsana*. Overall, it is highly appropriate to worship this tree on *Vijayadaśamī*.

Question 12: It has been stated earlier that a tree by name *Aparājita* can be worshipped in lieu of *Śamī* tree, if the latter is not available. Does this tree also possess such worshipful qualities?

Ans: Certainly yes. The great sages have not named just some tree as an alternative. This tree also being a *mahāvibhūti* of *Devi*, possesses the great qualities like the *Śamī* trees and is worshipful.

It is also called by other names such as *Jayantī*, *Vijayā* and *Arśaparṇī*. It should be remembered that the first two names are the name of *Jaganmātā* also. Even *Aparājitā* is an other name of *Durgādevī*. The *Devīpurāṇa* says that as *Śrī Devī* defeated the invincible demon king by name *Padma* and remained unconquerable by anyone, she is called *Vijayā* and *Aparājitā*.

> विजित्य पद्मनामानं दैत्यराजं महाबलम् ।  
> विजया तेन सा देवी लोके चैवापराजिता ॥ 

Thus, in addition to having the name of *Devī*, this *Aparājitā* tree remains an abode of exceptional presence of *Devī*, and so is suggested as a representative of *Śamī*. Some say it is just another genre of *Śamī*.

From the Ayurvedic point of view, it is a medicine for *pitta* hassles and toxins. It also helps in getting over *tridoshas*. It is an eye coolant.

When viewed from the *Ādhidaivika* angle, *Aparājitā* is \(indeed\) the abode of *Durgā Devī*. By worshipping her, one can achieve *ātmavijaya* and *lokavijaya*, says the *Skāndapurāṇa*.

> दशम्यां च नरैः सम्यक् पूजनीयोपराजिता ।  
> मोक्षार्थं विजयार्थं च पूर्वोक्तविधिना नरैः ॥ 

Thus, the worship of the trees *Bilva, Śamī* and *Aparājitā* prescribed in the *Navarātra* and *Vijayadaśamī* festivals is not at all the worship of any inert nature.

Thus, one can understand by discernment that this is indeed a variety of worship of that *Paramachaitanyarūpī Paramapurusha* who presides over *Prakṛti*, and of *Jaganmātā* who commands the inert nature.

Question 13: *Vishṇu, Śiva* and *Durgā Devī* take to sleep in *Ashāḍha*. We come across precepts which state that the *Lokamātā* should be woken up during *Navarātra mahotsava* and worshipped.. What is the significance of this? Do these divinities really sleep.? If that is the case, who looks after the huge establishment of running the world?

Ans: Actually speaking Gods and goddesses do not have even an iota of inertia of sleep. They are ever watchful, and keep overseeing the five duties such as *Śrīshṭi, Sthiti, Laya, Anugraha* and *Tirodhāna*. They always keep awake.

Question 14: If so, why do the *śāstras* mention the states of wakefulness and sleep pertaining to them?

Ans: It is just an offer of the *upacāras*. The service of sleep should be offered to them on a particular day in the *Ashāḍhamāsa* as a part of *Cāturmāsyapūjā*. It is not at all the wordly sleep. It is the *yoganidrā* that is full of \(divine knowledge\) *jnāna* and \(divine bliss\) *ānanda*. One has to have the *darśan* of the sleeping pose of the enchanting divine forms \(of those gods and godesses\). During the four months of *cāturmāsya* all of us have to reduce the quantum of wordly activities and should engage ourselves in *Dhyāna* and *pūja* at the place of our stay. And then, on the stipulated day in *Śaratkāla* we should offer the service of *suprabhātamaṅgala* and then start our routine with enthusiasm. This aspect has been dealt with in detail in the chapter of *Prathamaikādaśī*.

Question 15: When should we offer the *upacāras* of sleep and awakening to *Śrīdurgādevī*, among the prominent gods and goddess mentioned above?

Ans: The *nidropacāra* should be offered to *Śrī Durga Devī* on *Ashāḍha śukla Ashṭami* and the *suprabhātamaṅgala* should be offered in the *Śarannavarātra* festival in the *śuklapaksha* of *Āśvayujamāsa*. Sometimes, it is during the last part of the previous *Kṛshṇa Paksha*.

Question 16: What do the *śāstrās* state in this regard?

Ans: If the eighteen armed form of *ŚrīDurga* is to be worshipepd, then the *suprabhātamaṅgala sevā* should be offered on the *Bhādrapada Kṅshṇanavamī*. If the ten armed *Devi* is to be worshipped, then it should be done on *Āśvayuja Śhuklashashṭhī* \(During *Śarannavarātra*\)

> नवम्यां बोधनमष्टादशभुजायाः  
षष्ठ्यां बोधनं दशभुजायाः।  
> इति कालिका पुराणे विशेष्याभिधानम् 

Some say that the ten armed *Devī* should be offered *Suprabhātamaṅgala* on *Bhādrapada Kṛshṇanavamī* or *Āśhvayujaśukla shashṭī*.

We feel the first opinion is right. Because, the *śāstras* have clearly prescribed different days of worship corresponding to the different forms of *Devī*. The *Kāḷikapurāṇa* has seperately injoined *Bhādrapadakṛshaṇavamī* for the *Āshṭādashabhujamūrtī* and *Āśvāyujaśuklaprathamā* for the *daśabhujamūrtī*.

Question 17: At what time of the day the *pūja* of *Devī* should be done during *Navarātra* celebrations?

Ans: It should be done three times a day—in the morning, noon and at night. The *pūja* at night is given greater importance.

> प्रातःस्नायी जितद्वन्द्वः त्रिकालं शिवपूजकः  
> त्रिकालं पूजयेद्देवीं जपस्तोत्रपरायणः \(देवीपुराण\) 

“प्रातर्मध्याह्नयोः सङ्क्षेपपूजनाङ्गम्, विस्तरपूजनं तु प्रधानभूतं रात्रावेव” \(कालतत्त्वविवेक\)

Question 18: Which is more important for the *Navarātramahotsava*? The *pūjā—tithi* or *Nakshatra*?

Ans: If both the specified *tithi* and *nakshatra* coincide, it is greatly auspicious. When they do not coincide, *tithi* itself should be taken as more important. The very names of the *utsavas* i.e. *Durgāshṭamī, Mahānavamī* and *Vijayadaśamī* which are in vogue, are associated with *tithis* only. The specified *tithi* and *nakshatras* for them are as follows:

*Bilvavṛksha abhimantraṇa* should be done on *shashṭh* with *jyeshṭhā nakshatra*.

		
The *patras* should be brought home on *Saptamī* with *Mūlā nakshatra*. *Pūja*, *homa* and fasting should be done on *ashṭamī* with *Purvāshāḍha*. *Devī* should be offered *balinaivedya* on *Navamī* with *Uttarāshāḍha*. *Devī Visarjana* should be done on *daśamī* with *Śravaṇa nakshatra*.

Question 19: Precisely on which *tithi* should *Navarātri mahotsava* be begun?

Ans: It is on *Āshvayuja śuddha prathamā*. But if *prathamā tithi* has *amāvāsyā* or *dvitīyā* touching it, we have to deliberate on when it should be begun. If *prathamā* is mixed with *amāvāsyā*, and if the following day does not have *prathamā*, then *Navarātra mahotsava* should begin on *prathamā* itself. If *prathamā* happens to prevail at sunrise and extends to less than three *muhūrtas* the next day, then the celebration should begin on the *pūrna prathamā* day only. “If *amāvāsyā* continues for a period of one *muhūrta* \(on the following day of *amāvasyā*\) and *prathamā* that sets in after that happens to continue for less than three *muhūrtās* of time the next day, then, from the next day i.e.from the day of *Prathamā* which is mixed with *dvitīyā, Navarātra* festival should begin” - This is the discernment tought by some *Kālamīmāmsakas*.

The *Devipurāṇa* says “If there is *Vedha* of *Amāvāsyā* on *Prathamā*, it should be given up. And if *Prathamā* persists for even one *muhūrta* the next day \(i.e. on *dvitīyā*\), *Navarātra mahotsava* should begin on that day \(i.e.on *dvitīyā*\) only”

> अमायुक्ता न कर्तव्या प्रतिपत्पूजने मम।  
> मुहूर्तमात्रा कर्तव्या द्वितीयादि गुणान्विता॥ 

Contrary to this advice, we come across statements such as “If one begins *Navarātra* on *Prathamā* mixed with *dvitīyā* either because of the passion for *devipūjā* in *Navarātra* or by the advice of someone, then he would lose his son”

> द्वितीयाशेषसंयुक्ता प्रतिपच्चण्डिकार्चने।  
> मोहादथोपदेशाद्वा कृतं पुत्रविनाशकम् ॥ 

No doubt, these contradictory statements do create a confusion. Some say *Devī* would not agree to her begining *pūjā* on *Prathamā* with *amāvāsyā Vedha*. “If it is done on *prathamā* with *dvitīyā* touching it, one would lose his son,” say some others. Actually speaking there is no contradiction in these two statements. The purport is, householders who desire fortunes such as sons, grandsons etc. should begin *Navarātrapūjā* on the day when *prathamā* prevails for a long time, even if it has the *vedha* of *Amāvāsyā. Virkatas* i.e. those who desire *Moksha* only, should not begin the *pūjā* on *Prathamā*, which has *vedha* of *amāvāsyā*.

They should begin the *pūjā* on the second day even if *prathamā* prevails for a very short time and *dvitīyā* is for a long time. That means, those who have a desire for *dharmārthakāmas* should not begin if there is *vedha* of *dvitiyā*. Those who desire *moksha* only should avoid *amāvāsyā*. This is the purport.

If it is a pure *Prathamā tithi* without any *Vedha*, then there is no scope for *vikalpa* at all.

Question 20: What direction do the *śāstras* give about the time for the celebration of *vijayadaśamī*?

The *daśamī* of *Āshvayuja śukla* is called *Vijayadaśamī* or *Vijayādaśamī*. *Vijayadaśamī* should be celebrated on that day.

Question 21: Should the *daśamī* at sunrise be considered for this or at sunset?

And: If it is *śuklapaksha*, the *daśamī* at sunrise is to be considered. If it is *kṛshṇapaksha* it is *daśamī* at sunset.

> शुक्लपक्षे तिथिर्ग्राह्या यस्यामभ्युदितो रविः।  
> कृष्णपक्षे तिथिर्ग्राह्या यस्यामस्तमितो रविः॥ 

According to this rule, as it is *śuklapaksha*, the *tithi* at sunrise also should be considered for *Vijayadaśamī*, some say. But as the situation here unlike the other *māsas* and *pakshas*, is one which relates to *Vijayadaśamī*, it is not possible to arrive at a conclusion by merely aplying the above said rule.

Like the *daśamī tithi, Śravaṇnakshatra* is also excellent for *devatāpūjā* on that day. If both happen to occur, it is best and there can be no doubt about it. Here, like *Janmāshṭamī, tithi* is more important than *nakshatra*, but still *nakshatra* is also considered at times.

A *Śāstramīmāmsaka* by name *Hemādri* says—*“Vijayadaśamī* should be observed on the day of *Śravaṇa nakshatra*, if there is any *Vedha* on the day of *daśamī*; otherwise, it should be observed on the day of *navamī tithi”*.

		
Some more opinions are as follows:

1. If *daśamī* is touched by both *navamī* and *Ekādaśī*, and, if there is no *Śravaṇa nakshatra* on the next day, then *Vijayadaśamī* should be observed on the day of *Navamī tithi* only. 
2. *Aparājitā Devī* should be worshipped only on the day when *daśamī* is touched by *navamī* in the afternoon. 
3. *Aparājitā devī* should never be worshipped on *Ekādaśī*. 
4. Afternoon is the most auspicious time for *Devī pūjā*. *Pradoshakāla* is the secondary option. If *daśamī* prevails in the afternoon on both the days, then the previous day itself \(with *navamī*\) should be considered for *Vijayadaśamī pūja*. If *daśamī* prevails during the time of *pradosha* both the days \(but not in the afternoon\), then the second day, \(i.e. the day of *Ekādaśī*\) should be considered for *Vijayadaśamī pūjā*. If *daśamī* does not prevail in the afternoon on both the days, then the first day \(i.e. the day with *navamī*\) should be considered for *Vijayadaśamī*. But if *Śravaṇa nakshatra* prevails in the afternoon of the next day, then that day \(i.e. *daśamī* with *Ekādaśī*\) should be considered for *vijayadaśamī pūjā*. 
5. If on a day *daśamī* prevails at least for a short time at sunrise, and the rest of the day is *Ekādaśī*, and *Śravaṇa nakshatra* prevails in the afternoon, then that day should be called *‘Vijayā’*. Since *ŚrīRāma* launched his journey of conquest against *Rāvaṇa* on the day of *Śravaṇa nakshatra*, *Vijayadaśamī* should be celebrated on the day of that *nakshatra* only. 
6. The time of the rising of stars just after dusk on *Aśvayuja śukladaśamī* is called *‘vijaya’*. Endeavours begun at that time shall become fruitful. 
7. If fifteen *muhūrtas* happen to occur on any day, then the eleventh *muhūrta* is called *‘vijaya’*. 

When such a *muhūrta* occurs on a day, such an auspicious *daśamī* is called *Vijayadaśamī*.

If pure *daśamī tithi* occurs without the touch of any other *tithi*, then *Vijayadaśamī* should be observed on that day without any *vikalpa*. If *Śravaṇa nakshatra* also occurs on that day, it is more auspicious. If the day happens to be a pure *daśamī ‘tithi*, then even in the absence of *Śravaṇa nakshatra*, *Vijaya daśamī* should be observed on that day.

When pure *daśami tithi* is not available then *dasāmi tithi* joined with *navamī* is prefrable to *Ekādaśī*. But if that *Ekādaśī* has the *Śravaṇa nakshatra yoga*, we think it is auspicious for *viajayadaśamī pūjā*, even if happens to be an *Ekādaśī*.

**Here, we would like to humbly interpret this matter on the strength of the impressions provided by *Śrīgurūpadesa* as follows:** “For those who desire *Dharma, Artha* and *Kama*, *daśamī* touched with *Navamī* is best, if pure *daśamī* is not available. For those who desire *Moksha*, *daśamī* touched with *Ekādaśī* is best, and for those who desire all the *Purushārthās, Ekādaśī* with *Śrāvaṇa* is best”.

The abovesaid *Kālamīmāmsa* may sound unnecessary to the lay man. But when some doubts arise in that regard, it becomes very necessary to provide a satisfactory and critical clarification to the *jijnāsus*. Therefore, we have discussed the matter briefly here.





	 
## Prathamaikādaśī

*Prathamaikādaśī * is one of the most important festivals observed in our country. The *Ekādaśī* which falls in the *śuklapaksha* of the month of *Āshāḍha* is called by this name. This festival is also called by names such as *Ekādaśī*, festival of fasting, *mahaikādasī*, *sāyanī* etc. This happens to be a very important *parva* observed by virtuous people of all the *varṇas* and *Āśramas*, and people belonging to all sects such as *Śaiva*, *Vaishṇava* etc.

### Nāmanirvacana
**1\) *Nāmanirvacana*** \(explanation of the name\): This is called *Ekādaśī* as this is a *vrata* related to the *Ekādaśi tithi. Ekādaśī* comes twice every month. But this *Ekādaśī* is the most important of all *Ekādaśīs*, and so is called by that name. There is a rule that those who cannot afford to observe the other *Ekādaśīs* in the prescribed manner, should observe at least this *Ekādaśī.* Thus, this is specially called *Ekādaśī*. For example, all the *caturdaśis* of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* of every month are *Śivarātris* only. But only the *caturdaśi* of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* of the *Māghamāsa* is called *Śivarātri.* Just as *Śivarātri* is so called because of the special importance it carries on that day, the above said *Ekādaśī* of the *śuklapaksha* of *Āshāḍha* is called *Ekādaśī*.

*Prathamaikādaśī* means the first *Ekādaśī*. When the *Ekādaśīs* of the *śuklapaksha* of all the months are *Prathamaikādaśī*s, how come only this is called *Prathamaikādaśī*? It is because,

1. There is a custom among some Hindus to begin the year with *varshaṛtu* \(rainy season\). \(The synonym *varsha* for *samvatsara* indicates this.\) As per that reckoning, this *Ekādaśī* occurs at the beginning of the year, and so the name *Prathamaikādaśī*. 
2. As this *Ekādaśī* immediately precedes the beginning of *‘cāturmāsya’* which happens to be an important *vrata*, this is referred to as *Prathamaikādaśī*. 
3. The word *‘prathama’* is also used to mean ‘the very best’, \(scholars have noted that the word *‘prathama’*, used by *Kālidāsa* in his *meghasandeśa* also means ‘the best’, in the verse *‘Āshāḍhasya prathama divase.’* If the meaning for the word *Prathama* here is taken in the sense of *‘First’*, the *Utthānadvādaśi* referred to in stanza 47 falls short by 20 days\). Also, as this happens to be the most auspicious among the *Ekādaśīs*, this is duly called *Prathamaikādaśī*. The other name *Mahaikādasi* also signifies the greatness of this *vrata*. Though this comes in the *dakshiṇayāna,* it is called *sāyanī* also because it bestows the path of *Devayāna* called *uttarāyaṇa*. 

As this this is a great festival during which the rules of fasting have to be \(specially\) observed, it is referred to as ‘a festival of fasting’. In this sense, even the *MahāŚivarātri* is a festival of fasting only.

### Statements of scriptures which prescribe fasting:

We come across hundreds of statements in *smṛtis*, *purāṇas*, history, and *parva mīmāmsā* literature, which ordain fasting on this day. Some of them may be noted here.

1\). The *purāṇas* proclaim time and again—“On the day of *Harivāsara* \(i.e. *Ekādaśī*\), all the sins take refuge in food. So, a person taking food on that day, becomes a party for those sins. So, never take food on a *Harivāsara”*

> यानि कानि च पापानि ब्रह्महत्यासमानि च ।  
> अन्नमाश्रित्य तिष्ठन्ति सम्प्राप्ते हरिवासरे ॥ \(नारदीयपुराण, 24-4\) 

> तानि पापान्यवाफ्नोति भुनो हरिवासरे ।  
> रटन्तीह पुराणानि भूयो भूयो वरानने ॥  
> न भोक्तव्यं न भोक्तव्यं सम्प्राप्ते हरिवासरे \(मत्स्यपुराण 23-24\) 

> सत्यं सर्वाणि पापानि ब्रह्महत्यादिकानि च ।   
> सन्त्येवौदनमाश्रित्य श्रीकृष्णव्रतवासरे ॥ \(ब्रह्मवैवर्त—कृष्णजन्मखण्ड\) 

*Nāradīya* states that this fasting is an obligatory scriptural rule that has to be observed.

> नित्यं भक्तिसमायुक्तैः सर्वैर्विष्णुपरायणैः ।   
> पक्षे पक्षे तु कर्तव्यमेकादश्यामुपोषणम् ॥ \(नारदीयपुराण 10-238\) 

Sage *Kātyāyana* is of the opinion that this is a *kāmya vrata*.

> संसारसागरोत्तारमिच्छन्विष्णुपरायणः   
> ऐश्वरं सन्ततिं स्वर्गं मुक्तिं वा यद्यदिच्छति   
> एकादश्यां न भुन्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि ॥ \(कात्यायन 10-239\) 

Sage *Devala* is of the opinion that, the rule that one should not take food on both the *Ekādaśīs* of a month applies to only *yatis* and *Vānaprasthas,* and *gṛhasthas* should observe only the *Ekādaśī* of the *śuklapaksha*—.

> एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि ।   
> वनस्थयतिधर्मोऽयं शुक्लामेव सदा गृही ॥ \(देवलस्मृति\) 

But this rule is applicable only to *non—Vaishṇavas*.

> शुक्लामेव तु कुर्वन्ति गृहिणो वैष्णवेतराः ।   
> न कृष्णालङ्घने दोषस्तेषां वेदेषु नारद ॥ \(ब्रह्मवैवर्तपुराण 4-26-38\) 

There are also statements which ordain that *gṛhasthas* should fast only on *Kṛshṇa Ekādaśīs* that fall between *Āshadhaśuklaikādaśī* and *Kārtikaśuddhaikādaśi* which are respectively called *śayanī* and *bodhinī,* and that they should not observe fast on the remaining *Kṛshṇa Ekādaśīs*.

> शयनी बोधिनीमध्ये या कृष्णैकादशी भवेत् ।   
> सैवोपोष्या गृहस्थेन नान्या कृष्णा कदाचन ॥ \( ब्रह्मवैवर्त 4-26-39\) 

We also come across statements which tell that a householder blessed by male progeny, should not fast on the days of *Saṅkrānti*, *Ekādaśīs* of *Kṛshṇapaksha* and eclipses.

> सङ्क्रान्त्यामुपवासं च कृष्णैकादशिवासरे   
> चन्द्रसूर्यग्रहे चैव न कुर्यात्पुत्रवान् गृही ॥ \(नारद and ब्रह्मपुराण\) 

The *Bhavishyottara Purāṇa* says that the rule which prescribes fasting on both the *Ekādaśīs* of the two *pakshas*, applies only to *brahmacāris*, *sanyāsis* and widows. And *Gṛhasthas* should observe fast only on the *Śukla Ekādaśi.*

> एकादश्यां न भुञ्चीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि\)   
> ब्रह्मचारी च नारी च शुक्लामेव सदा गृही॥ 

But the authors *Hemādri* and *Halāyudha*, in their work *parvamīmamsa* state that *Vaishṇavas* of all *Āśramas* should fast on *Ekādaśīs* of both the fortnights.

> वस्तुतस्तु वैष्णवानां सपुत्राणां गृहस्थानामपि   
सर्वाः कृष्णाः नित्याः” तद्यथा 

> यथा शुक्ला तथा कृष्णा यथा कृषा तथेतरा ।   
> तुल्ये ते मन्यते यस्तु स वै वैष्णव उच्यते ॥ 

#### Importance of fasting
Greatness \(glory\) of fasting on *Ekādaśī:*

The significance of fasting on *Ekādaśī* has been greatly described by the *śāstras*. A few of them may be noted here.

The *Padmapurāṇa* says —

As a result of fasting on *Ekādaśī*, the firewood of sins accumulated over hundreds of births gets burnt to ashes. Even the benefit accrued by performing *mahāyāgas* does not amount to even the one sixteenth part of the religious merit gained by fasting on *Ekādaśī*. Even great pilgrimage centers cannot equal this. This bestows great worldly benefits such as heaven, *moksha*, kingdom, virtuous children, good wife, good health etc.

> अश्वमेधसहस्राणि राजसूयशतानि च ।   
> एकादश्युपवासस्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम् ॥ 

> स्वर्गमोक्षप्रदा ह्येषा शरीरारोग्यदायिनी ।   
> सुकलत्रप्रदा ह्येषा जीवत्पुत्रप्रदायिनी ॥ 

> न गङ्गा न गया भूप न काशी न च पुष्करम् ।   
> न चापि वैष्णवं क्षेत्रं तुल्यं हरिदिनेन च ॥ 

> यमुना चन्द्रभागा न तुल्या हरिदिनेन तु।   
> अनायासेन येनात्र प्राप्यते वैष्णवं पदम् ॥   
\(पद्मपुराण, आदिखण्ड 31, 157, 160-162\) 

The moment the word *Ekādaśī* falls on their ears, even *yamadūtas* become hesitant.

“श्रुत्वा चैकादशी नाम यमदूताश्च शङ्किताः \(*Padmapurāṇa*, *Brahmakhanda*\). “A certain woman, who was a worst sinner, happened to fast in *Ekādaśī* due to some anger and died. Even she became purified.”

		
> निराहार कृताद्वै च निर्मला सा बभूव ह \(पद्मपुराण ब्रह्मखण्ड\) 

If the *puṇya* accrued from *pṛthvīdāna* \(gifting of the whole earth\) is placed on one pan of a balance, and the *phala* \(benefit\) accrued from fasting on *Ekādaśī* on the other, the latter happens to be more meritorious.

> एकतः पृथिवीदानं एकत्र हरिवासरः ।   
> ततोप्येका महापुण्या इयमेकादशी वरा ॥ \(गरुडपुराण\) 

### On Prathamaikādaśī
*Prathamaikādaśī* is also well—known by the name *śayanaikādaśi* in the *śāstras*. In some texts we come across words such as ‘शयनी बोधिनी मध्ये या कृष्णैकादशी भवेत् सायनैकादशी” It is indeed hard to reason how the word *śayana* has come to get associated with *Ekādaśī* here. It is possible that, the word *śāyana*, either by mispronunciation or due to a printing error, has become *‘sāyana’*.

1\) Why then, this is called by the name *śayanaikādaśi*? *Śayana* means going to bed or sleeping. It is not the *Sādhakas* who are supposed to sleep on this day. *Jnānis* say that *Sādhakas* should keep themselves awake during the whole day and also during the night \(if possible\), and meditate upon God and praise his glory.

एकादश्यामहोरात्रं कर्तव्यं भो जन त्रयम् ।   
> अहोरात्रोपवासश्च जागरो हरिपूजनम् ॥ 

In that case which sleep is intended by the word *śayana* here? The scriptures say that it refers to the sleep of the great Lord, *MahāVishṇu,* who is specially worshipped in this *parva*. He sleeps on the day of *Āshadhaśukladvādaśi* and wakes up on *Kartikaśukla dvādaśi*. In the meantime he may also turn over on his side, in the month of *bhādrapadamāsa*.

“शेते विष्णुस्सदोषाढे भाद्रे च परिवर्तते ।   
> कार्तिके च प्रबुद्ध्येत शुक्लपक्षे हरेर्दिने ॥ ” 

“स्वापस्तु विष्णोर्मिथुने शुक्लद्वादशिका तिथौ ।   
> पवित्रं विदधीतैव मिथुनस्थे दिवाकरे॥” 

“दुग्धाब्धौ शेषपर्यङ्क,ए आषाढ्यां संविशेद्धरिः ।   
> निद्रां त्यजति कार्तिक्यां तयोस्सम्पूजयेद्धरिम् ॥” 

“विष्णुः स्वपिति कर्कटे ”  
“आषाढशुक्लद्वादश्यां शयनं कुरुते हरिः” 

Thus, in the background of Lord *Vishṇu* assuming *nidrāmudrā* on *Āshaḍhaśukladvādaśī*, the term *‘śayanaikādaśi’* matches clearly, as this *parva* occurs on the preceeding day.

\(ii\) When should we celebrate *Prathamaikādaśī*? It is very clear that it should be celebrated on *Āshaḍaśukla Ekādaśī.*. If *Ekādaśī tithi* happens to overlap with the *Dvādasi tithi* of the next day, or *Daśami tithi* of the preceding day, when should it be observed? In this regard, we come across contradicting opinions.

*Śāstras* state that \(in some distint contexts\), fasting can be observed on the day of *Ekādaśī,* though touched by *Daśami*.

“एकादशी न लभ्येत सकला द्वादशी यदि ।   
> उपोष्या दशमी विद्धा ऋषिरुद्दालकोऽब्रवीत्” ॥ 

> “त्रयोदश्यां न लभ्येत द्वादशी यदि किञ्चन ।   
> उपोष्यैकादशी तत्र दशमी मिश्रितापि च” ॥ 

Also there are abundant scriptural statements that state that there should be no *vedha* of *daśamī tithi* on *Ekādaśī vratopavāsa*. And even if there happens to be a little *vedha*, that day should be given up, and fasting should be observed only on *Dvādaśi*.

> “कलार्धेनापि विद्धा स्याद्दशम्यैकादशी यदा ।   
> तदा ह्येकादशीं त्यक्त्वा द्वादशीं समुपोषयेत् ॥” 

“नोपोष्या दशमीविद्धा सदैवैक्कादशी तिथिः ।”   
“द्वादशीमिश्रिता कार्या सर्वत्रैकादशी तिथिः ।”   
“सर्वप्रकारवेधोऽयं उपवासस्य दूषकः ।” 

“न दशम्या युतां क्वचित्”   
“उपोष्या द्वादशी तत्र य इच्छेत्परमां गतिम्” 

And it does not help even if an option is provided by stating that fasting connected with *Ekādaśī* can be done, in either cases of *Ekādaśī* having *vedha* with *Daśami* or *Dvādaśī*, for, there are many statements, which condemn fasting on *Ekādaśī* as very mean, if it has *vedha* with *Daśami*.

“तामुपोष्य नरो जह्यात्पुण्यं वर्षशतोद्भवं”   
“तस्यापत्यविनाशय परेत्य नरकं व्रजेत्”   
“तदा त्याज्या विशेषेण गङ्गाम्भः श्वदृतौ यथा” 

“If fasting is done on *Ekādaśī* having *vedha* with *Daśamī*, it causes loss of *puṇya*, harm to children, and pushes one to hell. Because *Gāndhāri* observed fasting on such a day, she lost all her hundred sons. The benefits of fasting on such a day go to *mohinī* \(an evil spirit in the form of a beautiful woman\)”

“दशमीशेषसंयुक्ता गान्धार्या समुपोषिता ।   
> तस्या पुत्रशतं नष्टं तस्मात्तां परिवर्जयेत् ॥” 

“ऊचुस्ते मोहिनीं देवा लोकसंमोहनाय च ।   
> दत्तं मोहिनि ते स्थानं प्रत्यूषे दशमीयुतम् ॥” 

Only *Vaishṇavas* are barred from observing a fast when *Daśamī vedha* is there at the time of *Aruṇodaya*.

“दशमीशेषसंयुक्तो यदि स्यादरुणोदयः ।   
> नैवोपोष्यं वैष्णवेन तस्मिन्नैकादशीव्रतम् ॥” 

Non—*Vaishṇavas* should observe *Ekādaśī* even if there is vedha of *daśamī.*

*Dayāndasarasvati* ridicules the idea of stipulating different *Ekādaśī* days for *Smārtas* and *Vaishṇavas*. “The division of *Smārtas*, *Vaishṇavas* and *ŚrīVaishṇavas* is of recent origin. How can this figure in the opinion of sages who wrote *śāstras*? he says. Also, we come across many a handiwork, such as creating new stories to condemn the opinion of others and to defend one’s own, composing new sentences and inserting them in the text of the *śāstras* written in old palm leaves etc. And so, it becomes difficult to identify interpolations and the genuine text parts as well.

As per the prevalent practice, *Ekādaśī* is observed by those who are calld *Smārtas,* on the day when the *Ekādaśī tithi* has more pervasion, inspite of the *vedha* of *Daśami*. *Vaishṇavas* and *ŚrīVaishṇavas* do not observe *Ekādaśī vrata* on the day when it has the *vedha* of *Daśami*. One may try to provide a solution by saying that it is proper if people of different categories follow their respective traditions. Even some *Ācāryas* who have proclaimed that fasting on *Ekādaśī* should be observed on the day which is free from *vedha* have said “Let them observe fasting at least on the day with *vedha*. It will anyhow please Lord *Śrīhari”*. \(*haridina tilakam* of *Ācārya venkatanātha*\).

“But, why is that contradicting opinions in the ancient *śāstras* are seen regarding the observance of *Ekādaśī* which is distinguished \(by the division such as\) the one with *vedha* of *Daśami* and the other without? What has the present classification viz *smārtas, Vaishṇavas* and *ŚrīVaishṇavas* got to do with the above said śāstraic words? This question remains to be solved. Even the *‘Kāzinyāya* \(A kannada word which means “a verdict which is meant to satisfy both the parties in a dispute.” *Śāstraic* words?\) cannot be applied here. Then which of the two traditions is right? **We placed this question before *ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* who was endowed with the capacity of measuring the effect of the observance of that *vrata* on the human body and soul with the help of the relevant scientific knowledge, and who was able to comprehend the benefits obtained by observing the *vrata* on both the days, and also what one may lose by abstaining from that observance, and also the different kinds of beneficial effects. He could comprehend these with practical knowledge, and not by mere bookish knowledge.**

**“Both the traditions are correct” came the answer. “How could both be correct?” “Is it not ridiculous to have different arrangements for *Smārtas, Vaishṇavas, ŚrīVaishṇavas* Etc?” was our next question. He commanded—“I did not mean that kind of an arrangement. There are two types of people who observe fast; The ones who belong to the first type desire only *moksha*. The people of the second type desire in addition of *moksha*, the other accomplishments of life viz. *Dharma, Artha* and *Kāma*. The *tithi* without *Daśami vedha* is suitable for the people of the first type, and the *tithi* with *Daśami vedha* is suitable for the second type.”**

> विद्धा समैकादश्यौ गृहियत्योर्व्यवस्थिते”   
“शुद्धैव द्वादशी राजन्नुपोष्या मोक्षकाङ्क्षिभिः ।   
> सकामैर्गृहिभिः पूर्वविद्धापीति विनिश्चयः ॥ 

Much later, we happened to come across scriptural statements which also express the same opinion.

On the whole, it can be stated that both the days, i.e the one with *Daśami Vedha* and the one without, are appropriate for the observance of *Ekādaśī*. We wish to put forth the conclusion that the assigning of \(*Ekādaśī*\) depends on the objective with which one observes this *parva*.

### Who are authorized to observe *Ekādaśī?*

Some say that *Ekādaśī* is a *Vaiśnavite vrata* and so only *Vaishṇavas* should observe it. Those belonging to *śaiva, soura* and other sects need not observe it. This is not correct. Even though it is called *‘haridina’* owing to the importance of *Vishṇu* in the *vrata*, people belonging to all sects can profit by this, as it possesses a *Kāladharma* which is helpful for the meditation on the *parañjyoti*. *Śāstras* state that though *Śivarātri* is mainly a *vrata* for the worship of *Śiva*, it is proper for *Vaishṇavas* also to observe it.

> शैवो वा वैष्णवो वापि यो वा स्यादन्यपूजकः   
> सर्वं पूजाफलं हन्ति शिवरात्रबहिर्मुखः ॥ \(दशनिर्णयी, पु. 144\) 

*Śāstras* proclaim the same purport regarding *Ekādaśī* also.

> वैष्णवो वाथ शैवो वा कुर्यादेकादशीव्रतम्”   
> वैष्णवो वाथ शैवो वा सौरोप्येतत्समाचरेत्” \(सौरपुराण\) 

Is *Ekādaśi nitya* or *kāmya*? *Śāstras* state that big blemishes may be caused, if it is not observed.

> एकादश्यन्नकामस्य निष्कृतिः क्वापि नोदिता   
> न भोक्तव्यं न भोक्तव्यं सम्प्राप्ते हरिवासरे \(नारद\) 

Therefore it is a *nityavrata*. Also, *Śāstras* say that a person who desires material comforts, progeny, wealth, *mukti* and all such things, can observe this *vrata*, and so, it is a *kāmya vrata* too.

> य इच्छेद्विष्णुसायुज्यं सुतान्सम्पदमात्मनः ।   
> एकादश्यां न भुञ्चीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि \(विष्णुपुराण\) 

> य इच्छेद्विष्णुसायुज्यं श्रियं सन्ततिमात्मनः ।   
> एकादश्यामुपवसेत्पक्षयोरुभयोरपि \(कूर्मपुराण\) 

#### 1. Exceptions to fasting:

We have noted the *śāstravākyas* which state that fasting is mandatory on the day of *Ekādaśī,* and it amounts to a great sin if fasting is not done on that day. But there are some *śāstravākyas* which state that some need not fast and some should not.

Some words of authority say that the rule that one must fast on both the *Ekādaśīs* applies to non—*gṛhasthas* and *gṛhasthas* should fast only on the *Ekādaśīs* of *śuklapaksha*. For Example—

> एकादश्यां न भुञ्चीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि ।   
> वनस्थयतिधर्मोऽयं शुक्लामेव सदा गृही॥ 

“\(The rule of fasting on *Ekādaśis* of both the *pakshas* applies to *vānaprasthas* and *yatis* only. *Gṛhasthas* should observe fast only on the *Ekādaśi* of *śuklapaksha*\)”—says the *Devalasmṛti*.

*Padmapurāṇa* and *Brahmavaivarta purāṇas* say that *gṛhasthas* should observe fast only on the *Ekādaśīs* of the *Kṛshṇapakshas*, which come between *śayanī* and *Bodhinī Ekādaśis*. On other *Ekādaśīs* of *Kṛshṇapaksha* they should not observe fast.

शयनीबोधिनीमध्ये या कृष्णैकादशी भवेत् ।   
> सैवोपोष्या गृहस्थेन नान्या कृष्णा कदाचन ॥ 

*Bhavishyottara purāṇa* says that *brahmacāris* and widows should observe fast on all *Ekādaśīs* of both the *pakshas*, whereas *gṛhasthas* should fast only on *śukla Ekādaśīs*.

		
> एकादश्यां न भुञ्चीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि ।   
> ब्रह्मचारी च नारी च शुक्लामेव सदा गृही ॥ 

*Sumaṅgalis* should observe fast only on *śukla Ekādaśīs* like the *gṛhasthas”*.

“एवं च सधवाया गृहस्थवत् शुक्लायामेवाधिकारः” ॥ \(समय प्रकाश\) 

“A *gṛhastha* having sons should not observe fast on *saṅkrānti*, *kṛshnaikādaśi* and on the days of solar and lunar eclipses.”

> सङ्क्रान्त्यामुपवासं च कृष्णैकादशीवासरे ।   
> चन्द्रसूर्यग्रहे चैव न कुर्यात्पुत्रवान् गृही ॥ 

Says the *Nāradīya vacana*.

“All these statements refer to non—*Vaishṇavas*. *Vaishṇavas* must observe fast on both *śukla* and *Kṛshṇa Ekādaśīs.”*

> शुक्लामेव तु कुर्वन्ति गृहिणो वैष्णवेतराः ।   
> न कृष्णालङ्घने दोषस्तेषां वेदेषु नारद ॥ 

> यथा शुक्ला तथा कृष्णा यथा कृष्णा तथेतरा ।   
> तुल्ये ते मन्यते यस्तु स वै वैष्णव उच्यते ॥ \(तत्त्वसागर\) 

*Śāstras* opine that those who are below the age of eight years, and those above the age of eighty years need not observe fast.

> अष्टवर्षाधिको मर्त्यो ह्यशीतिन्यूनवत्सरः ।   
> एकादश्यामुपवसेत् पक्षयोरुभयोरपि ॥ \(कात्यायनीय\) 

####  2. Concessions to those who are unable to observe total fast:

*Śāstras* relax rules in the case of weak persons who cannot observe total fast, and state an *Anukalpa* \(alternative\)

“Rice should not be consumed at all on *Ekādaśīs*. But roots, common sweet potato, fruits, milk and water may be taken.”

> मूलं फलं पयस्तोयं उपभोज्यं मुनीश्वरैः ।   
> न त्वत्र भोजनं कैश्चिदेकादश्यां प्रदर्शितम् ॥ \(नारद पुराण\) 

Those who cannot fast for the whole day may at least abstain from taking food at night. They may take *havishyānna* \(rice cooked in milk\) or other food items that are not prepared from rice. Fruits, sesame , milk, water, ghee or *pañcagavya* may be taken. The latter items are more excellent than the earlier ones.

> नक्तं हविष्यान्नमनौदनं वा ।   
> फलं तिलाः क्षीरमथाम्बु चाज्यम्॥ 

> यत्पञ्चगव्यं यदि वा च वायुः ।   
> प्रशस्तमत्रोत्तरमुत्तरं च ॥ 

The *vāyu* and the *varāha purāṇas* are of the opinion that any one of the food items mentioned above may be taken, depending upon the physical strength of a person.

“Those who are unable to fast and those who are above eighty years of age may observe alternatives such as *Ekābhukta* \(*Ekābhukta* means eating only once in a day\)”

> उपवासे त्वशक्तानां आशीतेरूर्ध्वजीविनाम् ।   
> एकभुक्तादिकं कार्यमाह बौधायनो मुनिः ॥ 

This opinion of *Baudhāyana* is quoted by *Hemādri. Matsya purāṇa* also expresses the same opinion. Such weak persons may observe fast at noon, and eat only at night. “If they are ill, their son, disciple, etc may observe fast on their behalf and gift \(pass on\) the merit of fasting to them.” We come across such statements in the following *ślokas*.

> उपवासेष्वशक्तानां नक्तं भोजनमिष्यते ।   
> असामर्थ्ये शरीरस्य पुत्रादीन्कारयेद्व्रतम् ॥ 

*Ekābhukta* means eating only once \(i.e. in the evening between the 13th and 18th *ghatīs* i.e. \(between 5.12 PM and 7.12 PM\). *‘Naktam’* means, eating at night. \(i.e. after sighting the stars at night\) *‘ayācita’* means taking the food one gets without requesting for it. Those who cannot fast completely may do one of the above.

These are secondary. But the words of *Manu* should be remembered here which state—“It won’t be *śāstra* approved, if one resorts to these, even though he is able to take up the first option. The one who does so is a fool. In the *Paraloka* he can not get the spiritual benefits of the observance of *vratas*.

> प्रभुः प्रथमकल्पस्य योऽनुकल्पेन वर्तते ।   
> न साम्परायिकं तस्य दुर्मतेर्विद्यते फलम्ं ॥ 

Whatever may be the option resorted to, adherence to *Brahmacarya, Sadācāra, Ātmaguṇas,* and worship of God etc., should be strictly observed.

####  3. The procedure of observing the *vrata*

Those who observe the *Ekādaśī vrata*, should with a solomen vow, pray Lord *Nārāyaṇa* to bestow his blessings for the flawless observance of *vratas* on all the three days viz., *Daśami, Ekādaśī* and *Dvādaśī*. They should eat only once even on *Daśami* and should observe *Brahmacarya*. They should not eat on a bronze plate, should not sleep during day time, and should not over eat or over drink. Eating meat is prohibited. Chewing betel leaves, gambling, consuming liquor and uttering falsehood etc. should be shunned. They should sleep on a bed, spread on the floor.

In the morning of *Ekādaśī*, teeth should be brushed with leaves. After bath and morning rituals, wearing a *darbha pavitra* \(a ring made of *darbha* grass\) and holding a copper vessel filled with water and sitting north faced, a prayer should be made to god with the solemn vow—“Lord *Acyuta*\! Today I am observing a fast and shall do *pāraṇa* tomorrow. Kindly bless me in this.” Or, a handful of flowers should be offered to Lord *Śrīhari* along with prayers. Those who cannot observe a total fast, should in their vow, utter the option they wish to follow. *Śaivas* should vow with *Rudragāyatri. Sūryopāsakas* should vow with the famous *Sāvitrī mantra*. The vow should be made along with the *Ashṭākshari Mahāmantra* pronounced three times. In the beautifully decorated *manṭapa*, *pūja* should be offered to *Śrī Hari* with all the *upacāras*. The Lord should be hailed with words of victory. To the utmost of one’s capacity, *Jāgaraṇa* should be observed in the night and the time has to be spent in praising and singing the glory of God.

एकादश्यां नरो यस्तु कुरुते जागरं नरः ।   
> गीतैर्नृत्यैस्तथा वाद्यैः प्रेक्षणीयैः पृथग्विधैः ॥ 

> स याति वैष्णवं लोकं यं गत्वा न निवर्तते ।   
> सम्पूज्य विधिवद्रात्रौ कृत्वा चैव प्रजागरम् ॥ 

> कथा वा गीतिका विष्णोः गायन् विष्णुपरायणः ।   
> याति विष्णोः परं स्थानं नरो नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥ 

Thus, done with a vow, the observation comes to be called *‘Ekādaśī Vrata’* \(*Ekādaśī vrata* can also be done without the *saṅkalpa* by following the remaining rules.\) There is will be no *homa* in this *vrata*.

The next morning, after the worship of God and feeding the Brāhmins, the *vrata* should be completed. This completion of observance is also called *‘pāraṇa’*. It is so called because, the *vrata* can see the *pāra* \(the other end\) only by that \(पार तीर कर्म समाप्तौ\).

The completion will be only on *Dvādaśi*. And till this *vrata* is completed no other *vrata* should be taken up.

> पारणान्तं व्रतं ज्ञेयं व्रतान्ते विप्रभोजनम् ।   
> असमाप्ते व्रते पूर्वं नैव कुर्याद्व्रतान्तरम् ॥ 

Full benefit of the *vrata* will be obtained only with the worship of Brahmins and their blessings.

The *kūrmapurāṇa* says that *Pāraṇa* should be observed only on *dvādaśi* and not on *Trayodaśi*. But if no trace of *dvādaśi* is there on the day next to the day of fasting, then *pāraṇa* will have to be done on *Trayodaśi* itself. Even the *Mādhyahnika* should be done in the morning itself on the day of *Dvādaśī*, and *Pāraṇa* lunch should be had. It is *Ekabhukta* only even on *Dvādaśi* and dinner should not be had. Sleeping during day time etc is prohibited.

The three some viz. *Daśami, Ekādaśī* and *Dvādasi*, is called *‘haridina’*. Even those who cannot observe *Ekādaśī*, should worship god during the dawn of *dvādaśī*, and should do *pāraṇa* in the morning. It is because, just like *Ekādaśī, Dvādaśī* also is independently an excellent day to propitiate God and a *vratadina*. If it is not possible to do *pāraṇa* on time, at least *jalapāraṇa* \(i.e. drinking of water\) should be done. Thus, drinking of water in the prescribed manner will bestow the benefits of both *Bhojana* and *Upavāsa.*

“यदपोऽअनति तन्नैवाशितं नैवानशितम् ”

### *Pūja* and *Jāgaraṇa*

The three *puṇyakāryas* \(meritorious deeds\) that have to be mainly performed on the day of *Ekādaśī* as per the śāstraic customs are—

1. day and night fasting 
2. *Jāgaraṇa* and 
3. worship of *Nārāyaṇa*. 

> एकादश्यामहोरात्रं कर्तव्यं भो जन त्रयम् ।   
> दिवारात्रोपवासश्च जागरो विष्णुपूजनम् ॥ 

The last one of the above i.e. the worship of god \(both internal and external\) should be specially done. Every person should do this to the best of his capacity. Among the three *tithis* viz., *Daśami*, *Ekādaśī* and *Dvādaśi* known as *Haridinas*, the middle one i.e. *Ekādaśī* is excellent for the worship of *Nārāyaṇa*. The inner spiritual centers related to Lord *Vishṇu* blossom naturally on that day. Just as a favourable wind helps a traveller, mother nature helps a *Sādhaka* to advance in the inward spiritual path. *‘Gāḷi Bandāga Tūriko’*, \(Rush your way when the wind blows favourably\) is a proverb in *Kannada*. On this analogy, one should utilize the facility provided by nature and worship god in a special way and should obtain the desired accomplishments. This indeed is the intention of the *Jnānis*.

And now about *Jāgaraṇa* during the night. Generally people work during the day and spend the night in sleep. No doubt sleep is very good for health. But *śāstras* prescribe that the night hours of *Ekādaśī* should not be squandered in sluggish sleep, and restraint should be exercised. And *Jāgaraṇa* should be observed as long as possible even on that night, for the purpose of remaining in the divine *Bhāva* which facilitates a slothless sleep, ie.* Brahmasamādhi*.

This observance of *Jāgaraṇa* is prescribed only to worship God with full devotion which is said to be nine fold viz. *Śrāvaṇa*, *Kīrtana*, *smaraṇa*, *Pādapūja*, *Arcana*, *Vandana*, *Dāsya, Sakhya* and *Ātmanīvedana*. And it should be noted that *Jāgaraṇa* \(keeping oneself awake\) is not an end in itself. During *Jāgaraṇa* one is supposed to be engaged in activities which nourish a divine *Bhāva*. But some people, under the wrong impression that *puṇya* is obtained anyway by merely keeping themselves awake during that time, engage themselves in either sports/entertainments or quarrel mongering. This is unscriptural and even amounts to *Adharma*. By this, the desired auspicious attainment is lost and the accrual of the unwished shall follow. Those who cannot afford a total fast, should keep awake as long as possible and should achieve *Jāgaraṇa* spiritually. If for any reason/s *Jāgaraṇa* happens to cause impairment either to one’s health or meditation, it is better to resort to sleep.

### Discussion on fasting—
#### Literal meaning
**\(1\) Literal meaning: —** Generally fasting means abstaining from food and drinks. Scriptures explain that abstaining from food and drinks externally, happens to be one of the external features connected with fasting.

“यज्ञेन तपसा अनाशकेन \(बृ. उ. IV-4-22\)   
> एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि” \(कात्यायन\) 

This *vrata* is also known by the names *‘upavāsa’*, *‘upavāsanam’ ‘aupvastam’. ‘Uposhitam’* and *‘uposhanam’*. As there are several meanings for verb roots, the meaning viz. abstaining from food has come to stay, says the *amarasudhākara* “अनेकार्थत्वादभोजने वृत्तिः” भोजनविरहस्य”, Though these meanings are in usage, some more important aspects come to light when their *avayavārthas* are examined. The words *‘upavāsa’*, *‘upavasana’* mean living closer. \(वस निवासे, उप समीपे वासः\)

The word *Upavastā* means one who remains near and causes a stoppage. And that act of his is called *‘aupavasta’.* \(वस्तुस्तम्भे, उपवस्तुः कर्म औपवस्तम्\)

The *avayavārtha* of *Uposhitam*, and *Uposhaṇam’* is burning by remaining very close. \(*usha—dāhe*\). When these meanings are taken in connection with the *vrataniyamas*, questions such as, closer to whom should one live? In whose company should one remain? What should be arrested? What should get burnt etc? arise. The answers that are obtained naturally to these questions are as follows: One should remain close to God; should possess *Ātmaguṇas,* should restrain the senses inactive, and should cause the bad deeds and the bad *samskāras* to get burnt down.

> उपावृत्तस्य पापेभ्यो यस्तु वासो गुणैस्सह ।   
> उपवासस्स विज्ञेयो न शरीरस्य शोषणम् ॥ 

\(To cease from sinful activities and to be in the company of *Āthmaguṇas* itself is *upavāsa*. *Upavāsa* is not merely oppressing the body\).

कथाद्या गीतिका विष्णोर्गायन् विष्णुपरायणः ॥

\(One should keep singing the praises and stories of *Śrīhari*, “पापालस्यादि वर्जितम्” \(one should keep off from sinful acts and laziness etc.\)—*Śāstravākyas* like these support this opinion.

In that case why did the term *‘upavāsa’* come to mean “giving up of food?” It is because, when one keeps himself close to God, he remains in the *Paramātmasamādhi,* having burnt down both *puṇya* and *pāpa,* and has his senses inactive, he needs no food. The very sense organ ie the tongue, which tastes food and drinks, becomes powerless. The *Jnānendriyas* \(viz. the sense organs which perceive sound, touch, form, taste and smell\) get still. Thus in the real sense, it will be a state of total fast. And so, the fasting done externally symbolizing the *upavāsa* within, comes to be called *‘Upavāsa’*. Also, the absence of food in the body, and the absence of digestion of food fecilitate meditation, and to remain close to God. This also has been a reason to make the word *‘upavāsa’* to aptly connote the sense of abstainment from taking food externally. Even the act of fasting that helps *‘upavāsa’*, is also *‘upavāsa’*.

**\(2\) Why should one fast?**

When a person goes on fast at regular intervals, the body becomes free from ailments. ‘लङ्घनं परमौषधम्’ says the *āyurveda*. This is a fact established by experience also. But the fasting prescribed as a part of the ritual, does not just result in bestowing health alone. No doubt health is very essential for meditation. “अनामयी यावदात्मानं सम्मन्यते”. But fasting helps *Dhyāna* in other ways also.

When food is consumed, the digestive organs and the mind get engaged in digesting the food and preventing the wear and tear of the body and helping in it’s upkeep. If they are ordered to stop their work and asked to function in a unidirectional disposition facilitating meditation, they may spite and deprecate. If forced to act they can hamper both *pravrtti* and *Nivṛtti* So, for a distinct period of time, they should be provided with rest from functions like digestion. Then they become capable of meditating on Good unidirectionally.

Another excellent way is to provide both the senses and the mind the objects of their desire and making them totally focussed on God. For example, the work \(and object of desire\) of the tongue is talking, and hearing is the work of the ears. By directing them respectively to sing the glory of God and to listen to the stories of God and making them work accordingly, one is helped to lodge himself close to God. If the body remains light because of abstaining from food, it helps in the *‘upavāsa’* in the form of service to God by the senses to God.

P.V. Kāṇe, a well known critic says, “The principle of fasting on *Ekādaśī* is spiritual in nature. It is a discipline of the mind. A fast observed willingly with enthusiasm and happiness removes the beastly feelings from the mind and makes it capable of receiving the grace of god.” But he has not explained how it happens. But it is indeed commendable that he notes that fasting should be undertaken with enthusiasm.

On the whole, it should be importantly remembered that fasting is a means like *jāgaraṇa* for the purpose of worship of God and *Yoga*, and not an end in itself.

In this very sense, *Mahātmas* have preached thus—“Don’t be a slave to fasting. Use it as your servant and make it a ladder to ascend to the divine *Bhāva*.”

While praising the glory of *Śrīmadbhāgavatam,* the *Padmapurāṇa* says, “If fasting becomes a hindrance to listen to the stories of God, it is not good. Comparably, the food that helps a person to listen to the glory of God, is commendable”. This should be remembered in this context.

भोजनं तु वरं मन्ये कथाश्रवणकारकम्

Some people deride “It is ludicrous to advise Indians to fast. Because most of the people have to generally fast due to lack of food. It amounts to cruetly to advise them to remain hungry as they can get only a small quantity of food some how.”—This is incorrect because if someone stays hungry due to lack of food, displeasure, ostentation etc., it can never be an *upavāsa* endorsed by the *śāstras*.

#### Who should not observe fast?

Those who feel weak mentally or those who happen to suffer from ill—health due to fasting, should not observe fast at all. Scriptures clearly state that it amounts to sin, if children below the age of eight years, old people above eighty, patients whose life span gets reduced because of fasting, and pregnant women observe fast. And if people whose body conditions get disturbed due to fasting and consequently tend to think only of food instead of focussing on God, they will not benefit by fasting.

The *śāstras* also say that going on fast for no reason amounts to an act of offence against God. Because, by that the share of *Havis* which should reach the deities such as *prāṇa* etc would be missed by them. And, on days when exhaustion is caused because of inevitable physical work, fasting should not be done. Also, fasting is not a must for those who are in some distinct paths of *Yoga*. By excessive fasting they may encounter hindrances in their *sādhana*. Fasting need not be forced on such people. It need not be enforced also on great souls who are *Brahmasiddhas* and who are always immersed in *Ātmasantosha* which happens to be the ultimate benefit of fasting. They have, in this regard, the right to act according to the dictates of their inner self.** We humbly remember here the command of *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* who said—“Instructions such as “Take the medicine. Follow the diet. Don’t consume curds” etc., are meant for the sick. Healthy persons need not be bound by them. But even a healthy person may follow them to set a good example for the world.**” Also, we are reminded of the words of *Dharmaśāstra*s which say “One should not come to a conclusion based merely as the words of *śāstras*. If the judgement happens to be devoid of reasoning, it results in *Dharmahāni* only

> केवलं शास्त्रमाश्रित्य न कर्तव्यो विनिर्णयः ।   
युक्तिहीने विचारे तु धर्महानिः प्रजायते”॥ 

#### What may be done by weak persons?

What should weak persons do on the day of observance of religious fasting? Those who cannot afford to fast for the whole day, may observe a partial fast. They may eat during the day and fast at night or vice versa. Both are approved by the *śāstras*. This option pertaining to the observance of the relevant *vrata* may be followed by a person depending upon his physical and mental dispositions.

Those who cannot observe complete fast may take light food. But the food thus taken should be *sāttvik* in nature. And even such a food should be taken in a small quantity, taking care to see that it will not impede the worship of God. *Śāstras* say that such persons can take water, milk, fruits, curds, ghee, bulbous roots, sweet potato or *havishyānna* etc. Uncooked food items may be taken in a limited quantity. The food thus taken should not cause intoxication but should make the body and mind feel light. We come across advices which suggest that direct rice preparations should not be taken but preparations made from modified rice \(i.e. rice in the fried or broken form\) can be consumed in a limited quantity. But, taking advantages of this concession, some people heavily consume many kinds of foods and *citrānnas* \(spicy rice mixes\), drink a variety of beverages, and yet feel they have observed *upavāsavrata*. An adage in kannada *“Annakke mūru mānavādare appaccige āru māna”* \(It is three measures for rice but six for tiffins\) is superbly proved by them\! The *Phalāhāra vrata* of such people is indeed a *vrata* of *halavu Āhāra* \(*kannada—Many foods*\). A skit goes like this: A person asks the other ‘who is that, seated behind the heap of *uppittu?* \(cooked broken wheat cereal\). “I am *Subbiah* here. Don’t you know that I am observing *Ekādāśi vrata”*? This counter question itself served as the answer. No wonder, satires such as:

*“Āce mane subbammanorge Ekādaśi Upavāsa Ello svalpa tintārante Uppittu Avalakki pāyasa\!”* have come up.

\(A Kannada poem which means *Subbamma*, the neighbour is observing a fast on account of *Ekādaśī*. She eats something very little; cooked wheat cereal, flattened rice and *payasa*\).

\(This is the grandeur of just the breakfast on *Ekādaśī*\!\)

No need to explain that pompous *phalāhāras* like these are unscriptural. But, taking medicine and, following the words of a *Jnāni* \(to take some food\), do not amount to breaking of the vow of *Ekādaśī*\)

> अष्टैतान्यव्रतघ्‌नानि आपोमूलं घृतं पयः ।   
> हविः ब्राह्मणकाम्या च गुरोर्वचनमौषधम् ॥ 

If one follows as per the advice of an *Acārya* who is a *Jnānavijnāna tṛptātma,* he shall obtain the grace of god. Medication leads to good health. As both of these happen to be the benefits and limbs of religious fasting, *śāstras* advise as said above.

#### Rules that are helpful in fasting

Those who observe fast should also observe strict *brahmacarya*. Their minds, words and deeds should be pure. It is best to observe total silence on that day. We wish to quote an instance where a person happened to cause the spread of an unsavoury effect by indulging in loose talk, without caring to follow a rule of this *vrata* called *Mouna*. \(silence\)

A few boys were having meals on an *Ekādaśī*. An elderly person beaming with happiness resulting from a heavy *phalāhāra*, happened to come there. Enjoying both the sight and the smell of the meals which the boys were having, he quoted a line from the *Dharma śāstra* and chided. “You are eating a meal on an *Ekādaśī* and it amounts to eating dog poop,” and created a disgusting feeling both in the mind of the boys and in his own *prakṛti* \(disposition\).

We have come across some ignoble practices in some houses where fasting is observed, such as abstaining from taking the daily bath till evening on the day of *Ekādaśi* because of the fear of the very thought of food after bath, indulging in reading stories and novels which abound in wordly *bhāvas* instead of listening to the stories of God, and reproaching others etc. No need to emphasise that these have to be totally given up.

*Ekādaśī* is a highly sacred *Mahāparva*. One should worship Lord *Nārāyaṇa* both internally and externally on that day. We feel that acts like abstaining from food or limited intake of food as per the guidelines of the *śāstras* and observing *jāgaraṇa* which fecilitate such a worship, conform to the *śāstras*.

In the *Bhagavadgīta*, Lord *Kṛshṇa* says—

> विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।   
> रसवर्जं रसोप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥ 

\(A person, who observes *upavāsa* without providing food for his body, mind and the senses, gets freed from *śabda* \(sensation of sound\) and *sparśa* \(sensation of touch\) and other sensations; but *Rasa* \(desire\) for worldly pleasure does not leave him. When he visualizes God, even that desire leaves him\).

Therefore it is good to keep our sense organs away from the objects of their desire on *Ekādaśī,* and make them fast. And, rather than just stopping at that, if one meditates on god and visualises him, even the desire for the worldly pleasures dries up. Such a person refuge in god who is a *Paramānanda Rasasvarūpi* \(An embodiment of the essence of highest bliss\). For the sake of the achievement of such a *paramapurushārtha* \(the greatest goal of life\), fasting should be done on that day.





	 
## Śrī Rāmanavamī

*Śrī Rāmanavamī* is the most important festival which comes in the month of *Caitra*, just after *Ugādi*. It is one of the great festivals which is being celebrated right from *Rāmasetu* to *Himālayas* by people belonging to all *varṇas* and *āśrmas* and who follow the *Āryasamskṛti*. On this day, the tradition is to get absorbed in *Rāma* by various observances such as doing of *Pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa* in Sanskrit and regional languages, listening to the story of *Rāma*, presenting the story in dance, music and musical instruments, worshipping of *Rāma* in homes, *maṭhas* and temples with many *pūjās* and *upacāras*, observing a fast which fecilitates to meditate upon HIM and/or taking the *Prasāda* \(*Naivedya*\) after the *pūja*, to obtain his grace.

There is also a tradition of starting the worship of *Rāma* on the day of *Ugādi* itself, culminating in a special worship offered on the day of *Rāmanavamī*. After an elaborate delineation of *Ugādi*, we will now start making an inquiry in an orderly form to acquaint the society with the festival of *ŚrīRāmanavamī* which too can be a legitimate subject matter of inquiry.

Is *Rāma* who is worshipped in this festival, a God Or a human being? or an ideal human being, who has won the hearts of people by his deeds that match the noble qualities in him, and thus respectfully remembered? It is natural that such a question arises at the outset, when the discernment \(into the topic\) is taken up.

Some worship *ŚrīRāma* as *Parādevatā*. He is the God of all gods. “तमीश्वराणां परमं महेश्वरं तं देवतानां परमं च दैवतम्” \(श्वेताश्वतर 6-7\) “I do not know any other god except Him. \(“नान्यं दैवं नैव जाने न जाने”\) O\! *Rāma* \! I do not want any other god in whose name the word *Rāma* does not occur. “अरामाभिधेत्यैरलं दैवतैर्नः” \(श्रीङ्करभगवत्पाद, रामभुजङ्गप्रयातस्तोत्र\) Some say that you are only a human being and not the ultimate god\! If it is so, I would like to remain an atheist. Forgive me my lord”. \(*Sāketa Mahākāvya-I*\) These are the utterances of *Vīrabhaktas* \(heroic devotees\) who worship him. Devotees also feel emotionally that *ŚrīRāma* is the incarnation of *Śuddhabrahmaparātpara Parañjyoti.* Some also worship him as a supreme devotee of *Mahādeva* renowned as *Rāmeśvara*.

Some others consider him as the best among humans, the destroyer of the evil and a savior of the good, an invincible hero, a protector of *Ārya Dharma* and a great emperor. “Though a human being, a great soul who ascended to the state of *Nārāyaṇa* by his character’. ‘The supreme human being whose personality blossomed as he emerged a victor crossing the trials, temptations and weaknesses and thus is respectfully established in the hearts of all human beings who look for an ideal person.” “The evolution that is discernible of *ŚrīRāma’s* personality in his particular milieu, through trials, temptations and weaknesses is to be contrasted with the notion of his incarnation as a perfect being.” \(V.S.S. *Śāstry-* lectures on the *Rāmāyaṇa*\). Some say he was an eminent personage who really existed. Some others say that he is just a great hero in the epics.

He is a *“Mahāpurusha”* by any count, call him a god or consider him a human being who ascended to the state of god. \(The word *Mahāpurusha* means the greatest of men or the supreme man or *Paramātma.* The opinions of some totally lay persons who make a ‘mere superficial discernment, and state that *Rāma* was unrighteous and a dictator, have not been quoted here.\) One may think “The respect accorded to that divine person remains the same, whether one considers him a God in the form of a human being or a human being who rose to the state of God by his conduct. If that is the case, what is the necessity of deliberation to know whether he was God incarnate or a man who ascended to Godhood?” Though at the first instant both appear to be one and the same, an acute discernment tells us the clear difference between the two.

If he happens to be really a God, he shall be the auspicious refuge for those who meditate upon Him, and a benefactor that bestows on his devotees both material happiness and *Moksha*. Then it can be concluded that his divine auspicious form is *nityaśuddhabuddha muktasvarūpa.* It \(i.e. His form\) shall remain the same in all the three time frames i.e. before, during and after the incarnation. Its existence will always be there. If he were to be a mere human being, and later emerged as a great *yogi* by obtaining *Siddhi* through *tapas, yoga* and *samādhis,* and thus even if he were to be adorable, his form would not have the divine qualities cited above such as *Nityatva, Nirvikāratva,* capacity to be an auspicious refuge, and power to bless etc, in the same level. And if he were to be only a pious king of pure life who lived in the past or a mere character in compositions, people no doubt become religious by remembering the ideals \(in him\) and emulate him. Though this is desirable, the *Mahimā* of this may not reach the level of the two *pakshas* stated above.

Here, the difference of *pakshas*, even from the point of view of the effect of \(observing\) this festival on us, is noteworthy. If it were to be a day of the birth of a great human leader, it shall undoubtedly be an auspicious day which would provide a religious or a spiritual inspiration to the people who follow him in the deep faith. On the other hand, if it happens to be the day of incarnation of the Lord of the worlds, it shall be a supreme nodal day, which casts its influence on all the living beings.

The arguments advanced by those who are of the view that *ŚrīRāma* is not an incarnation of God, can be summed up as follows:

a\) There can be no such thing as an incarnation of God. It is against reason and against *Śāstras* to think God incarnates because—

I\) *Avatāra* means a descent. It is wrong to think that God descends from his exalted position to places like the earth etc., and to think that that itself is an *‘avatāra’*.

God is omnipresent. There is no place where God does not exist. “नित्यं विभुं सर्वगतं सुसूक्ष्मम्” \(मुण्डक १-१-६\) “महान्तं विभुमात्मानं मत्वा धीरो न शोचति” “व्यापकोऽलिङ्ग एव च” \(कठ ४-२-४, ६, ५, ८\) “सर्वव्यापिनमात्मानम्” \(श्वेताश्व १-७६\) “अन्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्य नारायणः स्थितः” \(नारायणोपनिषत्\) “व्याप्य सर्वानिमान् लोकान् स्थितः सर्वत्र केशवः” \(हरिवंश\)

When such is the case, where does he descend from? If ever he descends, does his original place become vacant? And where does he descend at all? All these cannot happen. Even to say that the word ‘descending’ denotes entering a womb, it is also not possible. For example, the sky is all pervading. If one says, “It entered the womb” “It was held in the fist” etc., can it be possible? It can neither go in or come out. In the same way God is omnipresent and infinite. There is no question of God coming \(in\) or going \(out\) ever. “It is not possible to come and go to a place where he does not reside. If one says he entered the womb from somewhere, was he not there before? If one says he has come out, was he not there outside earlier?” \(*Satyartha Prakasa-7*\)

Therefore God has no entrance or exit. Even the *Avatāravāda* that expounds his incarnations, can be likened to a mansion without foundation, which eventually collapses.

ii\) Incarnation refers to God assuming a human or an animal form. To think so, it amounts to offending truth, because taking birth is a *vikāra.* One who is born like that must die, and it is also a *vikāra*. God is one who has no *vikāra*. स्त्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म \(तै. उ. सत्यं निर्विकारम्\) “अविकार्योऽयमुच्यते” \(गीता ३ अध्याय\) “निष्कलो निरञ्जनो निर्विकल्पो निराख्यातः शुद्धो देव एको नारायणः” \(नारायण उ. \) “अविकाराय शुद्धाय नित्याय परमात्मने” \(विष्णुसहस्रनाम, उपो\) “अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणः” \(गीता 7 अध्याय,\) “अज एकपात्” \(कठ 2-18\). “सपर्यगाच्छुक्रमकायमव्रणं” \(वा. सं. 34-53\) Therefore, to think for any reason \(and state\) that he takes a birth is an offence to God.

iii\) For what purpose indeed should God take an incarnation? One may say that God incarnates to destroy invincible demons like *Hiraṇayakaśipu*, *Hiraṇyāksha, Rāvaṇa* etc. If so, many questions may arise, such as, is not God omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent? “परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च” “यः सर्वज्ञः सर्ववित् यस्य ज्ञानमयं तपः” *Rāvaṇa* and others beings like him are nothing but worms before the all powerful creator. Should he descend to the world assuming only a human form to kill such persons? Couldn’t he have destroyed them without incarnation? God who dwells inside all, could have cut \(slashed\) the vital parts of their body from within, resulting in their death. Is it difficult for that great power, which performs awesome acts such as creation, sustenance and destruction, to kill these creatures without assuming a physical form? Should he descend to attend to small jobs like these, setting aside the many big occupations pertaining to the universe?

Again, God is present even in the wicked demons. “एष त आत्मा अन्तर्याम्यमृतम्” He could have bestowed wisdom from within to repulse their demonic nature.

If it is supposed that God should incarnate to uplift \(protect\) his devotees, is it not possible for him to do so, even without taking a birth, as cited above?

Therefore, no specific use is seen for his incarnations. \(“The divinity would exercise its importance without employing human agency for its ends and incarnations will be unnecessary.” p.xiv. T.R.V. Śāstry\) Therefore, even the *avatāravāda* advanced for the Lord’s incarnations becomes useless.

b\) Further, *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* is the greatest authority on the story of *ŚrīRāma*. In that work itself it is stated that *Rāma* was a human being, however great he was. He is clearly described as *Naravyāghra* and *Naraśārdūla*. For example, in the very first canto itself, *Vālmīki* asks sage *Nārada*-“Is there any human being in the world who possesses all the auspicious qualities you have enumerated?” *Nārada* replies, “O Sage, you have referred to a number of auspicious qualities that are rare. But I know of a human being who possesses these qualities. He is renowned as *Rāma*, born in the *Ikshvāku* lineage. \(मुने वक्ष्याम्यहं बुद्ध्वा तैर्युक्तः श्रूयतां नरः” वा. रा. बालकाण्डः सर्ग १\) And, *Rāma* himself declares before gods.—“I am a human being, the son of *Daśaratha”* \(आत्मानं मानुषं मन्ये रामं दशरथात्मजम् ॥ वा. रा. युद्धकाण्डः 120-12\) Is any other proof necessary to conclude that *Rāma* was a human being?

ii\) As a human being, *ŚrīRāmacandra* shares joys and sorrows with persons dear to him. At the separation of the beloved ones, he pours out his boundless sorrow. All these are natural acts of human beings. If all these are to be considered as mere drama, then the whole description \(of such acts\) appears artificial. And *Rāmāyaṇa* becomes a *Kāvya* without essence. Also it loses the poetic potential to provide direction, message and guidance to people.

iii\) If *ŚrīRāma* is considered a human being, it adds lustre to his character. We can recall an amiable criticism of a scholar who said—“There are people who critically discern at his conduct and point out the flaws and lapses in him. On the other hand, those who accept him as god, consider his conduct appropriate to the divine incarnation. And they try to justify his flaws and deficiencies as only good \(qualities\), and go to praise that the pain and pleasure of that divine soul is a pretence fitted into a human form. If we consider him as only a hero of the epic, we may come to regard how great a soul he is. When we come across one or two flaws in him, we bring to our mind his hundred virtues and withdraw from making a great issue of one mistake .” \(*Ādikavi Vālmīki*\)

iv\) He is God, an incarnation of Lord *Mahāvishṇu* himself. In many places in the *Rāmāyaṇa* it is declared—“विष्णोरर्धं महाभागम्” “जज्ञे विष्णुः सनातनः”, isn’t it? To this, it can replied that such statements either appear at the beginning or at the end. So they are only interpolations, added at a later time.

Therefore, at the time of writing the epic he was considered only as a great human being. After a long time he was thought of as Lord *Vishṇu* and became an object of that worship.

Those who argue that he was a human being, interpret that no hoary tradition is there to support the belief that *ŚrīRāma* was god. In the authentic parts of *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa*, *Rāma* is considered to be an ideal human being only. *Buddhist Jātaka* literary works and *Jaina Rāmāyaṇas* have described *ŚrīRāma* vividly as an ideal human being. The *Amarakośa* which is of recent origin, mentions the word *Kṛshṇa* and his other names as incarnations of *Kṛshṇa*, as synonyms of Lord *Vishṇu*. But neither the name of *Rāma* nor the names of *Rāmāvatāra* are considered similarly. So the concept of *Rāmāvatāra* appeared only much later than the era in which *Kṛshṇa* was considered as an incarnation—This is the reasonable argument supported by reason, advanced by them.

Further, their criticism tells that both the dignity of the poet *Vālmīki* and the poetic value of *Rāmāyaṇa* have been affected ever since the worship of *Rāma* began, not as a hero of a poetic work, but as god. And because of that, *Rāmāyaṇa* got reduced predominantly to the state of a religious piece of literature. Consequently, a great composition which should have enjoyed wide publicity in all the civilized parts of the world got bound to just one country. “And that too, it became a composition wanted by only a small population in the country. A man who should have been an emperor became a village chieftain. A precious thing which should have been useful to a lot of people became the possession of a few” This is their argument which points, out a flaw also in the *Phalasruti.*

A *śloka* recited in our tradition, says that *Rāma* is an incarnation of *Nārāyaṇa*. When that Supreme Lord incarnated as the son of *Daśaratha,* the *Vedas* also incarnated directly in the form of *Rāmāyaṇa*, because of *Vālmīki*. The *śloka* is as follows:—

> वेदवेद्ये परे पुंसि जाते दशरथात्मजे ।  
> वेदः प्राचेतसादासीत्‌साक्षाद्रामायणात्मना ॥ 

But the proponents of the theory which states that *Rāma* was a human being, interpret the *śloka* in a different way, construing the words differently. They construe the words as “दशरथात्मजे वेदवेद्ये परे पुंसि जाते” and interpret it as follows-As the son of *Daśaratha* \(in the minds of people in the course of time\) got transformed into the state of the Supreme Lord who can be known by the *Vedas*, an impression got established that the *Vedas* incarnated in the form of *Rāmāyaṇa* through *Vālmīki* \(*Śrī Kuppusvamy Śāstry* in the introduction of *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* in the Law journal edition\)

Thus, we had a look at a number of arguments which \(try to\) substantiate that *Rāma*, the hero of *Rāmāyaṇa* is a mere human being. Now, after going through the arguments of the opponents of this view, a comparison is to be made.

After having looked at the arguments which state that *Rāma* was a human being, the argument that he is \(none other than\) Lord *Nārāyaṇa* himself can be discerned now. At the outset it has to be examined whether the word *Rāma* can qualify to be \(termed\) a synonym for the word *Nārāyaṇa*.

*Vedas* very clearly state that *Nārāyaṇa* is *Paratattva, Parañjyoti, Paramātma* and *Parabrahma*.

> नारायण परं ब्रह्म तत्त्वं नारायणः परः ।  
नारायण परो ज्योतिरात्मा नारायणः परः ॥\(महानारायणोपनिषत्\) 

The *Upanishads* declare unequivocally that the term *Rāma* also refers to *Parabrahma*. “इति रामपदेनासौ परम्ब्रह्माभिधीयते” \(रामतापिन्युपनिषत्\).

The word *Rāma* is derived from the root *Ram* which means “To play” Thus the world *Rāma* means one who plays. “रमते इति रामः” or One who causes the joy of play. “रमयति इति रामः” It also means the one who delights in the hearts of *the Yogis*, or the one in whose heart the *yogis* delight. \(“रमते योगिहृन्मध्ये इति रामः”, “सार्थकार्णद्वयं रामो रमन्ते यत्र योगिनः” \(रामरहस्योपनिषत्\) It means “रमन्ते योगिनोऽनन्ते नित्यानन्दे चिदात्मनि” \(रामार्चनी\)

*Yogis* are *atmārāmas*, *atmakrīdas*, and those who have *ātmarati*. *ŚrīRāma* who is the source of their joy, cannot be anything else other than that *Ātmasvarūpa*. *Rāma* is *Abhirāma*. Sage *Vālmīki says—*

“अभिरामस्य रामस्य चरितं कर्तुमुद्यतः”

\(*Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, Balakaṇḍa* canto 3\) He is pleasing to the eyes “तदेव रम्यं परमनयनोत्सवकारणं सकलनिष्कलं आपोज्योतिस्स्थसलं नारायणस्थलं चेति योगशास्त्रेषु प्रसिद्धम्” \(श्रीङ्कराचार्य, राजयोगभाष्य\). Is he not the Lord whom the *Mahāyogis* have seen by their own eyes? The *Upanishads* praise him indeed as *“Satyātmaprāṇārāmam mana ānadam”*

Some more symbolical meanings such as “He lighted up the earth by his incarnation, is the cause of destruction of the *asuras*, a giver of *dharma*, *jnāna*, *vairāgya* & *wealth*. “राजते मह्यामिति रामः” “राक्षसा मरणं यान्ति अनेन इति रामः” “राति ददाति धर्ममार्गं चरित्रेण ज्ञानमार्गं नामतः वैराग्यं ध्यानेन ऐश्वर्यं च स्वस्य पूजनात् इति रामः”-are also being stated.

Thus the word *Rāma* is in complete agreement with the meanings which express the features and auspicious qualities of the almighty. And so, there can be no doubt about the capacity of the word *Rāma* to stand for the almighty.

And now, it has to be discussed whether the great person *ŚrīRāma*, described as the hero by the *Maharshis* in the *ādikāvya, purāṇas* and *itihāsas* etc., was an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. At the outset, the *pramāṇas* which are taken to measure the divinity have also to be decided. Because, *Jnānis* say that God is *Aprameya* “अमेयोमितलोकस्त्वं” \(रघुवम्श सर्ग 10\) beyond measure and beyond proofs.”

It is impossible to know him by the ocular proof which are used to measure gross matter. He is not knowable by the sense organs.

न सन्दृशे तिष्ठति रूपमस्य न चक्षुषा पश्यति कश्च नैनम् \(महानारायण\)

“यत्तदद्रेश्यमग्राह्यम्” “न शक्यः चक्षुषा द्रष्टुं देहे सूक्ष्मतमो विभुः”

He is not visible to the external human eyes. So if one tries to see him with external eyes and says that he does not exist, it cannot be taken as an authority. Even if one says that he exists, the statement carries no value. If one has to behold god, he must have divine eyes. That eye is called the *jnāna netra* and the eye of *tapas*.

“दृश्यते ज्ञानचक्षुर्भिः तपश्चक्षुर्भिरेव च”

Only the experience obtained by such inner eyes can become the supreme evidence which can determine the divinity.

Let us understand the conclusion with the help of the teachings of ŚrīRañgamahāguru, which is both an elixir of own experience and adorned by reasoning.

***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru* had analyzed that the discernments are of two types viz., *Bhramādṛshṭi* and *Pramādṛshṭi*. Only those possessing the *Pramādṛsṭi*, he would say, were indeed the ones who had the right grasp \(of things\). Such persons, who have the vision of truth accomplished with the help of such a grasp, can be termed *Āptas*. The word *āpta* does not stand for “Intimate persons and well wishers in everyday life,” as comprehended by laymen in a limited sense. It means *“Śishṭas* and *jnānis*, who possess pure knowledge unaffected in the three time frames, \(who have\) cast off *rajas* and *tamas* completely, with the power of *tapas* and *jnāna”***

रजस्तमोभ्यां निर्मुक्ताः तपोज्ञानबलेन ये ।  
> येषां त्रिकालममलं ज्ञानमव्याहतं सदा ॥  
> आप्ताश्शिष्टा विबुद्धास्ते तेषां वाक्यमसंशयम्” 

The matter whether Rāma was God or an incarnation of God can be decided only from their point of view.

*Śāstras* regard the śishṭas \(refined men\) and jnānis in this way. Till the time such a *dṛshṭi* is obtained, one has to depend on the words of great souls who have spiritual experiences. Śāstras term this evidence as “Āaptavākyapramāṇa” Will such great souls whose abode is śuddhasatva, utter untruth at all? “सत्यं वदन्ति ते कस्मादसत्यं नीरजस्तमाः”. Only when one attains the spiritual enlightenment by reposing faith in their words with discrimination, follows the path taught by them and obtains *jnānasiddhi*, the big enigma gets solved. In this way the words of these *jnānis* too, become an important evidence to measure the ultimate truth.

When a person is engaged in the *Sādhana* in this way, pure logic and thinking also is needed to guard the mind from doubts. And, inference, which is in accordance with true experience and free from faults, can also be considered as a proof. Since reasoning very much depends upon the talent of the logician, there is no guarantee that truth can be found out for sure.

“तर्के नैवास्ति निश्चयः\(श्रीशङ्कराचार्य सदाचारस्तोत्र\)  
“तर्काप्रतिष्ठानात्”\(ब्र. सू. II-1\) 

“नैषा तर्केण मतिरापनेया” \(कठोप II-9\) With all this, if that reasoning fosters that *āptavacana*, it is also considered a proof “श्रुतिमतस्तर्कोऽनुसन्धीयतां” \(उपदेशपञ्चक\) “यस्तर्केणानुसन्धत्ते स धर्मं वेद नेतरः” \(मनुस्मृति 12-106:\) “युक्तिहीने विचारे तु धर्महानिः प्रजायते” \(स्मृति चं\)

On the whole, all these, viz experience based on spiritual knowledge, *āptavacanas* leading to that experience and supportive reasoning-are needed to conclude whether *Rāma* happens to be an incarnation of God.

\(Vedantasāra says that for confirmation, one needs Sruṭi, Yukti and Anubhava.\) Among these, the first one does not apply to literature. Therefore we shall consider the other two for this purpose.

God has incarnations. Do we have the proof of *Āpatavākya* to prove that *ŚrīRāma* is also one of such incarnations? Let us discuss this now.

“God incarnates in different ways, without taking birth \(ie without the stains associated with birth and life\)”

“अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते” \(यजुर्वेद पुरुषसूक्त\)

“One who praises his birth, is indeed the blessed one” declare the *Śrutis.*

“यो जातमस्य महतो महि ब्रवात्” \(*Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa*\) In the *Gītā*, which in itself is the embodiment of the *Upanishads, Brahmavidya,* and *yogaśāstra*, Lord *Kṛshṇa* the greatest *āpta* declares with a vow—“Whenever *dharma* declines and *Adharma* rises up, I shall incarnate myself \(to protect *dharma* and destroy *adharma*.\) “Even though I am birthless, imperishable, and the Lord of all the creatures i.e. all the living beings, I shall keep the *Prakṛti* under my control and shall appear \(concealed\) in the veil of my *Maya”*

\(गीता. अ-४ श्लोक ७-६ “यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत । अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्” “अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥\)

God is not subject to *karma. Āpatavākyas* state clearly that such births and incarnations happen at the will of God, in certain specific times.

There are many such *āptavākyas* which support the view that *ŚrīRāma* also is one of such incarnations of god.

*Āptavākyas* pronounce that *ŚrīRāma* is the almighty god and an incarnation. The *Upanishads*, *Śrīmad Rāmāyaṇa*-the *ādikāvya* which is a form of *the Veda*, the *Mahābhārata* which is renowned as the fifth *veda* and also a great *Itihāsa*, the precious *purāṇas*, the words of *Alvars* who were preeminent *jnānis*, and the nectar like words and the songs of *Ācharyas* declare this truth clearly. We quote a few of them here:

In addition to this, it is well known that exalted personages like *Śrītulsīdāsa* the best in the clan of saints, *Śrī Thyāgarāja Svāmi* who became blessed by the experience of the ultimate through music and who was the king among *yogis*, and the supreme in *Rāmabhakti*, *ŚrīRāmadāsa* of *Bhadrācala* etc., have praised the glory of the divine incarnation of *ŚrīRāma* through compositions and songs, which are nothing but the elixir of their personal experience. When the above statements which are quoted as *āptavākyas* are subject to discerment, some doubts arise. Unless they \(the doubts\) are cleared, we may hesitate to repose trust in their credibility. These doubts are as follows:-

1. The statements quoted from the *Upanishads* are not very ancient like the *Ṛg-Veda samhita*. Even the *upanishads* \(quoted above\) do not figure in the ten *Upanishads* like *Īśāvāsyā*, which are regarded as authority by the *Ācāryas* in their commentaries of the *prasthānatraya*. They are books of a later date. Can they be termed as *āptavākyas* when they are not revered by the ancient traditions? 
2. The above *ślokas* quoted from the *Rāmāyaṇa* were not found in the original body of the *Rāmāyaṇa*. They appear either at the beginning or at the end of *Rāmāyaṇa*. They are all interpolations added later. This conclusion becomes inevitable, even if we judge from the aspect of the style \(of that part of the epic\) “The part of the story taken to prove that *ŚrīRāma* is an incarnation seems to have a crack at such nodes.”-goes a remark. Can the status of *āptavākyas* be accorded to such artificially added and interpolated *ślokas*? 
3. The same argument is in the case of the *Mahābhārata* also. The whole of this epic is not the work of a single author. Interpolated *ślokas* have been added to the epic at different times. In that epic \(*Mahābhārata*\) the portions which describe *ŚrīRāma* and *Śrī Kṛshṇa*, are the added ones in the third stage of it’s composition, after the beginning of the Christian era. How can we indeed respect them as ancient *āptavākyas*? 
4. The *Ālvārs* also are of recent times. *Śrī Śaṅkara* and other *ācharyas* are also of recent times. *Śrī Tulasīdās* and *Tyāgarāja* came much later. Can we consider their words as *āptavākyas* on par with the *Vedas* etc which are very ancient?-These are those questions. 

If we take a look at the true characteristics of the term *āptavākya* in the right perspective, all the doubts vanish. *Āptavākya* means a statement which is conformable to truth. They are the words which emerge as a result of *tapas, jnāna* and *samādhi* for the benefit of all the living beings. The question of ancient or modern does not arise there at all. It is a sort of blind belief to say that all that is old is true. Such beliefs prevailed more in the olden days. The Poet laureate of *Bhārata*, the great *Kālidāsa*, boldly declared “पुराममित्येव न साधु सर्वम्’ \(*Mālavikāgnimitra*-introduction\) Contrastingly, in the present times, another kind of a blind belief, i.e. “All that is modern is truth.” is seen well rooted in many people.

This is another blind belief. “नवीनमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्” \(only because something is modern or new, it need not be entirely true\) is the message that has to be spread by us now. As a matter of fact, the seeker of truth should rout both types of blind beliefs. “Anything that emerges \(in a particular point of time\) will be new to that time. Later it becomes old. Therefore, this newness or oldness will not be a cause for any defect. Neither will be a cause for merit”-The following words of *Śrī Vedānta Deśika* can guide one towards proper judgement.

> तदात्वे नूतनं सर्वं आयत्यां च पुरातनम् ।  
> न दोषायैतदुभयं न गुणाय च कल्पते ॥\(यादवाभ्युदय, सर्ग घ\) 

“No one welcomes an ailment just because it is age-old and continues from generations. Either no one desires for some disease because it happens to be the latest. In the same way a superstition, whether new or old is to be given up; But a counsel regarding health matters or attaining amṛtatva is always sacred whether it is old or new”.—These were the words of our Mahāguru, which we recall here respectfully.

So, as the above sayings \(*āptavākyas*\) are endowed with the features of true experience, we honour it even if they happen to be old. We respect them even if they are new. Because, truth is ever ancient and ever new. After having respectfully accepted these *āptavākyas*, one should put them to test on the touchstone of *sādhana,* and only then they are to be adored completely. This is the path acceptable to the discerning persons.

Now from the point of view of history and literature it is difficult to conclude that the above quotes from the *Upanishads* are of recent origin. The observations made by looking at the language and style, can only be an opinion and not a conclusion. The strength of enlightenment is required to pronounce a verdict from the point of view of philosophical evolution, Bookish knowledge, linguistic cleverness or intellectual acrobatics will not work in such matters. *Kṛshṇopanishad* and *Rāmarahasyopanishad* deal with the experiences of *yoga*, which are beyond the cognizance of senses. Can we say for sure that these yogic experiences did not exist during the time of the composition of *Aithareyopanishad*? And so it is not right to assertively state that the *Upanishads* which mention these experiences are of recent origin. Further we cannot say with audacity that we have the complete collection of the texts of the *Vedas*. “We have no right to suppose that we have even one hundredth part of the religious and popular poetry that existed during the Vedic age.” \(Six systems of Indian Philosophy page 41\) says a modern critic of the *Vedas*.

When such is the case, how is it possible to judge whether the matters pertaining to the *Vedas* are modern or ancient?

Let us now examine the argument that the *ślokas* in the *Rāmāyaṇa* & *Mahābhārata* which depict *ŚrīRāma* as God, have been added very recently, and are only interpolations, and the authors of \(these two\) epics did not consider *ŚrīRāma* as God at all.

First, let us take up *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa*. Some critics who say that the *ślokas* which state that *ŚrīRāma* is an incarnation are later additions, advance the following reasons: There appears a wide gap between the original and these new additions in such portions. They appear like grafted limbs in a human body. And even without those portions, there would be no harm to the story.

Some critics who have studied the epic well, do not entertain the impression that these parts appear to be unnatural parts and are the grafted ones. They have found these as natural parts in the body of the epic. One of the modern scholars who has studied the human side of *ŚrīRāma’s* character in depth, writes clearly, *“Vālmīki’s* opinion was without doubt, that *ŚrīRāma* was God himself. The notion that the aspect of divinity was imposed on *ŚrīRāma’s* character later, is only a conjecture. The story told by *Vālmīki* thoroughly stands on the foundation of faith that *ŚrīRāma* is divine. This is indeed noteworthy. \(“Those who think that, to the kernel of the story representing *ŚrīRāma* as a man, subsequent ages added elements of divinity are only guessing, while the story itself, as it is told by *Vālmīki*, has this foundation on this faith and there is no mistake about it. *Vālmīki* says in so many words that *Rāma* was God.” \(Lectures on the *Rāmāyaṇa* by \(V.S.S. Shastry p. 5\)

How is it that the same topic can appear differently to the readers of *Rāmāyaṇa*? May be, it is because of differences in their *samskāras* and their views. If one looks at *ŚrīRāma’s* story with a firm impression that God can never take birth as a human being as it is unnatural, the parts of the story which refer to *ŚrīRāma* as divine, appear to have chinks. This is the result of their prejudice. When one looks at the story through the traditional pair of glasses of faith, that *ŚrīRāma* is God himself, those parts of the story appear to be naturally coherent. This also is a result of prejudice. Some people state that when *Rāmāyaṇa* was read for the first time without getting exposed to traditional education or criticism, it was felt that *Vālmīki’s Rāma* was God himself. Later, after reading some critical works, the parts which state his divinity, appear to be parts having fissures, and this is our opinion now. This is a kind of *‘pascima graha’*. Now without getting occupied by any kind of such prejudices, let us have a dip again and again, in the river of *Rāma’s* story which originated from the hills of *Vālmīki*. Let us recite the epic with faith and with the same poetic sensibilities of *Vālmīki*. Then only we should with an upright mind, spell out the impression obtained. Even when we observe from the viewpoint of the structure of the plot, the context of the story and style etc., we feel that many *ślokas* which state the divinity of *Rāma* are just the natural parts of *Rāmāyaṇa*.

If one wants to judge the true spirit of *Vālmīki* he has to have the \(inner\) vision of a *yogi*. It is because *Rāmāyaṇa* is an *ārshagrantha* only. Only from the vision of a sage, its purport can be stated. And with that vision alone, the reigning truth can be perceived, which is free from attributes such as space, time and personal likes \(and dislikes\) We have come across the *Āptas*, who are endowed with such a vision and they declare “We have experienced in reality, both the divine and the human form of *ŚrīRāma*. All men with such a vision can similarly experience *Him*.” Why should we argue that *Vālmīki* did not have such a vision?

		
One may say that the story of *Rāmāyaṇa* can continue even if the parts which state *Rāma* as God are dropped. In response, it can be said that only the human part of the story can continue. And \(it may be noted that\) even if some aspects in the human part are dropped then also the story will continue. For example let us assume a story written by a poet with a theme like this—In the past there was a king. Once he disguised himself and travelled to another country for some purpose. After participating in a number activities he returned to his homeland in his true real form.” “In this story, even if we drop the parts which delineate his kingship, his travelling to a different country in disguise and getting back, the rest of the story in itself may develop into a fine story. And just because of this, it wont be proper to assert that, only the disguised form of the king is his real form, the story related to that part only is genuine, and the remaining parts are interpolated.

Even to state that in the *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa*, the *ślokas* which depict *Rāma* as God, appear in the beginning and the ending parts of the epic and therefore they are interpolations, is not correct. Because even in other parts of the epic, one can find *ślokas* which suggest the divinity of *Rāma*. Example

1. The part where *ŚrīRāma* bestows higher worlds to *Jatāyu* and tells him “I have granted you permission to go to the higher worlds.” “मया त्वं समनुज्ञातो गच्छ लोकान् अनुत्तमान्” 
2. *Rāma’s* granting of a boon to a place called *marukāntāra*. “वरं तस्मै ददौ विद्वान् मरवेऽमरविक्रमः” “रामस्य वरदानाच्च शिवपन्था बभूव ह” \(*Yuddha kānḍa*; canto 22, *śloka* 41-43\) \(*Rāmāyaṇa* Edited by the Law Journal of India\). \(We can find many such examples\). 

Again a question may arise-

“The *ślokas* that depict the divinity of *Rāma* appear in abundance mostly either at the beginning or at the end part of the epic. The *ślokas* that explain the human aspect of *Rāma* are seen in a greater number in the remaining parts of the epic. What is the reason for this?” The answer to this question too is found in the story of the king given above as an example.

Further the *Rāmāyaṇa* says-Gods supplicated to *Mahāvishṇu*—*“Brahma* has granted a boon that *Rāvaṇa* cannot be killed by Gods. We have to honour that. Therefore you have to take incarnation as a human being and slay him.” The Lord granted the boon “so be it”, and by His own will, He was born as the son of King *Daśaratha*.

> तत्र त्वं मानुषो भूत्वा प्रवृद्धं लोककण्टकम् ।  
अवध्यं दैवतैर्विष्णो समरे जहि रावणम् ॥ 

वधाय देवशत्रूणां नृणां लोके मनःकुरु ।  
> मानुषं रूपमास्थाय रावणं जहि संयुगे ॥ 

> सन्तुष्टः प्रददौ तस्मै राक्षसाय वरं प्रभुः ।  
> नानाविधेभ्यो भूतेभ्यो भयं नान्यत्र मानुषात् ॥ 

> . . . . . . एवं दत्वा वरं देवो, देवानां विष्णुरात्मवान् ।  
> मानुषे चिन्तयामास जन्मभूमिमथात्मनः ॥  
\(बालकाण्ड, सर्ग 15-16, श्लोक 20-29, 3-61\) 

Therefore, it is appropriate that all his acts match the human behaviour, in the middle part of the epic. Or else it may appear like a weakness in the God of gods. A story is generally cited in this context as an example. The performance of the play *‘Dhruvanārāyaṇa’* was going on. The director of the company was playing the role of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. A small boy in that company was playing the role of *Dhruva*. The *Nārāyaṇa* of that drama told *Dhruva* ‘My son, ask me any boon \(and I will grant it to you.\)” Pat came the request from *Dhruva*, “Please grant me the salary of three months.” \(That young fellow was worried about the salary that was not paid to him for three months.\) Had *ŚrīRāma* indulged in revealing his divinity again and again in the middle of the epic, he too would have become a similar *“bacca”*. He would not have remained *‘Ātmavān’* He would have become a weightless person swayed by the force of senses and forgetting his vow and would cause *Rasābhāsa*. Thus *ŚrīRāma* stating vocally that he is a human being, his suffering from the seperation of dear ones like other human beings, finding happiness in the company of friends and relatives etc., only demonstrate his behaviour in tune with his vow. It also helps to enjoy *Rāmāyaṇa* as a *Lokacarita* sentimentally.

Same scholars argue—“In the *Rāmāyaṇa* \(with the exception of *Uttarakānḍa*\) the abode of the Lord is not referred to as *Vaikunṭha*. Instead, only the words such as *‘svarloka’*, *Brahmaloka*, are seen. ‘स्वर्लोकमागच्च सुरेन्द्रगुप्तम्’, ‘रामो राज्यमुपासित्वा ब्रह्मलोकं प्रयास्यति’. \(*Rāmāyaṇa, Bālakānḍa* canto 15-1\) Therefore, *ŚrīRāma* is not an incarnation of *Mahāvishṇu*. He belongs to the age when the whole purpose of life was the attainment of *svargaloka* or *brahmaloka”*. This is not right. Because, *Upanishads* themselves use the words *“svah”* and *“brahmaloka”* to mean *“Parabrahmasthāna’*. For example: ‘आप्नोति स्वाराज्यम्’, ‘ब्रह्मणस्सायुज्यं सलोकतां यान्ति”, ‘तस्माद्ब्रह्मणो महिमानमाप्नोति” \(*Taittirīya Upanishad Brāhmaṇa*\)

Some critics argue-

“In the *Uttarakānḍa* of *Rāmāyaṇa*, it is stated very clearly that *ŚrīRāma* is *Vaikunṭhapati*. But this part of the epic is not the composition of sage *Vālmīki*. There is no tradition of doing *pārāyaṇa* of this part of *Rāmāyaṇa*. From the view point of the style of composition also, it is inferior compared to the other cantos. It resembles the *Purāṇas”*, Our answer to this is, “The *Uttarakāṇda* too, like other cantos, has interpolations. The parts where incongruities between the earlier and later parts of the story, unnaturalness, ideological contrariety etc exist, may be termed as places of crack and interpolations. But there is no evidence to term the entire *Uttarakāṇda* as an interpolation.” “When such is the case, why is it that in tradition, the *Pārāyaṇa* of the *Uttarakānḍa* is not done widely?” The house holders generally perform the *Pārāyaṇa* for getting progeny, increase of life span and good health. “कुटुम्बवृद्धिं, धनधान्यवृद्धिं, स्त्रियश्च मुख्याः सुखमुत्तमं च”, “आयुष्यमारोग्यकरं यशस्यं सभ्रातृकं बुद्धिकरं शुभं च” \(*Pattābhisheka Kānḍa*\) And so, *Rāma’s* coronation itself is the natural *maṅgala* \(auspicious end\) in the *Rāmāyaṇa*. There also the *Phalaśṛuthi* \(that is stated\) is quite in keeping with that. Therefore it is natural that a large number of people do the *Pārāyaṇa* only upto that part. It is not improper for people who mainly desire the higher worlds to take up the *Pārāyaṇa* of *Uttarakānḍa*, which describes the ascent of *Rāma* with his retinue to *Vaikuntha*, and the attainment of *Vaishnavapada*. At this juncture, we respectfully remember the thoughtful words of *ŚrīRanga Mahāguru* who said-“The natural antyamangala for this *ārshakāvya* is accomplished in respectfully reinstating the *Ādipurusha* who incarnted, in his original place. The number seven is essential to the number of Kānḍas in *Rāmāyaṇa*, philosophically speaking. And we consider that all the seven *Kanḍas* including *Uttarakānḍa*, is the composition of *Vālmīki*.”

Even in his \(i.e. *ŚrīRāma’s*\) time all the people did not know that *ŚrīRāma* was God and an incarnation of God. Even in later times, unrefined and uncultured people do not entertain such a faith. This applies to all incarnations. In *Mahābhārata*, we come across *Śiśupāla* who refused to accept *ŚrīKṛshṇa* as an incarnation. \(अवजानन्ति मां मूढाः मानुषीं तनुमाश्रितम्\) Śrī Kṛshṇa himself says in the *gīta* “Fools disregard me as I have taken the human form” Even in the *Rāmāyaṇa*, *Brahmarshi Viśvāmitra* says-“I know well that *Rāma* is a great soul and a truthful valiant person. Brilliant *Vasishṭa* knows this. All those who are in penance know this.” We have to make note of this. Later also, people who realise he is divine, believe it. Some believe even without such a vision; and some don’t believe at all. But there is no philosophical evidence to state that *Vālmīki* who was a *tapasvi* and a great realized soul, did not himself believe it. It has no internal or external evidence either.

*ŚrīRāma’s* story appears in the *Mahābhārata* also and several places associated with him are referred to as pilgrimage centres. We have noted the places \(instances\) where it has been clearly stated that He is an incarnation of God. As these places \(spots\) match the \(references\) in both the structure of the theme and style, we honour them as genuine only and not interpolations.

Why is that in the *Amarakośa*, a relatively recent work, the name of *ŚrīRāma* has not been considered a synonym of *Vishṇu*? \(were there no people at all at that time who considered *ŚrīRāma* as an incarnation of *Mahavishṇu*?\) It is not so. Even the *Matsya*, *Kūrma* and other *avatāras* also are not considered as synonyms of *Vishṇu.* Therefore we need not isolate the incarnation of *ŚrīRāma* only, in this context. It was a time when devotion to *Lord Kṛshṇa* was at its peak and probably that was the reason why only *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* names were considered synonyms of *Vishṇu*. *“Kṛshṇa* is the ultimate principle “ईश्वरः परमः कृष्णः”. The *Matsya*, *Kūrma* and other incarnations are all his incarnations. \(“दशाकृतिकृते कृष्णाय तुभ्यं नमः”\)-such were the impressions \(in those days\). \(It is also possible that the author of *Amarakośa* was a *Bouddha* and his intention was not to consider *Rāma* as an incarnation of *Vishṇu*, but to adore him as a form of *Bodhisatva*. In *Daśaratajātaka* which is a *Bouddha* treatise, *ŚrīRāma* has been termed as *‘Rāma Pandita’* and a *Bodhisatva*.\) But no repudiation of *Rāmāvatāratva* \(The fact that *Rāma* as an incarnation\) is seen here.

Some say *“Vālmīki* might have honoured *ŚrīRāma* as God himself and the posterity also might have continued that. But the fame of *Rāmāyaṇa* suffered a wane because of considering *Rāma* as God. Those who argue on these lines should look at the following aspects.

How far should the fame of the epic spread? What is the value should one attach to it? Answers to these questions depend upon the level of the mind of its readers and the *purushārthas* they desire for. Even if by the expounding of the divinity of *ŚrīRāma* the fame and value of *Rāmāyaṇa* suffer a wane, there is no need to raise a balderdash over that. Because, truth is above fame and gains. And with a thoughtful look, we feel that readers who emotionally take *Rāma* as both a human and an incarnation and worship him, are benefitted more. Because, by this kind of *Anusandhāna* readers have been able to plunge in a bliss which is not limited just to the conception of the ideal humanness but in the *Parabrahmānanda* of *Rāma*, by worshipping him as *paramātman*. That *Ānanda* is said to be a billion times the human pleasure, incomparable, and very difficult to obtain. “यल्लाभान्नापरो लाभः यत्सुखान्नापरं सुखम्” The value of *Rāmāyaṇa* increased manifold by securing that \(bliss\). And we feel that it’s fame has spread both in the mundane world and in the spheres of divinity and spirituality.

Let us now examine the arguments that God takes no incarnations and the belief that he takes incarnations is against *Śāstras* and against reasoning. Here the term *śāstra* means the command of God, It is the command which elevates the beings who follow it “शासनात् त्राणनाच्चैव शास्त्रमित्यभिधीयते” The *śrutis* and *smṛtis* which command thus, are also *Śāstras* only.

We have quoted earlier a number of statements from scriptures which expound that God takes *avatāras* at appropriate times, out of his own *Satyasaṅkalpa*. “यो जातमस्य महतो महि ब्रवात्”. \(Those are blessed indeed who extol the *avatāras* of *Mahāvishṇu*, the *Mahātma*\) “अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते” \(Without being born, he is born in many modes\) “सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया” \(I manifest by my veiling power\) “तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम्” \(then I create myself\). These are some of God’s own sayings which we may remember here. When such is the case, how is it right to argue that the theory of incarnations of God is against the *Śāstras*,-we can ask.

And in the same way, there are scriptural statements in abundance, which proclaim clearly that God is all pervading, present within everything, birthless and never changing. Is not the opinion given above quite against them? Does it not tantamount to an offence against God to attribute *vikāras* like birth to him who is birthless and pure? Where from does the omnipresent God makes a descent or an ascent, and to where? Was his seat in *Vaikunṭha* vacant during his descent from there and till his return? Who was the incharge in his place in his absence ? Many may wonder.

Such questions and subquestions arise because of the lack of comprehension of the correct sense of the word *‘Avatāra’* stated in the *Śāstras*. Actually there is no contradiction in *śāstraic* statements occurring in both the categories, though they may appear opposed to each other. Because, spiritually speaking, God has no ascent or descent. He is complete everywhere and at all times. He does not have *karma* related births, really speaking. *Śāstras* attribute incarnation to him in the figurative sense. Whenever he manifests himself to the *Jīvas* here, by his will that \(manifestation\) is called *avatāra* in the *Śāstras*. *ŚrīmadanandaTīrta* \(*Madhvācārya*\) presents the same purport in his *Gītābhashya*. “जगृहे इति तु व्यक्तिः वसुदेवादिषु जात इव प्रतीये”

In the *Bhagavadgītā*, the word “सम्भवामि = देहवानिव भवामि, जात इव आत्ममायया”

\(Please refer to the commentaries of the *Ācāryas-Śaṅkara*, *Rāmānuja* and *Madhva* for the *ślokas* 5 and 6 of the fourth chapter of the *Bhagavadgītā*\) आत्मनो मायया, न परमार्थतो लोकवत्” Here *Śrī Śaṅkaracārya* also has bestowed the same meaning. The ambrosial words of *Śrī Raṅgamahāguru* may berespectuflly recalled here. He said—ಆದಿಮಧ್ಯ ಅನ್ತರಹಿತವಾದ ಆ ಪರಮಾತ್ಮನಿಗೆ ಜನ್ಮದಿನವೆನ್ನುವುದು ನಗುವ ಮಾತು.” \(The concept of ‘birthday of god” itself sounds funny because God has no states such as beginning, middle and end\). “When we say, “here the sun is not born, here he was seen,” the statement is only with reference to people who are located at different longitudes, and latitudes and it does not apply to the sun.” “The birth of god has originated in us and it has not happened in the real sense”.

In this way the incarnation of God is just a manifestation and not a descent in the real sense and so in no way it condradicts his completeness and all-pervasiveness. *BhagavadRāmānuja* in his *Gītābhāshya* states that incarnations of God are out of his own free will and not out of the obligations of *Karma*. He is not touched by the blemishes and faults related to birth. “अपहतपाप्मत्वादि समस्त कल्याणगुणात्मकत्वं सर्वमैशं स्वभावमजहत्. . . . . आत्मसङ्कल्पेन देवादिरूपः सम्भवामि स्वेनैव रूपेण स्वेच्छया सम्भवामीत्यर्थः” “अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते” The meaning behind the vedic words quoted earlier is also the same.

Those who oppose the theory of God’s incarnations put forth another important objection. They argue that even the stupid does not do anything without any benefit.

“प्रयोजनमनुद्दिश्य न मन्दोऽपि प्रवर्तते” When such is the case, for what purpose should He the *Jnānaprabhu*, who has all the desires fulfilled, take an incarnation?

Devotees who have faith in his incarnation say that He takes the incarnations only to protect the virtuous and vanquish the wicked, and He has no selfish motives in that. They quote the famous words of God-

परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् ।  
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ॥ 

“Is not the Lord omnipresent? Omniscient? and Omnipotent? When he can fulfill all these purposes without taking incarnations, why should he take the trouble of taking *avatāras*?-some may ask. To this, the devotees say-“Though he can fulfill them without incarnations, should he not will to fulfill them by incarnations? Doesn’t the Lord of everything have freedom with regard to the methods and modes of his acts? Has he not proclaimed that he has such a will? Has he not declared “I will create myself when *Dharma* wanes and *Adharma* raises its head? “यदा यदा हि धर्मस्यग्लानिर्भवति भारत । अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजामृहम्”-गीता अ. 4-7.\), they say.

Some have commented on the above words of the *Gītā* thus—*“ŚrīKṛshṇa* was not a God as such. He was a *Dharmātma* and wished to protect *Dharma*. And so, there is nothing wrong in his aspiring for taking incarnations from time to time to safeguard the virtuous and vanquish the wicked. It is indeed said “परोपकाराय सतां विभूतयः” \(*Satyāratha prakaśa ullāsa*-7.\)”—and thus have refuted the theory of incarnation of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*. But this argument \(commentary\) cannot be honoured, because it is contrary to *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* own words viz: \(अजोपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोपि सन्”\) \(I am birthless, immortal and the Lord of all beings\) \(Gītā 4-6\)

God takes incarnations mainly for the sake of his devotees. *Śrī Vedāntadeśika* experiences the Lord’s merciful greatness in the words, *“Anbarke Avatarikkum Māyan”* This great devotee lists ten intentions of God for taking the incarnations viz., to make his devotees experience happiness, to make them surrender at his feet, to become an inseperable kin in various ways, to help to attain *purushārthas,* to help to make the mind rid evil objects of desire, to help the mind to get fixed on him, to routout the sins, to cause enlightenment and to make the devotee totally merged in Him.

*“Inbattil irainjudalil iśaiyum petril*  
*Ihalāda palluravil, irāgam mātril,*  
*Tan patril, vinaivilakkil, taruvokkattil*  
*Tattuvatte uṇartudalil, tannai ākkil”.* 

Śrī Raṅgamahāguru used to classify the incarnations, as the ones visible only to the antardṛshṭi and the other ones which display the glories to the external word also, which are the replica of glories seen by the inner eye. He used to state that Narasimha, Varāha and others belong to the first category, and ŚrīRāma, Śrī Kṛshṇa and others, to the second category. The second type of incarnations are enjoyable even by ordinary people. It can be noted in this context that the divyamaṅgala vigraha which is enjoyed and experienced by the external sense organs, can be invoked inside also, can be meditated upon, making it an auspicious base, and can be a great aid in the accomplishment of the ultimate Purushārtha.

Some people deride saying—“It is believed that the Lord incarnates in this world whenever *adharma* waxes. According to Hindu belief, *Narasimha*, *ŚrīRāma, Śrī Kṛshṇa* and other incarnations happened in *Bhārata* only. So, from a long time *Bhāratha* is the only country where *adharma* was full to the brim and overflowing.” But we observe that such derisions can be brought to an end by giving a serious consideration to the truth that such *avatāras* might have occurred in other countries also in different times, but, it was indeed the distinction of the sages of our country who identified such *avatāras*, respected them and incorporated them harmoniously in our culture and civilization.

“How can *avatāras* more than one, can happen in the same period of time.? It is said that *ŚrīRāma* is the *avatāra* of *Vishṇu*. How can it be possible that *Paraśurāma* also, regarded as an *avatāra* of *Vishṇu*, was a contemporary of *Rāma*?”-some may ask. It should be understood that it is not something impossible as such. As *Śrīmadbhāgavata* puts it, the *avatārās* are like many canals springing from a great lake.” “यथाविदासिनः कुल्याः सरसस्स्युः सहस्रशः” \(*Śrīmadbhāgavata*, part 1-3-26.\) There is nothing absurd indeed in a number of canals emerging from a great lake and keep flowing\! This \(the incarnations\) can be compared to electricity flowing through many electric bulbs at the same time.

What is the number of these *avatāras*? What are their types? These questions are also worthy of examination here. *Avatāras* are infinite and innumerable, say the *Śāstras*. It is natural that they too are in thousands like the Lord’s countless auspicious-purposes \(wills\) and actions. “अवतारा ह्यसङ्ख्याता हरेः सत्त्वनिधेर्द्विजाः \(*Bhāgavata*, 1-3-26\) Even so, important *avatāras* of *Vishṇu* are considered to be three, ten, twenty four etc. Which are done depending on the times, circumstances and actions.

Incarnations are classified as real \(*sākshāt*\) *avatāras* and *anupraveśāvatāras* \(entering into great human souls for a limited time as incarnation\). *ŚrīRāma* and *Śrī Kṛshṇa* etc are the examples for the former type. In the latter type, God bestows his auspicious presence in some blessed persons for an intented period of time, and thereby accomplishes a supreme purpose. Those blessed persons become worthy of worship like God himself, during that period. *Sanaka* and others, *Prajāpatis*, emperor *Pṛthu* etc., belong to this category.

In some contexts, incarnations are also analyzed as *pūrṇāvatāras* and *amśavatāras*. In the former, the Lord is endowed with all the six divine virtues. In the second, only a few those *gunas* are seen. For example, we see all the six qualities namely *jnāna*, strength, wealth, valour, power and radiance in *Vāsudeva*. In *Saṅkarshaṇa*, *Pradyumna* and *Aniruddha,* only a set of two such *guṇas* are seen correspondingly. But when associated with the *mūla*, these *amśas* also become *pūrṇas*, virtually speaking.

We have previously taken note of the classification of *avatāras* viz. *avatāras* of the inner world and *avatāras* of both the inner and the outer worlds.

Of the above, to which category does *ŚrīRāma* belong? As per the categorization, he is a real *avatāra*. According to the third categorization, he is an incarnation of both the inner and the outer worlds. Some say that he can be considered as an *ardhāmśāvatāra* as per the second categorization and quote the words of *Rāmāyaṇa* “विष्णोरर्धं महाभागम्”, in support of their statement. This manifestation of “half power” is only for a specific accomplishment, and in actuality, he is \(always\) complete. If a millionaire happens to be doing of a business amounting to around Rs. 5,00,000 for some purpose, he continues to be millionaire only, isn’t it? In the same way our *Mūla Rāma* is *Pūrṇa*. Once, a person who belonged to the *Kṛshṇa* sect went to *Śrī Tulasīdās,* a great devotee of *ŚrīRāma* and bragged—“Our *Kṛshṇa* is a *Purṇravatāra* and your *Rāma* is an *Ardhāvatāra”*. *Tulasīdas* who was an ultimate in *jnānaśakti* replied, “Our Rāma is not an incarnation at all. He is *Pūrṇa Śuddha Brahmaparātpara”* \(complete, purest and the greatest *Brahma*\) and thereby taught that person a lesson, goes a story.

Some may say—*“Śrī Kṛshṇa* performed miracles like lifting the *Govardhana* hill, trampling the vicious serpent *‘Kāliṅga* etc. So we can agree that he is an incarnation. How can *ŚrīRāma* be a divine incarnation, as he displayed only the human behaviour and did not perform any superhuman act?” This is a weak objection of the laymen, who think that the feature of an incarnation is performing a miracle. Performing earthly miracles is not a great thing for the God of gods, who is a power all-in-all, and who creates, sustains and destroys the whole universe. One should understand that either showing or not showing superhuman activity in HIS divine incarnations, is subject to HIS will. We have to remember that the activities of *ŚrīKṛshṇa* were not worldly miracles but divine philosophical acts.

“If the deeds of God in the incarnations are the acts of HIS divine form, why then the term *‘avatāra’* has come to be used, at least in the formal sense to denote descending? It is only because GOD in those incarnations appears like descending to the level of humans by HIS actions and by his human activities such as eating, speaking etc., and therefore we say that HE descended. In reality he always dwells in his divine form only. One requires the vision of *jnāna* only to comprehend honestly this divine incarnation. And in the suprasensory world too, when it is felt that god has descended, it is termed as a divine incarnation of the inner world.

Thus, \(it is clear that\) God takes incarnations. We have explained that *ŚrīRāma* is an *avatara*, supported by a discussion on the objections and answers pertaining to that. And relevant lines from *Srutis* and *smṛtis* have been quoted as proof. Even arguments have been put forth. It is indeed possible to interpret the quotes from *Srutis* etc in a different way. Counter arguments can be advanced for arguments. But the experience of pure souls cannot be refuted. This is because, when the mind becomes pure as a result of *tapas, jnāna* and *samādhi*, truth can be experienced by all people of all the places at all times. Only such pure souls, after identifying \(understanding\) such truths, have the right to instruct. As a number of *jnānis* who have had such experiences have extolled the glory of *Śrī Rāma’s* incarnation, we also adore HIM as a great *avatāra* only.

Then wasn’t *ŚrīRāma* an ideal human being? He was, and there is no doubt about it. The intention of *Vālmīki* was to experience *Rāma’s* character \(life\) eminence even from that angle, and become blessed. \(It has to be noted that we don’t intend to belong to the group of people, who keep attributing divinity artificially to all the human deeds of *Rāma* and making *Rāmāyaṇa* a composition bereft of *Rasa* \(poetic sentiment\)\). Also in the point that *Śrī Rāma* is a deity known as *Upendra*, who provides help to *Indra*, there is truth. But, when one discerns in the fathoms of experience, it can be known that *ŚrīRāma*, is indeed an ocean of enlightenment and compassion, and the one who bestows the pearl of liberation.

Śrī Raṅgamahāguru declares—“The Rāma of Vālmīki is a human for the external eyes, a deity for the subtle eyes and the ultimate light for the highest vision.”

Some may ask “What was the necessity of dilating the issue and discussing whether *Rāma* was a god-incarnation or a human, when the elaboration was pertaining to the festival of *Rāmanavamī.*?” The answer is, because this theory of incarnation may arise when the elaboration of the festivals like *Nṛsimha jayanti* and *Kṛshṇa Jayanti* are taken up. This also happens to be an important question related to an essential custom occurring in the tradition of the *Ṛshis*. So, if a satisfactory answer is found hereby, we feel that it may help in the assimilation of the points in that sphere, giving no room for any doubts when the discussion pertaining to other festivals is taken up in the coming chapters.

### When should this festival be celebrated?

In this background, the day on which it has to be celebrated, the modalities, finer aspects, benefits and such other matters may be taken up for discussion. Firstly let us take up the matter regarding the day on which *Rāmanavamī* should to be celebrated.

Śrī Rañgamahāguru used to say “Spiritually speaking, *ŚrīRāma* is the Supreme God. He is a divine light that always sports in the hearts of the enlightened devotees, and a supreme being who causes the ultimate feast to the eyes. *Kausalyā* is the pure sacred nature. The time of the birth of *ŚrīRāmacandra* in her womb, i.e. the time at which the vision of that Lord is experienced in the internal world is itself the time of manifestation of Rāma and that itself is *Rāmanavamī”*. *Jnānis* have identified the occurring of that opportune moment in nature, which helps in such a vision, and also, the place for that in the human body which is the Time form of the Lord. And, customarily it is called *Rāmanavamī. Navamī* occurs both in the dark and the bright half of the lunar month. Among the two, the *Navamī* of *śuklapaksha* is very auspicious for the worship of *Rāma* \(“केवलापि सितोपोष्या नवमी शब्दसङ्ग्रहात्” निर्णयसिन्धु परि. II\) Even though the *Navamīs* of the *Śukla Paksha* of all months are auspicious for religious worship, the *navami* of *Caitraśukla* is considered the most appropriate, and that day is accepted as *Rāmanavamī*. Though every *caturdaśī* of *Kṛshṇapaksha* is a *Śivarātri*, only the *caturdaśī* of the dark half of the month of *Māgha* is considered *Śivarātri*. The day of *Śrī Rāmanavamī* should also be understood in the same manner.

Sometimes, *navamī* occurs on two successive days in the bright half of month of *Caitra* itself. Which of the two days should be considered for performing *Rāmanavamī vrata*? Sometimes *Navamī* extends upto the afternoon in one of those two days and sometimes, in the afternoon of both the days. Sometimes, the *punarvasu* star, famously known as the birth star of *ŚrīRāma* also pervades on that day. \(नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्च संस्थेषु पञ्चसु-रामायण, बाल. सर्ग 18.\)

When such different *yogas* \(junctures\) occur, when should *Rāmanavamī* be celebrated? This question occupies our minds.

*Śāstras* provide some answers to this question. But many times it becomes very difficult to think and comprehend the answer acceptable to the sages. At such times, some treatises which have discussed the matter with extracts from scriptures related to this, come to our help. But, which treatise can provide the conclusion? Is it the *Dharmasindhu*? Is it the *Nirṇaya Sindhu*? Or the *“Sindhu”* \(conclusion\) based on family custom? When such problems start mazing the mind, should one resort to *‘Anukūla Sindhu’* ? Such questions need to be answered.

Moreover, in determining the auspicious time for celebration, a feeling of rivalry arising out of mutual hostility may also play a role in this dark age. It is said that a certain disciple asked his *guru*,” *Guruji*, *Rāmanavamī* can be celebrated tomorrow, or even on the day after tomorrow, as there is scope for both in our tradition. When shall we have it in our *Maṭha* \(monastery\)? At once the *Guru* asked the desciple “When are “they” going to celebrate in that *Maṭha*? “Tomorrow Sir” Then the *Guruji* ordered—“In that case we will celebrate it the day after tomorrow.” This may be a cooked up story. But this goes to say that there is no dearth of people in the society, who give a go-by to the scriptural discussions, and think it great to do differently from what the other party does.

On such occasions, we have to take note what the *Śāstras* say. If interpolations are found in them, they have to be identified and rejected. Authoritative statements proved as chaste and traditions concluded as pure, should be drawn and rightly interpreted. These conclusions should be made only with help \(guidance\) of *Jnānis*.

At the outset, let us have a look at the statements in the *Śāstras* pertaining to the time \(of celebrating\) *Rāmanavamī*. They describe the exact day of *avatāra* of Lord *Rāma* as under:—

> ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ ।  
नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु ॥ 

> ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह ।  
प्रोद्यमाने जगन्नाथं सर्वलक्षणसंयुतम् ॥ 

> कौसल्याऽजनयद्रामं सर्वलोकनमस्कृतम् ।  
> विष्णोरर्धं महाभागं पुत्रमैक्ष्वाकुवर्धनम् ॥”  
\(वाल्मीकिरामा. बाल. सर्ग 18/8-10\) 

> चैत्रे शुक्ले नवम्यां तु जातो रामः स्वयं हरिः  
\(अगस्त्यसम्हिता. अ. 28. श्लो. 1\) 

> चैत्रे नवम्यां प्राक् पक्षे दिवा पुण्ये पुनर्वसौ ।  
उदये गुरुगौरांश्वोः स्वोच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके ॥ 

> मेषं पूषणि सम्प्राप्ते लग्ने कर्कटकाह्वये ।  
आविरासीत्सकलया कौसल्यायां परः पुमान् ॥ 

\(quoted as *Agastya vacana* in the *Nirṇaya Sindhu* Ch. II\)

“उच्छस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके सुरगुरौ. सेन्दौ नवम्यां तिथौ लग्ने कर्कटके पुनर्वसुदिने मेषं गते पूषणि” चम्पू रामा. I\)

According to these statements the following were in a phenomenal union at the time of *avatāra* of *ŚrīRāma*-The month of *Caitra*, the month of *Mesha*, the *navami* of *śuklapaksha*, star *punarvasu*, midday, the rise of Jupiter and Moon, *Karkata lagna* and the exalted position of five planets. There can be no doubt in the fact that *ŚrīRāmanavamī* should be celebrated when the time of conjunction of the above is found. But the conjunction of all these is a rarity. By and large, only a few of these normally come together on that day. In that case, what and how much importance should be given to the matter of the month, the day, the star and their *Vyāpti* \(pervasiveness\) etc? Such questions do arise and the statements of the *Śāstras* command as follows:

“If the star on the day of *navamī* is *punarvasu*, it is highly commendable. That time is more auspicious than even a crore of solar eclipses. Even a small duration of that star on that day can bestow many meritorious benefits”-says the *Agastyasamhita*.

> पुनर्वस्वर्क्षसंयुक्ता सा तिथिः सर्वकामदा ।  
> श्रीरामनवमी प्रोक्ता कोटिसूर्यग्रहाधिका ॥  
> पुनर्वस्वर्क्षसंयोगः स्वल्पोऽपि यदि विद्यते ।  
चैत्रशुक्लनवम्यां तु सा तिथिः सर्वकामदा ॥”  
\(अगस्त्य सं. अ. 28/1-3\) 

> चैत्रे मासि पुनर्वस्वोः जन्म रामस्य मङ्गलम् ।  
> तिथौ नवम्यां लग्ने च कुलीरे कमलासन ॥”\(पाद्यसंहिता XIV\) 

> ॠक्षे पुनर्वसौ कार्यं चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ ।\(वासिष्ठ सं. पटल 23\) 

> माघमासेऽथवा ब्रह्मन् राघवोत्सवमुत्तमम् ।”\(विष्वक्सेनसं. अ. 29\) 

> तथा वसन्तसमये मधुमासे द्विजोत्तम ।  
सिते पक्षे नवम्यां च तारकेऽदितिदैवते ॥ 

> प्रादुर्भूतं च मध्याह्ने मुहूर्तेऽभिजिते द्विज ।”\(विश्वामित्र सं. पु. 24\) 

> चैत्रे मासि सिते पक्षे नक्षत्रं च पुनर्वसौ ।\(विष्णुसिद्धान्त, पटल 9.\) 

If it is not possible to celebrate *Rāmanavamī* in the month of *Caitra*, it can be celebrated in *Māgha*, says one *samhita*. All scriptural statements declare that when *Navami* and the star *punarvasu* come together, it is the most auspicious time to celebrate *Rāmanavamī*.

*Agastya samhita* prescribes that the duration of *navami* till midday is a must.

सैव मध्याह्नयोगेन महापुण्यतमा भवेत् । 

When *navami* extends for two days, when should the festival be celebrated? In such a case, if *navami* happens to be extending in the noon of only the first day, the festival should be celebrated on that day only. On the other hand, if *navami* prevails in the noon on both the days, or if *navami* does not prevail on both the days at noon, then the festival should be celebrated when *navami* is touching *daśami* \(It should not be celebrated on the day when *ashṭami* is touching *navami*.\) Even if the star *punarvasu* is present on *Ashṭami*, the festival should not be celebrated.

अष्टमीविद्धा सर्क्षापि नोपोष्या  
> नवमी चाष्टमी विद्धा त्याज्या विष्णुपरायणैः  
उपोषणं नवम्यां वै दशम्यामेव पारणम्\(अगस्त्य सं. आ. 28-12\) 

> दशम्यादिषु विद्धा चेत् विद्धा त्याज्यैव वैष्णवैः\(रामार्चनचन्द्रिका\) 

“But”, says the *Nirṇayasindhu*, “the *smārtas* should observe *Rāmanavamī* even if it is touched by *Ashṭami*, if *Daśami* happens to end before sunrise itself, due to *kshaya* \(decline\). It is because, if not done so, they may miss the *Pāraṇa* \(breaking the fast\) which is a part of the *Navami* ritual, as *Ekādaśi* commences on the third day, and fasting has to be observed on account of *Ekādaśi* \(*Pariccheda* II. *Rāmanavamī Nirṇaya\)*

Thus, the answer to the question as to when *Rāmanavamī* is to be celebrated has been provided hereby, culled out from *Śāstras* and traditional texts. Having obtained the answers for the possible objections in this context and after discerning the path of the final conclusion, let us take up the elaboration of the modalities and the evaluation of celebrating the festival, later.

The sum of all the opinions of the scriptures is that *Rāmanavamī* should be celebrated on *Caitra śukla navami*. Treatises of authority say that it is highly commendable, if the conjunction of *Punarvasu* also happens on that day.

> “पुनर्वस्वर्क्षसंयुक्ता सा तिथिः सर्वकामदा”  
\(Agastya Samhita 8-28\) 

A question may arise here as to why *Rāmanavamī* should be celebrated on the particular day of conjunction of the *māsa, Paksha, tithi* \(and if possible the star also\), and why it should not be celebrated on any other day.?

We can answer this question broadly as follows:-*Rāmanavamī* is the birthday of *ŚrīRāma*. The *Itihāsas* and *Ākhyānas* say that he was born on the day when the *yoga* referred to above takes place. Therefore it is proper to celebrate the festival only on the day specified. Don’t we celebrate the birth anniversary of popular persons like *Gandhiji* and others on the specified date of the month they were born? One may say that the same method can be applied to *Śrī Rāmanavamī* as well. This may be an easy answer, but not an answer coming up as a result of incisive and serious discernment. If someone questions why *Gāndhi* was born on the 2nd of October only we can say that it is simply a coincidence. We don’t expect any other reason for that. In the case of *ŚrīRāma*, it is a different matter altogether. As we have earlier discussed, he is a divine incarnation. *Mahāvishṇu* by his will, took the incarnation in the form of *ŚrīRāma*. Acts of enlightened souls performed out of a specific will, will not be either coincidental or meaningless. And that too, the deeds emerging as a result of the will of God, who is omniscient and an embodiment of all knowledge, cannot be termed like that at all.

God chose *Daśaratha* as his dear father. “पितरं रोचयामास तदा दशरथं नृपम्” says the *Rāmāyaṇa* clearly. \(*Bālakānḍa sarga* 15-20\) But no reference is found in the authoritative texts which state that he chose the particular half year, season, month, date and star \(for his birth\). So, let us examine, whether the appropriate *dharmas* exist on the day of the conjunction of the *ayana* etc. for the birth of that *Purushottama*, whether the tranquility of nature etc. which are necessary for the experiencing both internally and externally divine manifestation of *ŚrīRāma* are available. If it can be established that such *dharmas* do exist, then it can be determined that it is the right day for the celebration of the auspicious incarnation.

It is prescribed that the celebration of *Rāmanavamī* should be in *Uttarāyaṇa. Śāstras* say that this half year happens to be the day time of the deities, the divine path of the heavenly vehicles and the way to *Brahmaloka* \(*gītā*-8-24\) What is the real meaning of this *Uttarāyaṇa*? Why it is praised so much? This, we shall discuss in detail, when the topic of *Uttarāyaṇa* is taken up.

For the present, it can be noted in short, that it is very commendable for the worship of gods, and a distinguished time to make the divine centers in us get opened up. *ŚrīRāma* is the ultimate God and God of gods. “नरो वेद यो देव चूडामणिं त्वां” \(*Śrī Śaṅkaracārya’s Rāmabhujaṅga stotram*.\) HE, who is the emperor of gods is indeed the goal of those who travel in the path of the divine vehicles. “सोऽध्वनः पारमाप्नोति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम् \(कठोपनिषत्\)” Therefore it is natural that the day of his incarnation should be in the part of the year which is dear and suitable for the gods. \(Then why is that *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* birthday is celebrated in the *Dakshiṇāyana*? This question will be taken up in the chapter of *Śrī Kṛshṇa Jayanthi*.\)

The season in which *Rāmanavamī* is celebrated is the spring season, dear to *Vasantamādhava* \(*Vishṇu*\). And the period when nature adorns itself with fresh flowers, and heralds the message of freshness to the world. And the time when nature sends a message to the devotees to shake off the sloth of the past, and to start a new phase in the *Sādhanāmārga*. And the time when a call is given i.e. “Just as flowers blossom in nature outside, let your hearts also blossom upwards and you worship *ŚrīRāma* who is also an *Ātmārāma* in the eight petalled lotus of your heart.” The external beauty of nature inspires us to enter the beautiful world inside. All these are messages for the sentimental persons.

Even from the philosophical point of view, it is the time when *Śiva* and *Śakti* come together. The dominating force of the warm *vasanta* is *Agni* or *Śiva* and the dominating force of the preceding season, the \(cold\) *Śiśira*, is *soma* or *Śakthi*. The meeting time of these two seasons causes the union of *Śiva* and *Śakti* internally and develops into an auspicious time which helps one to ascend the state of *Samādhi*. In that state indeed, the message of the manifestation of *ŚrīRāma* comes up\! And, it should be noted that the temperate climate of this season is most conducive to worship God and also to collect materials for *devatāpūja.*

And the month of *Caitra* is the time when honey is produced. It is the right time for the blissful devotee to worship the Lord who is sweet like honey, by the sweet knowledge of worship. “मननीयत्वात् मधुरतमत्वात् ब्रह्मैव मधु” \(*Mahānārāyaṇa Bhattabhāskara Bhāshya*\). The light of the *Śuklapaksha* is the time which causes development, and the *“Āpuryamānapaksha”* of the Lord of plants. It is the *Paksha* of prosperity, happiness and nourishment. And the optimum *Paksha* for the manifestation of the Lord who grants both material and spiritual happiness. \(As the significance of the *ayana*, *Ṛtu*, month and *paksha* is dealt with in detail in the discussion of the *Ugādi* festival, it is stated here only briefly.\)

The *Navami* of *śuklapaksha* is the most appropriate time for the worship of *ŚrīRāma*. From one point of view it is the meeting time of two seasons and hence a node of time. It is because the brightness of the moon will be in a state of waxing, and darkness will be in the state of waning. This indeed heralds the *Phalaśruti* \(the upcoming benefits\) of the *avatāra* of the Lord viz the increase in the divine wealth and the decrease in the demonical wealth. Though this *dharma* is present in all the *navamis* of *Śukla Paksha*, many nourishing divine advantages concur when it combines with *caitramāsa*, and so it is customary to call *Caitra śukla navami* only, as *ŚrīRāma navami*.

The reigning deity of the star *punarvasu* according to the *Purāṇas* is Goddess *Aditi*, the mother of *Indra, Upendra* and all the *devatas*. It is indeed natural for *Aditi* to wish and accomplish the prosperity of the son who manifests from her own disposition and gets nourished. To put it in philosophical terms, this time belongs to the authority of the star which provides nourishment internally and externally, to experience the manifestation of *ŚrīRāma*, who is an *avatāra* of *Upendra.*

The time of birth of *ŚrīRāma* is midday, which is a symbol his effulgence. \(Then why should *Kṛshṇa Jayanti* and *Śivapūja* be observed during night only? We shall deal with this aspect under the respective chapters.\) The science of astrology is of the opinion that the exaltedness of the five planets and the conjunction of *Bṛhaspati* with *Candra* indicate the birth of a great soul.

Thus, when we discern at the *ayana*, season, month, fortnight, *tithi*, star and the time of celebration of *Rāmanavamī,* it evident that it is not an event of mere coincidence, but one which is full of meaning and that it is a suitable gift of the *Kālapurusha* \(Lord of time\) for the auspicious incarnation of the almighty.

Some more important questions which arise out of the statements of the *Śāstras* regarding the celebration of this festival, will be taken up for discussion later.

Some of the questions raised on this subject viz. celebration of *ŚrīRāmanavamī* may sound unnecessary for the present day ordinary people. The discussion that follows, is intended to provide a satisfactory answer to those who may entertain such questions.

1. The first question relates to the month of the observance of *Rāmanavamī.* We have already stated that it is the best option to celebrate it in the month of *Caitra*. Sometimes this month of *Caitra* overlaps with *Mesha Māsa* \(the first month of the solar calendar\). Sometimes it comes separately. When the latter is the case, a question arises as to why should it be celebrated in the month of *Caitra* only and not in *Mesha*.

For this, we have already given sufficient scriptural evidence to prove that *ŚrīRāma* incarnated in the month of *Caitra* \! Further, it has been expounded that the *dharmas* which foster the observation of the festival, are abundant in *caitramāsa*. Therefore *Caitra* is the most suitable month for the celebration of this. And If one says that the problem of the month of *Mesha* does not arise at all, \(it has to be noted that\) there are references in the scriptures which state that *ŚrīRāma’s* incarnation happened in the month of *mesha*. For example, on the occasion of *ŚrīRāma’s* incarnation five planets were in the exalted position. “स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु” \(*Bala* 18\).—says the *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa*. The sun is one among the five. Therefore, this indicates that the day of *ŚrīRāmas* incarnation was in the month of *mesha*. “मेषं पूषणि सम्प्राप्ते लग्ने कर्कटकाह्वये” \(दशनिर्णय, पुट. 179\) *Agatsya samhita* very clearly refers to the month as *mesha*. So, to the question why *Śrī Rāmanavamī* should not be celebrated in the month of *Mesha* which was the month of *Rāmāvatāra*, the reply shall be that there is clearly a provision for that also.

“The reckoning of *Catiramāsa* is done as per the lunar calendar, and *Mesha* as per the solar calendar. Therefore, let people who live in regions where *cāndramāna* system is followed celebrate this festival in *Caitra*, and in *mesha* in the regions where the *sauramāna* system is observed. So this problem is easily solved, one may say. Though it is an easy answer, it cannot be decided as the correct answer. Because, though there are scriptural evidences which state that on the day of *ŚrīRāma’s avatāra*, there was a conjunction of *Caitra* and *Mesha*, there are no statements in scriptures that prescribe that *Rāmanavamī* should be celebrated in the month of *mesha*. On the other hand, there are abundant references which state that this festival should be celebrated in the month of *Caitra*. Further, *Cāndramāna* is considered best for the celebration of festivals. “व्रते चान्द्रमसं शस्तम्” There are no scriptural statements which state that *ŚrīRāmanavamī* in an exception. Therefore it is the opinion of the commentators of scriptures, that only *Caitra* māsa is considered most suitable for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī*. ***Śrī Raṅgamahāguru* also had prescribed that *Caitra* alone as the most suitable month for the special worship accompanied by meditation on the occasion of *Śrī Rāmanavamī***. The natural state of the environs also happens to be abundantly conducive for worship \(and meditation\). And so, we feel that it \(*caitra*\) is the more suitable month for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī*. Coincidentally *Mesha* could also be in conjunction at that time.

2 *Śāstras* very clearly state that like the *navami tithi*, the star *punarvasu* also was very much there at the time of the day of *Rāma*’s *avatāra*. “नक्षत्रे अदिति दैवत्ये” “दिवा पुण्ये पुनर्वसौ”. The second question is, which of the two among *tithi* and the star, should be given more importance for the celebration of *ŚrīRāma’s* birthday? There is a custom in our country to take into account the *janmanakshatra* \(the star of the day when the person was born\) for the celebration of the birthday. There is a custom of considering the *janmatithi* also. Both the *tithi* and the star are aspects that exert influence. This happens to be the causative factor for the two systems. But the *Nāradīya Smriti* says that the \(considering\) if the *nakshatra* for the celebration of birthday is more effective than taking the *tithi*. “तिथिरेकगुणा प्रोक्ता नक्षत्रं तु चतुर्गुणम्” \(दशनिर्णय, जयन्तीनिर्णयाध्याय, पुट. 25\) “ॠक्षे पुनर्वसौ कार्यम्” \(अगस्त्य सं. २८, पाद्म XIV\) “चैत्रे मासि पुनर्वस्वोः” say the *āgamas*. So it can be concluded that it is more important to consider the star. But *Śāstras* give more importance to the *tithi* in the case of *Rāmanavamī*, though primacy is there for the *nakshatrayoga*. There is no alternative to that. Among the ten *avatāras* of God, *tithi* itself is more important with the exception of *Śrī KṛshṇaJayanti* and *trivikramajayanti* for the purpose of celebrating the day of birth. “जयन्ती द्विविधा प्रोक्ता मत्स्यादि दशजन्मनाम् । तिथिप्रधानं सर्वेषां विना कृष्णत्रिविक्रमौ” \(सङ्ग्रहरचन, पुट 185 दशनिर्णय\)

Because it is clearly laid down in the *Śāstras*, we submit to conclude that the *navami tithi* is more important for the celebration of *ŚrīRāma’s* birthday.

3. While discussing the features of the *cāndrasamvatsaras*, we had mentioned under the subject matter of *Kālanirṇaya*, that during some years, an intercalary month called *malamāsa*, happens to occur. “If such a *malamāsa* occurs in any year, should *Rāmanavamī* be celebrated in that month itself or in the regular *caitra*? Or can it be taken that it can be celebrated in either of the two months?”-This is the third question. It can be answered thus:

*Rāmanavamī* is one among the *Mahāvratas*. That *Śāstras* state that *Mahāvratas* and *Mahādānas* should not be performed in the *malamāsa*,. “न कुर्यान्मलमासे तु महादानव्रतानि च”. \(*Mādhavīya Saṅgraha* p. 182\) But no *śāstra* states that *Rāmanavamī* is an exception to this rule, as in the case of *Ekādaśi*.

So, the *Śāstrasaṅgrahakāras* opine that it is in accordance with the *Śāstras* to reject the *malamāsa*, for the celebration of this festival. Tradition also supports this opinion. During the malamāsa, certain defects develop in the dhātuprakṛti which hamper the fealty of the vrata. It requires powerful efforts to ward off these defects. “Therefore when it is convenient, it is advisable to celebrate the festival only in the *Śuddhamāsa. Malamāsa* is not commendable”—ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru had stated. We feel that this conclusion is in tune with *Śastra*, logic and experience.

4. Is *Rāmanavamī* a *nitya vrata* or a *kāmyavrata*? This is the next question. *Nitya* means something which should be performed \(observed\) without fail. It is a *Karma*, the nonobservance of which may cause *pratyavāyadosha* \(dimunition\), the *Śāstras* say. *Kāmya* means an optional act. It is not unavoidable. No sin \(or blemish\) will get accrued if it is not performed. To which category does *Rāmanavamī* belong? This is an issue that needs an inquiry.

On this issue critics of *Śāstras* have two opinions. 1. *Śāstras* consider *Rāmanavamī* a very important religious festival. Everyone has to celebrate it. It amounts to a great sin if one does not observe it.

> सर्वेषामप्यं धर्मः भुक्तिमुक्त्येकसाधकः ।  
> यस्तु रामनवम्यां तु भुङ्कते मोहाद्विमूढधीः ॥ 

> कुम्भीपाकेषु घोरेषु पच्यते नात्र संशयः ।  
> अकृत्वा रामनवमीव्रतं सर्वोत्तमोत्तम् ॥  
व्रतान्यन्यानि कुरुते न तेषां फलभाग्भवेत्  
\(हेमाद्रि अगस्त्य सं. पु. 180 दशनिर्णय\) 

In the *Śāstras*, we come across such statements regarding *Kṛshṇajayantī* and *Mahāśivarātri* also. Therefore, some people state that these three *Vratas* should be observed by both *Vaśihṇavas* and *śaivas*.

2. There are some people who say “The *śastraic* statements quoted above are just *arthavādas*. It is stated so, only to praise them. All the *vratas* are *nitya* to the devotees of the respective gods, and *Kāmya* for others. *Rāmanavamī* is also one such *Vrata*.

It could be *nitya* or *Kāmya* or both. Technically any name could be given to that. But *Rāmanavamī* is a *mahāvrata*. To those who worship *ŚrīRāma* as *paradevatā*, it is not only a *vrata* with special rules but also, like *Śrī Kṛshṇa Jayanti* and *Mahāśivarātri*, it is an auspicious day that infuses inspiration to meditate, to all the seekers of divine knowledge. It is the day of the divine incarnation of the God of gods, who is an *Ātmarāma*. It is the day of harvest for the accumulation of both *yoga* and *bhoga*, the day of delight, the day of festival justified—This is our humble submission. It need not be commented upon that these are also mere words of praise. This opinion of ours is not merely based on the *Śāstras*. We have already expounded that special facilities both in the internal and external dispositions become available on the day of *Caitra Śuddha navami*. It is a preeminent day, the greatness of which has been proved by the experience of *yogis* who are \(constantly\) engaged directly in *Dhyānayoga*, and who do not merely keep ruminating the *Śāstravākyas*.

5. One *āgama samhita* states that *Rāmanavamī* celebration may be observed during *punarvasu nakshatra* of *śukla navami* in *Caitra*, or, this great festival may also be observed in the month of *māgha*. \(ॠक्षे पुनर्वसौ कार्यं चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ । माघशमासेऽथवा ब्रह्मन् राघवोत्सवमुत्तमम् ॥ विष्वक्सेन संहिता-29\)

“Then, can the two months *Caitra* and *māgha* be considered as alternatives for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī*? Are these two months equally qualified? Or is it that one of these is main and the other is secondary?”-To this question, our answer is as follows: The month of *Caitra* is the most commendable month for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī*. The distinction of *Caitra* has already been expounded earlier. In the month of *māgha* also, some aspects of conveniences provided by nature for the special worship of God are available. For example, it also occurs in *Uttarāyaṇa*. But the month of *caitra* comes is *vasantaṛtu* and it is the month of *ŚrīRāma’s* incarnation. Thus, it indeed provides special inspiration for the celebration of this festival. “If, due to some unforeseen inconveniences, it does not become possible to celebrate it in that month, then it may be celebrated in the month of *māgha*. It is a secondary provision” say some knowledgeable people. Celebrating in the month of *caitra* is the tradition which in practice by and large.

\(“नवमी चाष्टमी विद्धा त्याज्या विष्णुपरायणैः—अगस्त्यसम्हिता. “अष्टमी सर्क्षापि नोपोष्या” \(माधवीय\), “विद्धानिषेधश्रवणान्नवमी चेति वाक्यतः । वैष्णवानां विशेषात्तु तत्र विष्णुपरैरपि” \[रामार्चन चन्द्रिका\] Some *śāstravākyas* say-*“Vaiśṇavas”* should not celebrate *Rāmanavamī* if there is any touch of *ashṭami* on the *navami* of *caitra.* Even if it happens to be a *daśami*, it should be celebrated the next day only. Even if there is star *punarvasu*, *Rāmanavamī* should not be celebrated on the day where there is a touch of *ashṭami*.” Commenting on these statements, some recent texts say-“The above rule applies to *vaishṇavās* and not to *smārtas*. *Smārtas* must celebrate the festival on that day only when there is the touch of *ashṭami* \(Ex-*nirṇaya Sindhu*.*pari.*11\)

Now, one more question arises “In this commentary, the part which states that this rule does not apply to *smārtas* is disagreeable, because the meaning of the word *‘smārta’* as it is understood generally, is not found in treatises written by *maharshis*. There the word *smārta* means something related to *smṛtis* or something which comes under the rules of the *smṛtis*. In this sense, all those who follow vedic traditions are *smārthas* only. Those who are called presently by the names *‘vaishṇavas’* and *‘Śrīvaishṇavas’*, are also *smārtas*; because they consider the *smṛtis* which are not opposed to *śrutis*, as authority. “श्रौतस्मार्तनित्यकर्मानुष्ठानयोग्यतासिद्ध्यर्थम्” is the vow made by them \(before taking up any observance\). And those who are called *‘smārtas’* today worship *Vishṇu* and so they are indeed *vaishśavas* only. Therefore from the point of view of the *Śāstras*, *Vaishṇavas* and *smārtas* do not belong to different religious groups or categories. It is not acceptable to *śāstras* to classify them into different classes and ask them to observe the worship of the same deity. \(*ŚrīRāmachandra* here\). If so, who are those *Vaishṇavas* that are authorized to celebrate the festival on the day when there is no *vedha*? \(of *navami*\). And who are the rest that are authorized to celebrate the festival on the day of *vedha*?

Our answer to all these questions is as follows:

The term *vaishṇava* also means a *paramaikānti* i.e. one who prays for *moksha* only. The above problem gets solved if the sense \(of the word *vaishṇava*\) is taken to denote one who does not have interest in *dharma*, *artha* and *kāma* but worships *Mukunda*, only for achieving *moksha*. Such *Paramaikāntis* should celebrate the festival on a *tithi* free from *vedha*. The rest who pray for the other *purushārthas*, should celebrate this festival even if there is *vedha* on *navamī*. Both these groups are devotees of God and are *bhāgavatas*. They are not heretics. But *śāstras* ordain that the stipulation of the day of *pūja* observations are decided, based on different aspirations \(*purushārthabheda*\). The question of the differences in the traditions viz., *Śānkara, Rāmānujīya* and *Mādhva*, does not at all arise here.

This approach of solving the problem should not be deemed as a cleverness of exposition. The wise way is to understand the intention according to logic and experience \(i.e., first hand knowledge\)

> केवलं शास्त्रमाश्रित्य न कर्तव्यो विनिर्णयः ।  
> युक्तिहीने विचारे तु धर्महानिः प्रजायते ॥ 

When this question was posed to Śrīraṅgamahāguru who was a great soul and an incarnate of knowledge and wisdom, he gave an answer and we would like to quote the same: “The results of observing a festival on the days without vedha and on the days without vedha, will be different. The first one helps only for mukti. The second one helps one to attain moksha along with the other purushārthas. Both the days are suitable for worship.”

3. Should people observe *pāraṇa* the next morning, after fasting totally on the day of performing the *Vrata*, or can they take food \(i.e. *pāraṇa*\) after *ŚrīRāma Pūja* on the same day? *Śāstras* have convincing answers to both these questions. For example;

यस्तु रामनवम्यां तु भुङ्कते मोहाद्विमूढधीः ।  
> कुम्भीपाकेषु घोरेषु पच्यते नात्र संशयः ॥ 

> प्राप्ते श्रीरामनवमीदिने मर्त्यो विमूढ धीः ।  
> उपोषणं न कुरुते कुम्भीपाकेषु पच्यते ॥\(अगस्त्यसंहिता\) 

These statements tell us that one should necessarily fast on *Rāmanavamī* day, or else sin may accrue.

> जयन्तीनां च सर्वासां उत्सवान्ते तु पारणम् ।  
> कर्तव्यमैहिकासङ्गैः पञ्चकालपरायणैः ॥\(अनिरुद्धसंहिता\) 

>  तिथ्यन्ते वाथ भान्ते वा ह्युत्सवान्ते तु पारणम् ।  
> मुमुक्षूणामकामानां उत्सवान्ते तु पारणम्” ॥\(जयत्सेन संहिता\) 

Such *śāstravākyas* state that *pāraṇa* should be done soon after the *pūja* on the same day itself. Actually there is no difference of opinion here. Because, the *Śāstras* prescribe fasting for those who perform this festival with some desires and *pāraṇa* only after *pūja* for those who worship without any desires. The rule may change depending on the state of disposition of the devotees. This decision has to be made based on the science of the respective natures. If the devotee who is supposed to fast is weak, he may take some light *prasāda* allowed by the *Śāstras*.

We have already discussed the most suitable time for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī*. For example, we have expounded that *cāndramāna* is more commendable than *souramāna*. But in some parts of *Bhārata* there exists the practice of celebrating it according to *sauramāna*. No one should mistake that God may be displeased if the festival is celebrated at that time. If means such as devotion are in abundance, good results are obtained even if God is worshipped in times like these. It should be noted that we have discussed only about the facilities of the natural conditions and the time, which occur additionally on certain days.

Now we shall dwell on the details of modalities and rules for observing the festival.

At the outset let us take note of what the *Śāstras* and *pūjakalpas* say about the details pertaining to the *vidhis* on the observance of the festival. The *āgamagranthas* like *Agasthya samhitā*, *Vāsishṭha samhitā, Vishvaksena samhitā, Viśvāmitra samhitā, Vishṇu siddhānta*, and other *vrata pūja* treatises such as *ŚrīRāmārcana Candrika, Vratārāja, Vratārka*, and others, and traditional compilations like *Nirṇaya sindhu, Daśnirṇaya* and others throw light on this.

There is a precept of beginning *Śrī Rāmanavamī* on the *prathamā* of *caitra śukla* and performing the *maṅgala* \(concluding\) *pūja* on *navamī*. It is called *“Vasanta Navarātra Rāmanavamī Ārādhana”* Those who cannot perform *pūja* for all those days, perform *pūja* for three days i.e. on the day of *Rāmanavamī* and on the preceding and succeeding days. If this also is not possible, the custom of doing *ārādhana* only on the day of *navamī* is also in practice.

“On the first day the festival should be observed after *aṅkurārpaṇa*. After *Abhisheka*, *Puṇyāhavācana* and *Pañcopanishanmantra*, *homa* should be performed in *Agni* with *Purushasūkta* and *Mūlamantra*. The *Ācāryas* and *dīkshitas* should be respectfully offered remuneration. The next morning *maṅgalotsava* should be performed. God should be bathed in ghee and scented water. He should be decorated and should be taken in a procession accompanied by dance and music \(vocal and instrumental\) and with exclamations of victory. He should be offered the *mahāhavis* with ghee, *sūpa* and *vyañjanas*. He should be offered the royal services.” These may be taken as the modalities of worship, as per the opinions of *Āgama* works like *Vāsishṭhasahmhita*.

But, *Agastya samhita* provides in special detail, the rules of *pūja* and *pratimā dāna*. In this treatise, in a dialogue between *Sutīkshṇa* and sage *Agastya*, the *pūja* and *dāna saṅkalpa* are clearly explained. According to this book, the preparation for the *pūja* starts on the previous day itself.

On the day of *Caitraśuddha ashṭami*, the person who performs the *vrata* should subjugate his senses and clean his teeth in the early morning. He should take bath in any one of these water sources viz a river, a tank, a pond, a well or a spring. Meditating upon *Lord Rāma* in his heart, he should perform the *Sandhyāvandana* and the *agnikārya*. Then he should invite a superior *Brahmin* who is a *jitendriya*, a scholar in the *Vedas* and *Śāstras*, a staunch devotee of *ŚrīRāma*, an expert in the worship of *Rāma* with *Rāma mantras* and the one who happens to be a householder. And he should honour him with devotion.

> श्रीरामप्रतिमादानं करिष्येऽहं द्विजोत्तम ।  
> तत्राचार्यो भव प्रीतः श्रीरामोऽपि त्वमेव मे ॥  
\(अगस्त्यसंहिता अ. 26, श्लो. 25\) 

\(“O the best among Brahmins\! I am offering this idol of *ŚrīRāma* as a gift to you. With a pleasant mind you must assume the role of the *ācārya* in the this *vratha*. You are *ŚrīRāma* to me”\)-with these words, he should be prayed. Then he should be bathed \(with oil etc.\) and should be offered white clothes, sandal paste and flowers. And after that, the devotee also should take bath and wear such clothes along with sandal paste and flowers. Thereafter he should perform *mādhyāhnika.* Then he should feed the *ācārya* with *sāttvik* food and he too should take the *prasādam* after that. Till the evening, he should be engaged in meditation upon *Rāma* and should keep listening to the story of *ŚrīRāma*. In the evening, after the *Sandhyāvandanam*, he should constantly remember *ŚrīRāma*, and should sleep on the bare ground in solitude. Both should fast that night. The next day i.e. on the day of *ŚrīRāmanavamī*, both should finish bath early in the morning and perform *Sandhyāvandam* early.

Then, accompanied by scholars who are well versed in the *mantras*, a bright *dānamanṭapa* should be erected on the northern side of the house. It should be tall and should have four doors. It should be decorated tastefully with canopy, sprouts, buntings, and flags and flower garlands. On the eastern entrance of this *alaṅkāra manṭapa* there should be \(picture or images of\) *śankha*, *cakra* and *Hanuman*. The southern entrance should be decorated with *Garuḍa*, *śārṅga* bow and arrows. On the western entrance there should be *gadā, padma* and armlets, and the northern entrance should have *padma, svastika* symbol and blue lotus.

In the middle of the *manṭapa* a square shaped dias of the length and breadth of four arms measure should be constructed. One should enter the pandal accompanied by vocal and instrumental music and dance. *Puṇyahavācana* should be performed by pleasant minded *jnānis*, and remembering *ŚrīRāma* the following *saṅkalpa* should be made.

अस्यां रामनवम्यां च रामाराधनतत्परः ।  
> उपोष्याष्टसु यामेषु पूजयित्वा यथाविधि ॥ 

इमां स्वर्णमयीं रामप्रतिमां सुप्रयत्नतः ।  
> श्रीरामप्रीतये दास्ये रामभक्ताय धीमते॥ 

> प्रीतो रामो हरत्वाशु पापानि सुबहूनि मे ।  
अनेकजन्मसंसिद्धान्यभ्यस्तानि महान्ति च ॥\(अगस्त्य संहिता-39-41\) 

\(On this holy *Rāmanavamī*, I am engrossed in *ŚrīRāma Pūja*. Fasting the whole day, I keep myself engaged in the worship of *ŚrīRāma* as per the rules prescribed in the *śāstras*. At the end I am going to gift this golden idol of *ŚrīRāma* to a great soul, who is a *Rāmabhakta* and a learned man, for the love of *ŚrīRāma*. May *ŚrīRāma*, pleased by this, destroy the pile of sins I have committed again and again during my many previous births.\)

The idol proposed to be given as a gift, should weigh either one *pala* \(three ounces\), half a *pala*, a quarter *pala* or even just half of it. It should be made of gold. Those who cannot afford, can get it done in other metals, or stone or even in wood, and gift it.

> ततः स्वर्णमयीं रामप्रतिमां पलमानतः ।  
पलार्धेन तदर्धेन तदर्धार्धेन वा मुने ॥  
लोहेन निर्मितां वापि शिलया दारुणापि वा । 

The idol must have two shoulders. *Sītā Devī* should adorn the left lap. The hand must sport the *jnāna mudra*. *Devi* should be \(in the posture of\) embracing the Lord with her right arm. On the sides there should be *Bhārata* and *Śatrughna* holding the sacred umbrellas. *Śrī Rāma* also should be in the picture of holding his bow and arrows. Or the idol can also be of *Rāma* in the form of an infant looked on with tender love by *Daśaratha*, adorning the lap of mother *Kausalyā*, say some *Kalpas*\)

The idol of the Lord must be placed on a throne made of six *tolas* of silver. Then the Lord should be worshipped, after some religious observations. Then the bathing with *pañcāmṛtha* should be performed with the chanting of *ŚrīRāma mūla mantra* The *dvāra devatās*, *pīṭha devatas* and *aṅgadevatās* are also worshipped first, and then *Lord Rāma* should be worshipped with *shoḍaśopacāra pūja*. The custom of *daśāvaraṇa pūja* at this point is also in vogue. *Daśaratha* should be worshipped with the *mantra”* “नमो दशरथाय” and *Kausalyā* should be worshipped with the *mantras* “रामस्य जननी चासि रामरूपमिदं जगत् । अतस्त्वां पूजयिष्यामि लोकमातर्नमोऽस्तु ते”

Then *ŚrīRāma* should be offered *arghya* with *aśoka* flowers with the chanting of the *śloka* as under:-

दशाननवधार्थाय धर्मसंस्थापनाय च ।  
राक्षसानां विनाशाय दैत्यानां निधनाय च ॥  
परित्राणाय साधूनां जातो रामः स्वयं हरिः ।  
गृहाणार्घ्यं मया दत्तं भ्रातृभिस्सहितोऽनघ ॥ 

There is a practice of offering *pitṛ tarpaṇa* after the *pūja* at noon. \(“उपोषणं जागरणं पितृनुद्दिश्य तर्पणम् । तस्मिन् दिने प्रकर्तव्यं ब्रह्मप्राप्तिमभीप्सुभिः”-निर्णय सिन्धु अ.-II\).

*Jāgaraṇa* should be observed during the night and the story of *ŚrīRāma* should be listened to. God should be offered worship with the dance, drama and instrumental and vocal music and praises and also with *gandha, pushpa* and *akshatās*. And the devotee should be in the company of *Rāmabhaktas* only.

In this way the night should be spent in the meditation of the Lord and on the morning of *Daśami*, *homa* should be performed with *mūlamantra* after *sandhyāvandanam*, as was done on the previous day. The *Homa* should be performed after placing the holy fire in a *homa-kunḍa* shaped after a lotus, or in some other clean place, as said earlier. The *Ācārya* should be worshipped with the offering of sandal paste, *akshatā*, flowers, new clothes and diamond studded earrings and finger rings \(If diamonds are not available only gold can be used to offer *dāna* and *dakshiṇā*\). Then remembering *ŚrīRāma*, the idol should be offered to the *Ācārya* along with other gifts and remunerations, in keeping with the ability \(of the devotee\).

इमां स्वर्णमयीं रामप्रतिमां समलङ्कृताम् ।  
चित्रवस्त्रयुगच्छन्नां रामोऽहं राघवाय ते ।  
श्रीरामप्रीतये दास्ये तुष्टो भवतु राघवः\(अगस्त्यसंहिता अ II, 62-63\) 

\(“I who am immersed in *Rāma*, am making a gift of this idol of *ŚrīRāma*, made of gold, beautifully decorated by a cloth of various colours, to you who is also immersed in *ŚrīRāma*, for the love of *ŚrīRāma*. May HE be pleased”\) Afterwards *Pāraṇa* should be done along with *brāhmaṇas* and *dakshiṇā* should be offered to them, in keeping with the capacity \(of the devotee\). There should not be any ostentation, hypocrisy or stinginess in offering gifts. “वित्तशाठ्यं न कारयेत्”

In all the parts of the country, the custom of performing a special worship to the Lord in some chosen way and doing *Bhāgavatārādhana* is in vogue, though it may not be possible to perform the *pūja* of the Lord elaborately, as described above. *Rāmanavamī* is celebrated in all pomp and grandeur in *Ayodhyā* on that day. Devotees take a bath in the holy *Sarāyū* River that has been sanctified by *Rāma’s* bath and then go to the temple to have the *darshan* of *Rāma*, and offer pūja. Those who cannot afford to go to *Ayodhyā*, indeed consider the place where they stay itself as *Ayodhya*, and adore the Lord of Lords. In all temples and houses, the *Pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa*, *jāgaraṇa* during night and listening to *harikatha* etc, are carried out. *Rāmalīla* \(a drama of *Rāma’s* story\) is enacted in some places. After the *pūja*, the custom of distributing a mixture of ginger and jaggery as *prasāda* in temples, is also in practice. And the custom of inviting the devotees with the feeling that they are *Rāmā* himself and worshipping them with sandal paste, flowers and *akshatā*, and offering them *Kosambari*, *pānaka*, tender coconut water, buttermilk etc., is also there. This custom is called *“Vadāyāti”* or *“pānaka pūja”* Some people observe fast also on that day. The custom of having meals after *Pūja* is also there.

The ways in which *ŚrīRāmanavamī* is celebrated as specified by customs and *Śāstras* has been explained in a brief manner so far.

The object of celebrating this festival is attaining *purushārthas* namely *dharma*, *artha*, *kāma* and *moksha*. How do the *pūja*, the modalities of worship and things used for the *pūja* help in this accomplishment? What are the principles behind the celebration? We shall deal with these topics later.

According to the *mukhya kalpa*, the celebration of *ŚrīRāmanavamī* should begin on *caitra śukla prathamā* on the day of *Ugādi*. It is the day on which the plan for the activities that should be full of *dharma*, is drawn up for the whole year. It is indeed most appropriate that it is prescribed to begin the celebration of the worship of *ŚrīRāma*, who is the very Lord of *Dharma*, to make the devotee tread in the direction of the accomplishment of those plans and to continue the pace without any break.

*ŚrīRāma* is the very embodiment of *Dharma* “रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः” “सत्ये धर्म इवापरः’ Who else but HE can inspire one for the accomplishment of the goal i.e. the victory of *Dharma*? Some people are highly knowledgeable in *dharma*, are experts only in preaching, but they do not put them to practice. They resemble the lame who can’t walk even though they possess eye sight. Some celebrate festivals but they do not have the knowledge of the scientific background of celebrating them. Though they keep walking they are like the blind who cannot see the path. Both get fallen, unable to reach the goal. None of these people are models in the path of self realization. Only the one who comprehensively and harmoniously shelters both knowledge and practice can become a worthy guide to us. When such a person happens to be a *daivāmsha purusha*, he becomes a most capable leader, not just as the role model for everyday life, but becomes the greatest object of worship for the attainment of the greatest goal. And only *Rāma* the *Purushottama* is the person who is endowed with such an ability. As *Vālmīki* has described vividly in his eternal epic in an unforgettable manner, *ŚrīRāmacandra* was a *Dharmajna* and at the same time was also firm in its practice.

“धर्मज्ञश्च कृतज्ञश्च सत्यवाक्यो दृढव्रतः” “विद्धि मामृषिभिस्तुल्यं केवलं धर्ममास्थितम्”

		
Thus HE is the benefactor-god who bestows the fruits of practicing *dharma* viz. prosperity and deliverance, HE is *parādevathā* as well. He is the supreme divine incarnation bridging the divine and the human. We remember the nectarlike words of Śrī Raṅgamahāguru who said—“He is a human being for the gross vision, a deity for the subtle eye and the eternal effulgent light for the suprasensory vision.” And if he is worshipped in all these forms, then only it will be the first step towards the accomplishment of the plans and resolutions of Ugādi.

We have noted that if there is any practical difficulty in commencing the *Rāmanavamī* celebrations on the day of *Ugādi* it will be better to begin the celebrations of *ŚrīRāmanavamī* on the previous day itself even if it happens to be an *ashṭami*. The performance of religious worship on that day will prepare the mindset which is necessary for the performance of the main *pūja* on the following day. But one should not think that it would be good to gorge food all the three times the previous day, as fasting has to be done the next day. The *Śāstras* prescribe that, on that day \(i.e. the previous day\) only *sāttvik* food has to be consumed and that too only once. By this regulation of food, and also by the worship of god and listening to the stories \(of *Rāma*\), a suitable condition for the divine worship on the coming day, gets set up.

Now about on the details of the worship to be done on the day of *Rāmanavamī*. The *kalpas* state that a special *pūja* pandal should be erected after attending to the early morning rituals. It prescribes a variety of pictures and decorations. “Why so much of pomp and show for the worship of God? Is it not enough if he is worshipped in a clean place in a simple way?” One may ask. Yes. Those who are *dhyānasiddhas* can do so. They do not need the *manṭap* even. No external worship of any kind is necessary for them. Praising the Lord is superior to external worship. Doing *japa* is still superior. *Dhyāna* is much superior to *japa*. *Samādhi* is much superior even to *dhyāna*.

“पूजाकोटिगुणं स्तोत्रं स्तोत्रात्कोटिगुणं जपः । जपात्कोटिगुणं ध्यानं ध्यानात्कोटिगुणं लयः”॥—so says the *yoga śāstra*. All these are fine with *siddhās*. But ordinary devotees need pandals, decorations and worship. All the religious disciplines and decorations prescribed for that, help to get divine inspiration and there is no doubt in that. But a mere festoon outside and no stuff inside, will serve no purpose. What is needed most is the internal beauty. Those who can’t afford to construct the external pandal, can worship in the *mantapa* of devotion inside, and it will reach HIM. Śrī Raṅgamahāguru has said-“Whether decorated or not, the boat taken to travel reaches the shore. The only requirement is, it should be sturdy and should be driven properly.”

“When it is affordable, it is always the best alternative to do the external decorations and *pūja* that match the divine feelings inside”-say the knowledgeable persons. Because, by such a decorative arrangement both civilization and culture come together. Culture refers to the imprints inside and civilization happens to be the enchanting external form of that. While the inner pedestal and pandal and meditation happen to be the culture, the external platform, pandal and *pūja* deliberations happen to be the civilization. When both of these, i.e., the culture and civilization come together, both *jnānis* and laymen can benefit out of that. The *jnānis*, on seeing the inner images outside also \(in the form of decorations etc.\) happen to recall the experiences inside, and rejoice overflowingly. And when they design the external arrangements \(matching their inner impressions\), others also are benefited and it serves as a big help to the world. And, the ordinary devotees, even on seeing such an arrangement often, will be transported to the inner cultural abode of the almighty \(eventually, and\) during some distinct times.

Let us reflect whether the pandal erected as per the prescriptions of the *Śāstras* for the celebration of *Rāmanavamī* matches the culture of *Rāmadhyāna*. Only those who have *jnānavijnāna dṛshṭi*. \(inner vision and knowledge of the spiritual science\) can perceive it. Because, the *manṭapa* should be constructed facing north, it indicates the path of *uttarāyaṇa* towards which the great souls travel in their journey to reach the *parāmapada* along with the Lord. It also happens to be a map that indicates the northern position, where the almighty is established. Isn’t it that the spiritual texts describe the Lord as *“Vishvoththirṇasvarūpa’ ‘Parāgati’ Parākāshṭha* and *Pārāvārā*?. And it may be remembered here, that *jnānis* call the northern door of a temple as the ‘gate to the heaven.’

It will be a feast to the eyes, when the decorations of the pandal are viewed clockwise, with the pictures of the Lord’s divine weapons such as the conch, the disc etc. in the directions of the east, the south, the west, and the north respectively. Knowers of the supreme soul say that the divine weapons stand for the principles of *buddhi, manas, ahaṇkāra* and *mahattattva* and images are the symbols of our *daśendriyas* \(ten senses\)

चेतश्चक्रति चेतनासिरमतिस्तत्संवृतिर्मालिका ।  
भूतानि स्वगुणैरहङ्कृतियुगं शङ्खेन शार्ङ्गायते ॥ 

बाणाः खानि दशापि कौस्तुभमणिर्जीवः प्रधानं पुनः ।  
श्रीवत्सं कमलापते तवगदामाहुर्महान्तं बुधाः ॥ 

Lord *Hanumān*, who adores the eastern entrance is the *prāṇadeva*, and happens to be the life itself of *ŚrīRāma. Garuḍa*, who appears brilliantly in the southern entrance, is the *Vedapurusha* himself. The *śrutis* and *purāṇas* praise him with these words—“सुपर्णोसि गरुत्मन् त्रिवृत्ते शिरः” “छन्दोमयेन गरुडेन समुह्यमानः” He is a *yogapurusha* who is endowed with two even wings and is established in the state of equally balanced *Prāṇa* and *āpana*. Both these are great devotees of the Lord. There are two lotusses in the eastern entrance. One of them is the lotus of creation. The other one is the eight petalled lotus, which is the abode of the *Oṅkāra simhāsana* of *ŚrīRāma*, who is marked by a *jnānamudrā*. Thus, it can be clearly said that the design and construction of the pandal, in accordance with the reflection of the inner vision of the *yogis*, as the matching civilizational aspect of the culture of meditation.

Now, let us have a look at the *pūjāvidhi* \(modalities of worship\) of the idol of *ŚrīRāma*. The *Śāstras* state that gold is the best material for making the images of Gods. Some may comment that the Gods mentioned in the *Śāstras* are the gods of the rich and capitalists. Such people should note a point here. It is only humans who have priced gold to that extent\! It is priced so high for the reason that it is a rarely found metal which does not fade or loose its sheen. In the economical nomenclature, it has been categorized as a rich man’s possession. \(Historians say that gold was very cheap in the past in Mexico and Peru, as it was abundantly available there.\) But, it is not for this reason the *jnānis* have given importance to this metal for making images of gods. It is because it is highly invaluable, as it naturally fosters *jnāna* and *vijnāna*, which is a property bestowed in it by god himself. It is because, the very touch and sight of gold enhances the internal centers in the body related to spiritual prosperity and also material happiness. Scholars describe its quality and merit in these words:

सुवर्णं शीतलं वृष्यं बल्यं गुरुरसायनम् ।  
पवित्रं बृंहणं नेत्र्यं मेधास्मृतिमतिप्रदम् ॥ 

हृद्यमायुष्करं कान्तिवाग्विशुद्धिस्थिरत्वकृत् ।  
विषद्वयक्षयोन्मादत्रिदोषज्वरशोषजित् ॥\(भावप्रकाश-385\) 

Because of this value and merit, it has been accepted here. We need not blame the metal just because it has become unaffordable. And we need not blame the *śāstrakāras* also for this. It may be noted that *Śāstras* state that *ŚrīRāma* can be worshipped even in idols made of stone or wood. The *Śāstras* do not tag material wealth with God, who is an *Adhyātma mūrthy*. They only tell us how even material wealth can be utilized for the worship of God by those who possess it. Whatever may be the material from which the idol is made, be it an expensive or a cheap metal, stone or even wood, it acquires a worshippable status only after the *Prāṇapratisṭha.* Only thereafter it attains the state of the immortal *chinmūrtī* shedding the mortal properties of the metal, stone or wood. If the worship is performed with this feeling and if it \(i.e. the idol\) is gifted to a deserving person, it bestows prosperity on both the giver and the receiver. Eventually, a feeling of enlightenment flows from one to the other, and gold, which plays the role of the material needed for that, is indeed a priceless substance.

*Śāstras* say that even on the night of *Śrī Rāmanavamī*, one should keep awake as long as possible, for the purpose of listening to the stories of God and for meditation. In a way, this wakefulness is a kind of a sacrifice and penance itself. And, the *Śāstras* prescribe *agnipūja* and *homa* as a part of this *vrata*. This fire becomes “an emblem, an image, a representative and a recollection” of God, who is the embodiment of *jnānāgni* And the offerings made there, reach God the *yajnapurusha* directly, who is invoked thereby.

The *Gītāśāstra* says that the *karmas* viz *yajna, dāna* and *tapas* render a person most auspicious. In the *ŚrīRāma Pūja* deliberations, all the three combine. In that \(*pūja*\) both *jnānadravyas* and *dravyayajnas* are offered to God. *Sāttvika dāna* is made. Penance of the body, speech and mind is also performed. The saying *“mūru seri pūrva sukṛta”* very well applies here and by such a combination, the devotee who observes *Rāmanavamī* becomes most blessed.

Now we shall discuss the various aspects of the celebrations such as *pārāyaṇa, Kathāsankīrtana* \(singing the glories of *Rāma*\), music, *naivedya* offered to god on that day, and the special *bhāgavata pūja* etc.

As part of the *Rāmanavamī* celebrations, there is the custom of doing the *pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa* both in *Sanskrit* and regional languages. *Rāmāyaṇa* is an epic which has earned excellence as a work equal to the very *Vedas*.

इदं पवित्रं पापघ्नं पुण्यं वेदैश्च सम्मितं”\(रामायण, बाल I-98\) 

वेदः प्राचेतसादासीत् साक्षाद्रामायणात्मना”\(पारायण पीठिका\) 

*Bhagavān Vālmīki maharshi* rendered this work, only to explain the meaning of *Vedas*.

वेदोपबृंहणार्थाय तावग्राहयत प्रभुः”\(बाल, IV-6\) 

Thus, whatever the fruit that is earned by the chanting of the *Vedas*, is also earned by doing the *pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa*. The fruits of chanting the *Vedas* are, warding off the evils and the attainment of all the *Purushārthas*. The same benefits are enlisted for the *Pārāyaṇa* of *Rāmāyaṇa* also.

यः पठेद्रामचरितं सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते”  
“प्रार्थितांश्च वरान्सर्वान् प्राप्नुवन्तीह राघवात्”  
“प्राप्नोति सर्वां भुवि चार्थसिद्धिम् 

“तेषां वासस्त्रिविष्टपे”  
“संसारं स विहाय गच्छति पुमान्विष्णोः पदं शाश्वतम्” 

If these benefits are to be obtained, the person who engages himself in the *Pārāyaṇa*, should have a pure mindset endowed with *bhakti* and *śraddhā*. He should have concentration. The *Prāyaṇa* becomes powerful indeed when the reader renders it with the correct intonation, clear pronunciation and comprehension of the meaning of \(recited\) passages. At this juncture, we feel blessed to recall the pithy words of Śrīraṅgamahāguru who said “Pārāyaṇarāgi Pārāyaṇavannu Mādabeku” \(one should do the pārāyaṇa getting totally immersed in that\)

Traditionally Vedas are honoured as superhuman utterences, immortal utterances and utterances of God. “अनादिनिधना ह्येषा वागुत्सृष्टा स्वयम्भुवा” They are the greatest authority for *Dharma* and *Jnāna* “प्रमाणं परमं श्रुतिः”. Some may question—“However exalted may be the composition of *Vālmīki*, does it not tantamount to *arthavāda* if *Rāmāyaṇa* is held on par—with the *Vedas*? Is it not a statement in praise of *Rāmāyaṇa* to create interest in it?” Also, ordinarily speaking they may question that there are no vedic passages like “अग्निमीळे पुरोहितम्” “इषे त्वोर्जेत्वा” etc., in the *Rāmāyaṇa*, and so how could it be equal to the *Vedas*? But the correct sense of equating *Rāmāyaṇa* with the *Vedas* has to be taken here. The milieu \(environment\) of *Vedas* is fully seen in *Rāmāyaṇa* also. *Rāmāyaṇa* also expounds in the same way, the *paratattva* which the *Vedas* expound. Both of them have the aim in the *parañjyoti ‘Nārāyaṇa’*

वेदे रामायणे चैव पुराणे भारते तथा ।  
आदावन्ते च मध्ये च हरिस्सर्वत्र गीयते ॥”\(युद्धकाण्ड-131 सर्ग\) 

Both these preach dharma which brings prosperity and deliverance. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru had expounded as follows: “Let us imagine that a guest comes to a house in a horse carriage. The host feeds him with food. He also feeds the horse with horsegram. In the same way the Rāmāyaṇa gives happiness to the ātma \(self\) and pleasure to the indriyas. Like the Vedas, Rāmāyaṇa also bestows both bliss, prosperity and material pleasures. Because it is in a beautiful poetic style which delights both scholars and ordinary people, it attracts more people.” If Rāmāyaṇa is taken in this sense, it will be clear that equating the Rāmāyaṇa with the Vedas is not arthavāda but paramārthavāda.

While the meaning of *Rāmāyaṇa* is also studied while taking up the *Pārāyaṇa*, it should be enjoyed not just only as a spiritual treatise, but also as a story of the ways of the world, and a composition rich with poetic wealth. Both the description of the ideal life and the opposite of it should be observed; but only the ideal has to be honoured. Here some devotees may raise an objection—*“ŚrīRāma* was god himself. We have to worship him. That’s all. We are poor humans. There can be no comparison with him. Is it ever possible to follow his ideals? Even to suppose so will be an offence against God.” This is only an objection arising out of gross thinking. Because, though *ŚrīRāma* was God himself, he lived the life of a human being to enlighten people, and this should not be forgotten. To say that all his conduct and words were only a drama, and the lesson and purport arising out of them are meant for him only, and we have nothing to do with that, amounts to a statement done without a deep study of the *ādikāvya*. The great intention of that *Nararūpi Nārāyaṇa* was that all *Naras* should follow his ideals. In the *Bhagavadgīta* also, God \(*Kṛshṇa*\) preaches this purport. “मर्त्यावतारस्त्विह मर्त्यशिक्षणम्” \(It is in place to remember here the words of *Śrīmadbhāgavata* which says that the purpose of the human form incarnation of *ŚrīRāma* in the human form was to present an ideal to \(all\) the people\)

\(“यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठः तत्तदेवेतरो जनः । स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते  लोकस्तदनुवर्तते”-गीता\) Even though *ŚrīRāma* experienced the joys and pains of life, he was above them, as he was a *Sthitaprajna* because of *ādhyātmabhāva*. He is indeed the most worthy ideal person to be remembered on the day of *Ugādi*, which gets started by tasting neem and jaggery. Devotees should realize that enjoying the splendour and poetic beauty of all the facets of the gem epic, also happens to be his very worship.

The philosophy which applies to the *pārāyaṇa* of the epic also applies to the *śrāvaṇa* of the same. Because, listening like chanting, is also a mode \(form\) of devotion.

“श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम् ।  
अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम् ॥ 

It is in place to remember here, the preaching of the great devotee *Prahlāda* in *Śrīmad Bhāgavata* where he says:—एवं नव विधा भक्तिः.” But it has to be noted that those who do *pārāyaṇa* and praise \(the lord\) with songs, should have greater qualification than the listeners. They have to carry out the responsibility of enjoying the story in their ownselves first and make the audience also experience the same.

There is a custom of arranging dance and vocal and instrumental musica programmes to \(help people\) comprehend the story of *Rāma* through them. In this observance also, the above mentioned attitudes, extraordinary skill and artistry happen to be the requirements.

Now regarding various special offerings made to God on that day such as *Kosambari* made of green gram and Bengal gram, ginger jaggery mix, tender coconut and *pānaka*. In the deliberations of worship, why is it that certain special *naivedyas* for various Gods such as *garike* and *Modaka* to Lord *Gaṇeśa*, Bengalgram \(preparation\) to lord *Hayagrīva* etc. are prescribed? Some give an easy answer “Lord *Gaṇeśa* is elephant faced. So it is said that grass, rice, jaggery and *modaka* which are dear to an elephant is also dear to the God who bears that face. Likewise, Bengal gram which is liked by horses is prescribed as *naivedya* for Lord *Hayagrīva*.” But no such rules are found in the *Śāstras*, stipulating the food dear to animals as *naivedya* to Gods who bear the face of those animals. If such a rule were to exist, vegetarians can never think of offering any *naivedya* to Lord *Narasimha* who is lion faced\! Mere coincidence should not be construed as a rule. It won’t be applicable everywhere.

For example, the *śāstras* say that *brāhmī ghṛta* \(a kind of medicine prepared using ghee and the leaves of *ondelaga* plant\) is a *naivedya* dear to Lord *Hayagrīva*. But it is not a drink liked by the horses. Therefore the above said reason does not hold good in the stipulation of special *naivedyas* to various Gods stated in the *Śāstras*. The *Śāstras* say that those *dravyas* which cause a conducive state in a person for the visualization of the respective deities, and those *dravyas* which open up the active centers related to such deities are to be treated as *naivedyas* dear to such deities. Offering such a *dravya* to the deities and receiving the same with a feeling of *prasāda* will specially inspire a devotee for the worship of those deities. It will also help in meditating upon that deity and getting back to the *Jāgrat* state after meditation.

Presently, this indeed happens to be the reason for stipulating greengram, *pānaka* etc as *naivedyas* dear to Lord *ŚrīRāma*. And ordaining to receive them with a feeling of *prasāda* is for the purpose of *dhātuprasannatā* which is necessary for the worship of *Rāma* and for meditating upon him. This is not a reason presented by clever imagination. This is a fact which has been experienced by those who have sincerely undertaken the worship.

*“Bhāgavatapūja* also happens to be an important part of this celebration. It is as important as the worship of the Lord. Even more, say the *Bhaktigranthas*.

“विष्णोराराधनात्प्रोक्तं तदीयाराधनं परम्”

Since the devotees who get absorbed themselves in the worship of god become immersed in God, which is evident from the words “त्वां चिन्तयन्स्त्वन्मयतां प्रपन्नः”, they have to be worshipped with the feeling that they are *ŚrīRāma* only. They must be offered the naivedya made to the Lord. “When one ascends to the state of Samādhi while meditating upon ŚrīRāma, certain changes take place in the body. The naivedya when received, help the sādhaka to get back to the normal state from the state of Samādhi”—Śrīraṅgamahāguru had expounded.

Also, the typical combination of the above said *dravyas*, helps one \(to feel comfortable\) in the season in which *Rāmanavamī* falls. It also fosters good health of the body. *Pānaka* and *kosambari* have a cooling effect, are tasty, and delightful in the hot season. Even though these *dravyas* when consumed separately may have certain good and bad effects, become completely defect free, when taken in the above said *yoga* \(combination.\) They cause nourishment, delight and satisfaction. This can be explained as follows. The properties such as removing phlegm and bile, cooling and sweetness mixed with astringence are the merits of raw green gram. Preventing cold, haemorrhage and bile, causing lightness in the body, astingent taste and removing fever are the merits of bengalgram. When raw, it is tender, is tasty and removes *pittaśukra*

“चणकः शीतलो रूक्षः पित्तरक्तकफापहः ।  
लघुः कषायो विष्टम्भी वातलो ज्वरनाशनः ॥”  
“आर्द्रोऽतिकोमलो रुच्यः पित्तशुक्रहरो हितः ।-भावप्रकाश 

But these also have the defect of increasing constipation and rheumatism. But when mixed with cucumber in *kosambari*, that defect disappears. Rheumatism will get removed by using jaggery \(in\) *pānaka*.

“गुडो वृष्यो गुरुः स्निग्धो वातघ्नो मूत्रशोधनः”

Fasting increases bile acidity. But, the presence of the juice of *bel* fruit and lemon brings down acidity. Ginger removes phlegm and rheumatism. It causes lightness in the body and increases digestive activity.

“शुण्ठी तु कफदोषघ्ना सस्नेहा लघुदीपिनी”

But it has the problem of pungency. But when ghee is added in sufficient quantity to the ginger-jaggery \(mix\), this defect gets removed. In this way, when certain *dravyas* are taken with the specific combination as stated above, defects get removed mutually, merits increase, and the well being of the body and mind occurs.

The *naivedya prasādam* prescribed by traditions and *Śāstras* for *Śrī Rāmanavamī* is most beneficial, both from the point of view of *Yogaśāstra* and *āyurveda*. They help in the removal of bodily and mental ailments and in attaining peace, happiness and nourishment.

Then comes the matter of *pitṛ tarpaṇa* “If one offers *pitṛ tarpaṇa* on *Rāmanavamī*, prosperity follows him” says *Agastya samhita*.

उपोषणं जागरणं पितृनुद्दिश्य तर्पणम् ।  
तस्मिन् दिने तु कर्तव्यं ब्रह्मप्राप्तिमभीप्सुभिः ॥28-5॥ 

Even though this is the statement of the *śāstras*, giving *pitṛtarpaṇa* on this day is not specially in vogue. All the same, the *śāstraic* stipulation is not improper. “Is it proper to perform *pitṛ karma* during an auspicious festival?”—One may ask. Yes, after *Rāma pūja,* for the love of gods, a section of the *pitṛs* may be offered *tarpaṇa.* There is no *acchonya* in that. Is not *tarpaṇa* offered to *pitṛs* everyday, as a part of bath?

“सोमः पितृमान् यमोऽङ्गिरस्वान् अग्निकव्यवाहनादयो  
> ये पितरः तान् पितृंस्तर्पयामि” 

Is not *nāndīśrāddha* performed as a part of marriage? So, offering worship to the auspicious category of *pitṛs* in the form of *tarpaṇa*, causes increase in prosperity only.

So far, the details pertaining to the observation of *Rāmanavamī* as per *Śāstras* and traditions have been discussed. But, to those who are celebrating it in the present days and to those who discern, it is amply clear that what is celebrated is not an *utsava*, but only an absurdity of an *utsava*. Not that it can be sworn that none is celebrating the festival as per the *Śāstras*. But, by and large, it is simply a mechanical observance. Disregard to *mantra* and *tantra* is seen now-a-days. The spirit of the festival has vanished and only the “ritual” is going on. And that too, is being performed either by the force of custom or out of fear, and without any focus in the mind. Some do not worship at all. Those who do, are giving more importance to pomp. Classical music which was a sacred part of worship has been replaced by whimsical tunes and bizarre songs. Instead of effecting calmness and tranquility of mind, sickeningly tuned songs blaring out of loud speakers are piercing the ears.

In the august presence of Lord *Rāma*, vulgur songs disparaging Lord *Rāma* and songs sung by drunkards are spreading. Devotees engaged in *Pārāyaṇa* feel like fleeing when they hear them. Deities are routed and devils are being welcomed. Some people, as said in the *Vishakriminyāya* have got adjusted to that. Some may even question.—“Why should this type of music be hated so much? Don’t they also generate happiness? Is it also not a worship of God to make people happy somehow? “सन्तोषं जययेत् प्राज्ञः तदेवेश्वरपूजनम्” They have to realize that only *sāttvik* pleasure has to be produced \(and enjoyed\) during the worship of *ŚrīRāma* and not the absurdity of enjoyment from inebriation caused by the bellow of *rājasa* and *tāmasa guṇas*. Only when the mix of those impurities is removed, it becomes pure and dear to God. Today, people need an education which can make them understand the significance of the words of the *Śāstras* and the modalities of the festivals, in the light of the true meaning brought out by *jnānis*.

Nobody should raise an objection that *ŚrīRāma’s* worship is possible only by the rich as poor people cannot afford the construction of a pandal, decoration etc, described above. There can be no impediment for them to worship the almighty in the pandal of their heart, as they can be rich with the treasure of *bhakti* and *bhāva*, even though they could be poor materially speaking. Is not the inner worship the spirit \(power\) for the external worship?

People should not advance an excuse saying that it is very difficult to observe the festival now-a-days, as they do not have the necessary things for worship as ordained in the *Śāstras*, and also due to lack of time. Quality worship should be offered to God, utilizing the materials within one’s reach, and by making as much time as possible.

पत्रं पुष्पं फलं वापि रामाराधनसाधनम्’ \(अगस्त्यसंहिता. 13-38\)

Those who cannot procure even flowers or leaves can offer *pañcopacāra pūja* with the *pañca bhūtās* of their body. They can sing praises of *Rāma* and meditate upon HIM. Are not the materials in the form of the body, senses and the mind sufficient for the worshipper? But those who can afford should not be stingy. They should offer *pūja* to *ĀtmāRāma* with *antaryoga* and *bahiryoga* with the inner voice as the witness.





	 
## RathaSaptamī

*Ratha Saptamī* is one of the very important festivals observed by *Sanāthana Ārya Bhāratīyas.* It is observed on the *Saptamī* of the *śuklapaksha* of the month of *Māgha*. All the followers of *vaidika* traditions such as *Śaivas* and *Vaishṇavas* observe this festival with devotion and faith. The Sun is the adorable deity of this festival. He is an object of worship for all classes of people. In a *Bhaktidarśana* called *‘Soura’*, the sun alone is the supreme deity. He has been considered as one among the five deities in the *pūjākalpa* also called *pañcāyatana*. Not only this. The disc of the Sun is a medium of worship for both *Hari* and *Hara*, like the *Sālagrāma* and *Śivaliṅga*.

> ध्येयस्सदा सवितृमण्डलमध्यवर्ती नारायणस्सरसिजासनसन्निविष्टः ।  
> अर्कमण्डलमध्यस्थं सूर्यकोटिसमप्रभम् ।  
> ब्रह्मादिसेव्यपादाब्जं नौमि ब्रह्म रमासखम् ॥ 

*Nārāyaṇa* is meditated upon in the middle of the *Sūryamanḍala*. The name *Sūryanārāyaṇa* also is famous. The *śloka* ‘गायत्र्यर्काग्निगोचरः शम्भुः’ states that *Śiva* is the *dhyānamūrtī* in the *Sūryamanḍala.*

The *Upanishads* such as

> य एषोटऽन्तरादित्ये हिरण्मयः पुरुषः  
> स यश्चायं पुरुषे यश्चासावादित्ये । 

proclaim that *Paramātma* should be worshipped in the *Ādityamanḍala*. The *Gāyatrimantra Japa* which is done in the *Sandhyāvandana* performed three times a day, has the sun \(*Savitṛ*\) as its deity. Therefore it is natural that this festival is observed by all devotes as it is a festival of the Sun God who is both the *Upāsya devata* and *Upāsanā dvāradevata* and a dear deity for all.

### The names of this *parva*:

This is well-known as ‘*RathaSaptamī*’ and ‘*Acalā Saptamī*’ in the *śāstras*.

> सूर्यग्रहणतुल्या तु शुक्ला माघस्य सप्तमी ।  
> अचला सप्तमी दुर्गा शिवरात्रिर्महाभरः ॥ 

The name of the festival is ‘*RathaSaptamī*’ because the Sun God who is known as *‘Rathavara’* is being worshipped on this *Saptamī* which is a distinct day.

“एवंविधं रथवरं रथवजियुक्तम्” is one explanation. \(*Dharma dīpikā— Dharmasindhuvyākhyā*\)

		
“But in the next verse of that *śloka* viz “हैमं च हैम शतदीधीतिना समेतम्” the Sun is referred to separtely. Therefore the word ‘*Rathavara*’ here applies to the chariot of the Sun and not to the Sun. Therefore it is more appropriate to interpret the term ‘*RathaSaptamī*’ as the *Saptamītithi* for the worship of God, on account of the northward journey of the famous chariot of the Sun. **It is most proper to call this as ‘*RathaSaptamī*’, as it is the *Saptamī tithi* from which day the *Rathotsavas* begin in the temples during *uttarāyaṇa*. This explanation conforms to the exposition of the message of *RathaSaptamī* provided by *Śrīraṅgagurudeva***.

“The reason why this festival is called ‘*Acalā Saptamī*’ is, just as *Akshaya Tṛtīyā* gives endless benefits, this sacred *Saptamī* also gives permanent benefits” This is one explanation. Some people have explained that, as it is the *Saptamītithi* on which one has to take a bath very early in the morning in the holy water that will be still \(in rivers and ponds\), and happens to be undisturbed by any one, it is called ‘*Acalā Saptamī*’. of these two, the first explanation is more appropriate.

### The day and time of the observation

The precept is that this *parva* should be observed on the *Saptamītithi of the śuklapaksha* of the month of *Māgha*. Some matters special to this, need to be discussed. What should then be the extent of *Saptamītithi* on that day? The answer is, it should be prevailing in the early morning. Bath should be taken at that time only.

> अरुणोदयवेलायं तस्यां स्नानं महाफलम् \(विष्णुस्मृति\) 

If *Saptamītithi* prevails in the early morning, when should this *vrata* be observed? Some say that the previous day on which the *acalāSaptamī* is conjoined with the *tithi* of the previous day, is best for the observance.

> अचला सप्तमी दुर्गा शिवरात्रिर्महाभरः ।  
> द्वादशी वत्स पूजायां सुखदा प्राग्युता सदा ॥ 

If *Saptamī tithi* happens to end even before *arunodaya* because of *tithikshaya* on the following day, the above should be followed. There the *kshaya* of *Saptamītithi* should be made to enter into *shashṭhitithi*, and then the a bath should be taken at *aruṇodaya*.

As *RathaSaptamī* is considered included among the *Manvādi*, those who are supposed to perform *śrāddha* should do it in the manner appropriate to ‘*manvādi*’. Should the *śrāddha* be performed at noon, like the *śrāddha* of *amāvāsya*, or in the forenoon? The answer is, as this *śrāddha* comes in the *śuklapaksha*, the *śrāddha* and the *tarpaṇa* of this *parva* should be performed in the forenoon only. In case the *Māghamāsa* happens to be a *malamāsa*, should it be performed in that intercalary month or in the regular month? The answer is, it should be performed in both the months.

> मन्वादिकं पैतृकं च कुर्यान्मासद्वयेऽपि च । \(स्मृतिचन्द्रिका\) 

Is *Rathasaptamī vrata* is a *nitya karma* or a *kamya karma*? It is both. As the treatise *Vishṇu smṛti* mentions both the words *Nitya* and *Avaśya*, it becomes *nitya vrata* if performed without desires. \(मकरस्थे रवौ यो हि न स्नात्यभ्युदिते रवौ त्रिस्थलीसेतु\)

It becomes a *Kāmyavrata* if it is observed with a desire for health, wealth etc.

### Significance of the observance of *Rathasaptamī*

If this *vrata* is performed on the day of *Ratha Saptamī* after bath and other rituals in the right time, inexhaustible benefits will be obtained. The entire month of *Māgha* is auspicious for the early morning bath. But it should be done with faith and devotion. And it should be observed with understanding of the inner meaning of the *karma*. Only then will it become powerful.

‘यदेव विद्यया करोति तदेव वीर्यवत्तरं भवति’ No spiritual benefits are obtained by what is called ‘*Balavanta Māghasnāna*’. One who takes bath very early in the morning in the month of *Māgha*, will elevate seven generations of the family of his parents to better births in future so that spiritual advancement may be made\). “उद्धृत्य सप्त पुरुषान् पितृमातृवंश्यान् स्वर्गं प्रयात्यमरदेहधरो नरोऽसौ”

The *śāstras* if one cannot afford to take bath \(in *Ushāhkāla*\) on all the days of *Māghamāsa*, he should bathe early in the morning atleast on the days of *Saṅkrānti*, *Rathasaptamī* and *māghī* in that month.

अस्मिन् योगे त्वशक्तोऽपि स्नायादपि दिनत्रयम् \(पाद्य\)

The *śāstras* proclaim:—“The *Saptamī* of the month of *Māgha* is equal to the solar eclipse \(in bestowing benefits\). Great benefits are obtained by taking bath in the early morning on that day. If one were to take a holy bath in *Tīrtharāja Prayāga* on that day, it will be equivalent to the benefits obtained by the observances performed on the days of one crore solar eclipses. Sins committed in seven births will get redeemed. All the sins committed knowingly or unknowingly by the *Trikaraṇas* will vanish. The grief of blemishful misfortunes gets destroyed. And the person becomes spotless in a moment” etc.

“तस्यां स्नानं महाफलम्  
“प्रयागे यदि लभ्येत कोटिसूर्यग्रहैस्समा  
“सूर्यग्रहणतुल्या तु शुक्ला माघस्य सप्तमी”  
“कुर्यात् स्नानार्ध्यादानाभ्यां आयुरारोग्यसम्पदः”  
“तन्मे रोगं च शोकं च माकरी हन्तु सप्तमी”  
> एतज्जन्मकृतं पापं यच्च जन्मान्तरार्जितम्  
> मनोवाक्कायजं यच्च ज्ञाताज्ञाते च ये पुनः  
> केशवादित्यमालोक्य क्षणान्निष्कल्मषो भवेत्” 

The one who gifts a golden idol of *Sūryadeva,* placed in a chariot with horses on that day, will obtain the emperorship of the whole world.

‘एवं विधं रथवरं रथवाजियुक्तं हैमं च हेमशतदीधितिना समेतम् । दद्याच्च माघसितसप्तमिवासरे यः सोऽसङ्गचक्रगतिरेव महीं भुनक्ति ॥

### Modalities of observance

The custom of taking a holy bath early in the morning on the day of *Rathasaptamī* in *Puṇyatīrthas*, and doing *mantrajapa* and performing worship of God is there in all the traditions. It is very auspicious to have an *Avagāhanasnāna* either in a sea or in lakes such as *Pushakara,* or in great rivers like *Gaṅgā* etc. The deity to be worshipped on that day is the Sun-God or *Nārāyaṇa* or *Śiva* who stay in the middle of the disk of the sun. All the precepts of the *parva* are related to Sun-God only. The special *vidhis* related to the observance of the festival may be summed up as follows:-

The *Bhavishyapurāṇa* states that one should take a holy bath on the previous day i.e. on the *shashṭhitithi*, and follow the rule of taking food only once on that day, and observe the *vrata* of *Rathasaptamī*. “स्नात्वा षष्ठ्यामेकभुक्तं सप्तम्यां निश्चलं जलम्”

A devotee should immerse himself in the water \(of a lake etc\) before it is touched by ordinary people who have no interest in taking a holy bath. It is better to stir the water with a sugarcane staff, than doing so with bare hands. He should light a lamp with gingelly oil and wicks and place that lighted lamp in a container made of gold or silver, or dried bottle gourd, and keep seven leaves of *Arka* and Seven leaves of *jujube* tree on the head and shoulders, and meditating upon the Sun-God in the heart with an attentive mind, he should pray to *Varuṇadeva* who is another form of Sun-God.

> न केन चाल्यते यावत् तावत्स्नानं समाचरेत् । 

“इक्षुदण्डेन जलं चालयित्वा सप्तार्कपत्राणि बदरीपत्राणि च शिरसि निधाय पूर्वोत्तैः मन्त्रैः स्नात्वा”

> सौवर्णे राजते पात्रे भक्त्यालाबुमयेऽथवा  
> तैलेन वर्तिर्दातव्या महारजनरञ्जिता  
> समाहितमना भूत्वा धृत्वा शिरसि दीपकम् ।  
> भास्करं हृदये ध्यात्वा इमं मन्त्रमुदीरयेत् ॥ 

And *Varuṇadeva* should be prayed with the following *mantra*:

> नमस्ते रुद्ररूपाय रसानां पतये नमः ।  
> वरुणाय नमस्तेऽस्तु हरिवास नमोऽस्तु ते ॥ 

After praying thus, and meditating upon God, *tarpaṇa* should be offered to God in water, and lighted lamps should be let afloat in water.

Then a holy bath should be taken, chanting the *mantras* which carry the following purport:-

“Let the presiding deity of this *saptamītithi* of the *makara māsa* destroy all the sins committed by me in my \(previous\) seven lives, and the diseases and the grief of seven \(previous\) lives. Let this *saptamī* which is dear to *Saptāśva* \(*Sūrya*\) *deva* rout the sins committed by me in this life, the sins committed by me in other births, sins committed by my mind, speech and the body, and the sins committed by me knowingly or unknowingly.” Then the *darśana* of *Sūryanārāyaṇa* should be had.

> यद्यज्जन्मकृतं पापं मया सप्तसु जन्मसु ।  
> तन्मे रोगं च शोकं च माकरी हन्तु सप्तमी ।  
> यद्यज्जन्मकृतं पापं यच्च जन्मान्तरार्जितम् ।  
> मनोवाक्कायजं यच्च ज्ञाताज्ञाते च ये पुनः ।  
> इति सप्तविधं पापं स्नानान्मे सप्तसप्तिके ।  
> सप्तव्याधिसमायुक्तं हर माकरि सप्तमि”  
> एतन्मन्त्रत्रयं जप्त्वा स्नात्वा पादोदके नरः ।  
> केशवादित्यमालोक्य क्षणान्निष्कल्मषो भवेत् । 

*Arghya* should be offered to *Sūryanārāyaṇa* by *Ashtāngavidhi* using Arka leaves, leaves of *jujube* tree, *dūrva, akshatā* and sandal paste. The *Rathasaptamī* festival should also be praised.

*Arghya* should be offered to the Sun-God with these words - “O God with \(the chariot drawn by\) seven horses\! O Lord\! the light for the seven worlds\! O *Divākara\!* Please accept this *Arghya* along with *saptamī*\! Then, after *Arghya* is offered to *Sūrya*, the goddess of *RathaSaptamī* should be prayed as follows:-

“O Mother of all the worlds, O beloved of *Saptāśva* \(Sun-God\) O\! *saptamī* endowed with seven *vyāhṛtis,* O\! *Sūryamanḍala rūpini\!* Salutations to you\!

> सप्तसप्तिवहप्रीत सप्तलोकप्रदीपन ।  
> सप्तमीसहितो देव गृहाणार्ध्यं दिवाकर ॥  
> जननी सर्वलोकानां सप्तमी सप्तसप्तिके ।  
> सप्तव्याहृतिके देवि नमस्ते सूर्यमण्डले” 

Some people observe this, conforming to the below said precept:—

“The number of horses of *Sūryadeva* is seven. The number of worlds is seven; the number of islands on the earth is seven. And, taking seven leaves of *Arka*, holy bath should be taken on this \(seventh\) *saptamītithi*”.

> सप्ताश्वास्सप्तलोकाश्च सप्तद्वीपा वसुन्धरा ।  
> सप्तार्कपर्णान्यादाय सप्तम्यां स्नानमाचरेत्” 

Then the figure of a lotus with eight petals with the *karṇika* should be drawn with red *candana*. Beginning with the petal on the eastern side and proceeding clockwise, figures of the Sun God with his names viz. *Ravi, Bhānu, Vivasvanta, Bhāskara, Savitṛ, Arka, Sahasrakiraṇa* and *Sarvātmaka* should to be drawn on the petals and in the centre, pictures of Lord *Śiva* along with *Pārvatī* associated with *Praṇava* should be drawn and they should be invoked and worshipped.

The golden idol of *Sūrya* should be worshipped with the *naivedya* of *ereyappa* made of sesame flour. Sesame flour with ghee and jaggery should be placed in a copper vessel, or in an earthern vessel, if one cannot afford it. An ear ornament made of gold, or if one cannot afford it, the one made of sesame flour should be placed in that. The vessel should be covered with a red coloured cloth and should be worshipped with incense and flowers.

> चन्दनेन लिखेत्पद्मं अष्टपत्रं सकर्णिकम् ।  
> मध्ये शिवं सपत्नीकं प्रणवेन च संयुतम् ।  
> पूर्वादिदलेषु रवि भानु विवस्वद्भास्करसवित्रर्क,  
> सहस्रकिरणसर्वात्मकान् सम्पूज्य” 

“तिलपिष्टमयापूपैः हैमं सूर्यं सम्पूज्य विप्राय दद्यात्

> ताम्रपात्रे यथाशक्ति मृन्मये वाथ भक्तिमान् ।  
> स्थापयेत्तिलपिष्टं च सघृतं सगुडं तथा ॥ 

> काञ्चनंं तालकं कृत्वा अशक्तस्तिलपिष्टजम् ।  
> सञ्छाद्य रक्तवस्त्रेण पुष्पैर्धूपैरथार्चयेत् ॥ 

After worshiping in this way, the golden idol of Sun-God, the ear ornament and balls made of sesame flour mixed with ghee and jaggery, should be gifted to worthy recipients.

The ear ornament should be gifted reflecting upon the following *śloka:—* “I am gifting this ear ornament to avoid misfortunes and miseries, by the grace of *Āditya* and by the benefits of the morning.

"आदित्यस्य प्रसादेन प्रातःस्नानफलेन च ।  
> दुष्टदौर्भाग्यदुःखघ्नं मया दत्तं तु तालकम्” 

If one cannot afford to worship *Sūryanārāyaṇa* in a golden idol, his \(reflected image\) in water may be worshipped. He may be worshipped in both ways too. It is auspicious to do *japa, pārāyaṇa of Sāvitrāshṭāksharamahāmantra, SūryaGāyatri, Aruṇamantra of Yajurveda, Mahāsauramantra* of *Ṛgveda, Saurasāma* and *Ādityahṛdaya* and others, which are dear to *Sūrya*. After this worship is completed, it is also excellent to have the *darśan* of the *Sūryamanḍalotsava* of the idol of God which has been brought in a procession from a temple, or even of the *Rathotsava*. We come across the custom of distributing sesame seeds mixed with condiments on the day of *RathaSaptamī* also as in *Saṅkrānti*, for obtaining peace.

### Tradition
Tradition and dos and don‘ts. \(in the format of questions and answers\)

Question 1: - The first question arises regarding *Sūryadeva* himself, who happens to be the deity to be worshipped on that day. Why should *Sūrya* be worshipped? As the scientists know, it is just a physical object; it is a huge great globe containing very large amounts of helium gas and keeps burning by that. What is the benefit one gets by worshipping it?

Answer: - “The benefits we get from the Sun are beyond description. There can be no light for any \(living being\), without the Sun and no life force and no food. Even plants and trees plants prepare their food with the help of sunlight, isn’t it? Sunlight is necessary even for the life of a creature like an owl which hates sunlight. The sun is the ordainer of time and deeds. All these viz. our birth, life \(sustenance\) and death are dependent on the Sun. It is impossible to imagine life without the Sun—‘No Sun, no life’.

Moreover the sun is a very wonderful phenomenon. There is no other matter that is equal to or greater than him. He is a matchless matter that appears new every day without causing any boredom, even though he is born every day. “नवो नवो भवति जायमानः” Though very very ancient, he is a treasure of beauty, which is ever new. At the same time, he is a terrible treasure of lustre. What a fierce beauty is the Sun\! This is how he has captivated the poets. Our ancestors started worshipping this matter as God which is the support of life and a source of wonder. This is due to the emotional feelings. Especially the *Bhāratīyas*, the Aztec and Inca races who lived in the South American’ countries of Mexico and Peru started the worship of the Sun and continued it for these reasons. Some even say that a group of Indians which migrated to South America and settled there, developed this tradition of worshipping of the Sun.

“Indians are pioneers in attributing divinity to the things of wonder present in nature and worshipping them. For example, their custom of serpent worship. The serpent is helpful to us as it devours insects, worms and very small animals which cause nuisance to people. Also the snake is an object of fear. One may get killed by its bite\! Even then, how beautiful is this creature *Nāgappa\!* Even though it is a creature belonging to the species of worms, how capable it is\! It can crawl on the ground, swim in water and can jump in the air. Did not the \(the feelings like\) gratitude, fear and wonder regarding this \(creature\) become a reason for worshipping it in our country? So also is the matter with the Sun”. -This is the answer provided by some. But the sun need not be worshipped just for this reason. Because, even if we do not worship the Sun, benefits keep on coming to us from him. If he is just a wonderful \(object\) let us feel happy singing poems on him. But the question as to why he should be worshipped still remains. The answer to this has to be graced by *Sūryanārāyaṇa* himself who is the form of the truth that can be understood by experience, and the *Sūrya* of our intellect who is HIS incarnation in our body.

The *Sanātana Ārya Bhārata Maharshis* brought into practice the worship of *Sūrya* visualizing that, in reality, the sun is the greatest symbol, a representative and a resembler of the *paramātma Sūrya,* and a supreme medium for the worship of that *paramātma Sūrya* the supreme effulgent light. *Paramātma* is indeed matchless. There is nothing \(in the universe\) which can be compared to him. Even then, nothing else \(or none else\) has the eligibility to be an image, a representative, a sign and a symbol of HIM than that of the Sun, who resembles HIM most. Like God himself, he is a treasure of great lustre, a great dispeller of darkness and the greatest among the greatest. “महतो हमीयान्”. He is all pervading. He provides life force. He causes creation, sustenance and destruction. Though he is at a very great distance, he makes us blossom by his rays. He is Lord of a great multitude \(of astral bodies\). Like God who is perceptible in the inner sky of divine knowlege, he shines in the external sky effulgently. He shows equality to all. He is self luminous and makes others shine with his splendour. All other lights get merged in his effulgence. Though in reality he does not rise or set \(or travel\), he appears to people to be doing so. Being the controller, cause, destroyer and purifier etc of all, his resemblance to God is matchless.

*Sāligrāma, Śivaliṅga, Śrīcakra, Yantras* and idols may be the media for the worship of *paramātma*. But *Sūrya* is superior to all of them. It is because he is a sacred medium that is not manmade. It is an inexhaustible medium. An invaluable form that cannot be stolen by thieves. His effulgence, the spherical shape, and the *purusha* his soul- all these are all venerable to us. But the supreme deity who is hidden in the Sun is the aim of our meditation. The *upanishadic* statements such as —

“Worship the *Hiraṇmaya Purusha* who is the soul of *Āditya*” “य एषोऽन्तरादित्ये हिरण्यः पुरुषः”, “The *Paramapurusha* who dwells in our inner space, is also present in the Sun. They are one and the same. “स यश्चायं पुरुषे, यश्चासावादित्ये, स एकः” “*Oh Pūshan\! Ekarshi\! Yama\! Sūrya\!, Prājāpatya\!* please withdraw your rays. Let me have the *darśan* of the most auspicious form of yours.” “पूषन्नेकर्षे यम सूर्य प्राजापत्य, व्यूहरश्मीन् समूह । यत्ते रूपं कल्याणतमं तत्ते पश्यामि” etc., proclaim the *upāsana* of the *parañjyoti* which stays in the image of *Āditya.* The object of worship in all these is not the globe of burning helium. If one penetrates into it by *dhyānayoga* and notices the *tattva* which is the *paramātmaparañjyoti* in the inner *sanctum sanctorum,* then the arguments that emerge from superficial knowledge such as “Worship of the Sun is the worship of the physical Sun, Worship of wonders of nature” etc. shatter, and the light of the heart of the great sages will be revealed to us.

Question 2: - *Jnānis* say that God is one without a second. If *Sūrya* is the representative of *paramātma*, the *śāstras* should have stated that there is only one *Āditya*. Why then the *śāstras* mention that there are twelve Suns such as *Vivasvān, Bhaga, Aryamā*, etc? Are there twelve *paramāthmas?*

Answer: - In reality twelve *Ādityas* are not there. The same *Āditya* is called by different names in each of the twelve months. Similarly there are twelve names such as, *Keśava, Nārāyaṇa* etc. for the same *paramātma Sūrya*. He is worshipped as a *dvādasamūrti* in twelve places such as *lalāta*, heart and others with the sacred names such as *Keśava* etc.

Question 3: - *Purāṇas* state that there are twelve *Ādityas.* But in *Taittirīyāraṇyaka* it is declared that there are eight Suns. How can these contradictory statements be taken authoritative?

**Answer: - *Śrīgurudeva* has taught us the inner meaning of this matter. Both the statements are correct.** The first statement advocates that the sun is one as the Lord of the twelve months, which we have described before. The second statement indicates the *paramātma Sūrya* who is steady, who is self effulgent, and a witness to all; and the seven *prāṇaSūryas* who obtain the effulgence from him and who travel at his comm and. The *Vedas* also tell this clearly.

Regarding this, the *Ācāryas* say “There are seven *Sūrya*s. They are *Aroga, Bhrāja, Paṭara, Pataṅga, Vikshara, Jyotishīmān* and *Vibhāsa*. The *Praṇas,* the *Jīvas,* the *Indriyajīvas* and the *saptaprāṇas* dwelling in the seven holes in the head are the seven suns. These seven suns obtain light from the eighth sun called *Kaśyapa*.

This *Kaśyapa Sūrya* does not leave the *Mahāmeru*. The name ‘*Kaśyapa*’ is the other form of ‘*Paśyaka*’. It means “The *Paramātma* who witnesses all”. That *Kaśyapa* \(*Paśyaka*\) Sun is a witness to all. This luminous wonderful crafted universe belongs to that *KaśyapaSūrya* only. All the seven *Sūrya*s are placed in him. Those who cannot go to *Mahāmeru* which at the center of the universe, cannot see the *Kaśyapa Sūrya*.” “आरोगो भ्राजः पटरः पतङ्गः, विक्षरो ज्योतिषीमान् विभासः”

“प्राणो जीवानीन्द्रियजीवानि, सूर्या इत्याचार्याः, कश्यपोऽष्टमः स महामेरुं न जहाति, ..... न हि शेकुरिव महामेरुं गन्तुम्। कश्यपः पश्यको भवति, यत्सर्वं परिपश्यतीति सौक्ष्म्यात्” “ते अस्मै सर्वे कश्यपात् ज्योतिर्लभन्ते”

यत्ते शिल्पं कश्यप रोचनावत्, इन्द्रियावत्पुष्कलं चित्रभानु । यस्मिन् सूर्याअर्पितास्सप्त साकं, तस्मिन्राजानमधिविश्रयेममिति” ॥

Question 4: - It is alright that *Paramātma*, who is in the *Sūryamanḍala* shall be an object of worship and meditation. But why should the *Sūryamanḍala* be worshipped?

Answer: - *Sūryamanḍala* is the form of *‘Trayī’ \(veda\) vidyārūpa*. “सैषा त्रय्येव विद्या तपति” The *paratattva* which is expounded by the *trayī* and hidden in it is none other than Lord *Sūryanārāyaṇa*.

“ध्येयस्सदा सवितृमण्डलमध्यवर्ती नारायणः।”

As *Sūryamanḍala* happens to be the medium of worship of Lord *Sūryanārāyaṇa*, it is indeed adorable to us. The *parañjyoti* which is the essence of the *Vedas* and which dwells in that orb, is the main aim there. Isn’t it that the mass of the shell and the fibrous covering which carries the sweet coconut water \(*Eḷanīru*\) is also duly called *Eḷanīru* only, by those who want to relish it? In the same way, the orb, which is a divine *mandir* for the meditation of *paramātma*, whom it bears, as HE dwells in its orb, is also venerable

		
“यन्मण्डलं ज्ञानघनं त्वगम्यं”

Question 5: - What is the number of the horses of the chariot of the Sun?

Answer: The number of horses is seven and it is famous in *Itihāsa* and *purāṇas*. And so calling him “सप्ताश्व‘ सप्तसप्ति” is in vogue.

Question 6: - In reality, the Sun does not travel at all. Now, even primary school students know that due to the rotation of the earth the sun appears to rotate. This being the case, there is no point in imagining a chariot for his travel and horses for it. It can be termed only as a physical metaphor. Then which are the horses of the Sun indicated by that metaphor? What is their number? This is the purport of our question. Could it be that the seven colours that appear when Sunrays are split, are the seven horses?

Answer: - The horses that the *śāstras* state are not physical concepts. It has been already explained that the Sun is a symbol and representative of *Paramātma*. His seven horses also are *tattvas* related to *paratattva*.

Supplementary Question: - Then what are those seven *tattvas*?

Answer: - The seven *prāṇas* that are under the control of *ātman* are the seven horses of *paramātma Sūrya*. They do travel but there is no motion for the *paramātma Sūrya* by name *Kaśyapa*, who is their Lord. He is established in the *mahāmeru.* The *Praṇaśaktis* that help him are sometimes called *SaptaSūrya*s, and at other times as *Saptāśvas* by the *śāstras*.

Question: As *tatvaśāstra* puts it, ‘*Prāṇa*’ is only one force. That itself is called *Jyeshṭhaprāna* or *Mukhyaprāṇa*, isn‘t it?

Answer: - It is true that *Jyeshṭha* or *Śreshṭha Prāṇa* is one and only one. But spiritual science states that their modes or course of actions are divided into two, five, seven or ten, and they are called *pañcaprāna, sapta prāṇa* and *daśaprāna*. This way it may be said that *prāṇa* is only one, or as seven as per the divisions of its modes. This *tattva* itself is stated in the *vedas* as—“The chariot of the Sun is drawn by only one horse and it has seven names. “एको अश्वो वहति सप्तनामा”

Question 6: - By the above explanation one may define the Sun as a *Devatā*. But how does the *parva* ‘*Rathasaptamī*’ becomes a *devatā*?

Answer: - *Rathasaptamī parva* is a limb of time. The presiding deity of that component of time is called ‘*Rathasaptamī Devatā*’. This *Rathasaptamī* is the mother of the three worlds. *Arghya* should be offered to *Sūryanārāyaṇa* accompanied by her.

“जननी सर्वलोकानां सप्तमी रथसप्तमी” “सप्तमीसहितो देव गृहाणार्घ्यं नमो स्तु ते”

This scriptural prayer has been noted earlier.

Question 7: - Why should the leaves of *arka* be used in the holy bath as part of the *vrata*?

Answer: - It should be noted that *arka* is a plant dear to *Sūrya*. Words such as ‘*Ekka*’, ‘*Erkam*’, ‘*Ākh*’ are only aberrations of the word *Arka* which denote the Sun.

		
Question 8: - *Arka \(Sūrya\)* and *arka patra* may sound similar. But what is the relationship between the Sun-God and the leaf of that *arka*?

*Āyurveda* says that the leaf of *arka* is bitter, heat producing, cures *vata, śopha*, wounds, leprosy, and an antiseptic, and removes the disorders of phlegm and the stomach. But why should Sun god be correlated with the above said *arka* leaf which possesses many curative properties?

Answer -: We are not correlating. We should only understand the relation that is a natural connection. The touch of *arkapatra* helps to dry up the *Rasa* which impedes *Brahmacarya,* and facilitates the blossoming of the inner spiritual centers in the body, by the Sun God. Therefore it is said to be dear to *Sūryanārāyaṇa*. Because *arkapatra* is sacred like this, *sāmagas* invoke *Ṛshis* on the *arka patra* during *upākarma*.

Question 9: - Why should jujube leaves be used during the holy bath as part of the *vrata*?

Answer: - According to *Āyurveda*, the leaf of jujube also has properties such as eradicating of skin diseases, thirst associated with fever, etc It possesses qualities by which the *ādhidaivika* and *ādhyatmika* torments are warded off.

Question 10: - Why should the *arkapatra* and *badaripatra* be used on that day in sevens only?

Answer: We have already mentioned that the number seven is a mystic number related to the Sun. The *tithi* is seventh, \(*saptamī*\), the number of leaves offered is seven, the number of circumambulations is seven, the number of *naivedyas* is seven and the number of horses of the Sun is also seven.

Question 11: - Why should the *Rathotsavas* be begun on that day?

Answer: - This question has been partially answered already in the write-up on *Uttarāyaṇapuṇyakāla*. Generally all of us are travelling in either *Dakshiṇāyana* or *Pitṛyāna*, ie in the path of worldly life. It is auspicious to travel in the *uttarāyaṇa* or *Nivṛttimārga \(devayāna\)* As the distinct time which facilitates it becomes available during the entire *uttarāyaṇa*, and to a greater extent during the \(*uttrāyaṇa puṇya kāla*\) and the *Rathasaptamī parva*, which falls in the beginning of *uttarāyaṇa*, we are supposed to draw the *uttarāyaṇa* \(*Brahmamārga*\) chariot. The *parva kāla* of *Rathasaptamī* being the bright fortnight and the day \(time\) are related to the *Devayāna* path. Everyone draws the chariots of their own ambitions. But fortunate persons should \(draw\) the chariot of the wish of God with their self happiness and cooperation. For this reason, the festival of chariots of temples usually begin on the day of *Rathasaptamī*. It is not a *Rathotsava* of the life of a worldly person. It is the *Rathotsava* of the wish of *paramātma* which is the spirit of spirits \(“नित्यो नित्यानां चेतनश्चेतनानां”\) The fortunate ones who participate in that will find the supreme shore of *Brahmamārga*. “सोऽध्वनः पारमाप्नोति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्” But the pulling of that chariot should not be just a mechanical or a technical or a technological act. It should be an act filled with *tattva, Bhāva* and *Bhakti* and should be an act which provides *Samskāra*.

Question 12: - What is purpose of distributing sesame on that day?

Answer: - This has been already explained in the discussion of *MakaraSaṅkrānti parva*. Here we briefly state that sesame is a material which wards off troubles and causes peace and prosperity.

Question 13: - Why should the water, which is used for the holy bath on *Rathasaptamī*, be stirred with the staff of a sugar cane? Why is it laid down that holy water should be stirred before it is touched by others.

Answer: - This holy water is a representative of the form of *Rasa* of the *paramātman* who is cool like ambrosia. The scriptural statement “एष ब्रह्म, प्रविष्टोऽस्मि ग्रीष्मे शीतमिव ह्रदम्” \(“I shall immerse myself in *paramātman*, just as I take a dip in a cool lake” during summer\) is based on this truth. It is the most ancient thing which is only one and without a second \(*Ekamevādvitīya*\), and the one which is not subject to any *vikāra* “सदेव सोम्येदमग्र आसीत्”, as proclaimed by the *Vedas*. “That should be stirred first with the sugarcane staff in the form of our mind” is the *samskāra* that is intended in that act of stirring with the sugarcane staff.

***Śrī gurudeva* had enlightened us the principle behind this as follows:**

**“The sugar cane staff endowed with nodes represents the *parva*s of life. It represents our spinal column which has many vertebrae”**. A yogi immerses himself in every *parva* of the staff of life, and in every place of the *tattva* in the spinal column. Meaningful emulation of that is done by others together with *Yogi*.

Question 14: - What is the purpose of placing a vessel with a lighted lamp on the head at the time of *puṇyasnāna* of *Rathasaptamī* and offering it in the holy waters where the bath is taken?

		
Answer: - A lighted lamp is a representative of *paramātma*n the *Parañjyoti*. It is an auspicious *dravya*. It is also a very great *dravya* for worship. It is highly apporpirate to light the lamp and place it in the *sahasrārasthāna* of the head, for the worship of *Sūryanārāyaṇa* who is another representative of *paramātma*n, the *Parañjyoti*, a mass of effulgence, a form of auspiciousness and the one who is very highly adorable. The head is the original place of the tree of body. It is the place of confluence of all forces. It is the place of *Nārāyaṇa* and the place of *SadāŚiva*. There is no doubt that it is very greatly proper to place that superior worship material \(lighted lamp\) on that best part of the body \(ie the head\) which is also the best place for worship.

Subordinate question: Why should the lamp which is related to *Sūryadeva* be offered in water?

Answer: - One has to immerse himself in *Brahma* in the form of holy water. The image of *Sūryadeva* has also appeared in it. It is proper the lighted lamp with which *Sūryadeva* was worshipped, is let afloat in water, as it is the form of *Rasa* of *Varuṇadevatā*, who is an other form of *Sūrya*.

Question 16: - Why should the wick used in the worship of *Sūrya* be smeared with safflower juice?

The color of *Kusumbha* \(or *Mahārajana*\) juice is dear to the deity *Sūrya*. *Sūryadeva* shines bright like the red hibiscus. “जपाकुसुमसङ्काशं काश्यपेयं महाद्युतिम्”. Among *Candanas*, the red *candana* is dear to him. It should be noted that the color of the cloth covering the materials for his worship viz. sesame, flour mixed with jaggery, golden idol, the ear ornament and others should also be red.

Question 17: - Why the *Sūryamanḍalotsava* is carried out in a special way on *Ratha Saptamī*?

Answer: - As the Sun is the presiding deity for the festival on that day, it is also the day of festival of worship of Sun-God. As the Lord who is worshipped by *yogis* is inside the orb of the Sun, it is very greatly auspicious to have the *darśan* of the *utsava* of the idol of God who adorns the centre of the circle of effulgence of the sun, immediately after the morning bath and at the time of sunrise.

> ध्येयस्सदा सवितृमण्डलमध्यवर्ती,  
> नारायणस्सरसिजासनसन्निविष्टः ।  
> अर्कमण्डलमध्यस्थं सूर्यकोटिसमप्रभम् ।  
> ब्रह्मादिसेव्यपादाब्जम् नौमि ब्रह्म रमासखम् ॥ 

The \(Sun\) is the form of *paramātma*, is the dwelling place of *paramātma* and is the *Mahādvāra* of *yoga*. *Yogis* travel to the city of *parabrahma* penetrating the orb of the Sun.

> द्वामिमौ पुरुषौ लोके सूर्यमण्डलभेदिनौ ।  
> परिव्रड् योगयुक्तश्च रणे चाभिमुखो हतः ॥ 

In this way, the festival is specially celebrated by placing the idol of God in the middle of the orb of the idol of *Sūrya*, which is related to the nature and character of *ParamātmaSūrya* in various ways.

It should be noted that during *Sūryapūja* also which is performed at the time of taking bath, and also while worshipping the *Amśas* of *Sūryadeva*, *Śiva* accompanied by *Devi* is worshipped, which is evident from the words

“गायत्र्यर्काग्निगोचरः शम्भुः” \(*Shambhu* is visualized in *Gāyatri, Sūrya* and *Agni*\)





	 
## Subbarāyana Shashṭhī

*Subbarāyana Shashṭhī* is an important *Vrata* observed in the month of *Mārgaśira*. Though its scriptural name is *‘Skandashashṭhī’*, since the Lord is famously known by names such as *‘Skanda’*, *‘Shaṇmukha’*, *‘Kumāra’* etc, is called *‘Subrahmaṇyeśvara’* in tradition, the *vrata parva* of *Shashṭhī tithi* \(related to his special\) worship is called *‘Subbarāyana Shashṭhī’* in custom, where the word *Subbarāyana* is the kannada version of the Sanskrit word of *Subrahmaṇya Rāja.*

### 1. When should this *Vrata* be observed?

This *Vrata* should observed on the *Shashṭhī* of the month of *Mārgaśira* in the *śuklapaksha*. If this *Shashṭhī* happens to be touched by the *Pañcamī* of the previous day, it is much superior.

> कृष्णाष्टमी स्कन्दषष्ठी शिवरात्रिश्चतुर्दशी ।  
> एताः पूर्वयुताः कार्याः तिथ्यन्ते पारणं भवेत् ॥ 

As per the above said words of *Bhṛgu*, the *vedha* of the previous day is very auspicious for this. It is still special if it falls on a Sunday conjoined with the *yoga* called *‘vaidhṛti’*. \(*Vaidhṛti* is a special *yoga* identified in the *Pañcānga*.\) Then this *vrata* will be called *‘campāshashṭhī’*. But, sometimes, the *campāshashṭhī* may happen to have the *vedha* of either *Pañcamī* or *Saptamī*. “If the likelyhood of doing *Pāraṇa* in the middle of the first *yāma* of the night of the next day is not there, then there should be the *vedha* of *Pañcamī tithi*. Otherwise the day with the *vedha* of *Saptamī* itself is auspicious” says *Divodāsa*. *Pāraṇa* should be done as a part of the *Vrata*, when the *tithi* ends. This *vrata* is famous in *Maharashtra* by the name *‘campa Shashṭhī’*. In the remaining parts of the country, it is popularly known as *‘SkandaShashṭhī’* \(or *‘Subbarāyana Shashṭhī’*\).

The *Pañcamī* which precedes this *Subbarāyana Shashṭhī* is also a day of worship of serpents. So also, the *Pañcamī* of *Śrāvaṇa śukla paksha* is called *‘NāgaraPañcamī’* and is also called *‘GaruḍaPañcamī’*, and *Nāgadevata* is worshipped on that day. The *Shashṭhī* of the following day is renowned as ’*Siriyāḷa Shashṭhī’*. Even the *Pañcamī* and *Shashṭhī tithis* of the bright fortnights of the months *pushya* and *māgha* are auspicious for the worship of *Nāgadevatas* and *Kumārasvāmi*. It is said that all the *shashṭhī tithis* of the bright fortnight of every month are auspicious for the worship of *Kumārasvāmi*. But among these, the most famous is the *Subbarāyana Shashṭhī* of the *Mārgaśira* month. The *Nāgapūja* of the previous day is also famous. In all the famous pilgrimage centers of *Kumārasvāmi*, special worship of *Kumāradevatā* and *Rathotsavas* are held on the *Shashṭhī tithi* of the bright fortnight of the months of *Mārgaśira, pushya* and *māgha*.

*Pañcamī* is the day when Lord *Skanda* married *Devasenā* and obtained *Śrīyoga*. *Shashṭhī* is the day on which he accomplished the task of killing *Tārakāsura*. Therefore, both these are great days which are dear to *Skanda*, says the *Mahābhārata*.

> श्रीजुष्टः पामीं स्कन्दस्तस्माच्छ्रीपामी स्मृता ।  
> षष्ठ्यां कृतार्थोभूद्यस्मात्तस्मात् षष्ठी महातिथिः ॥ \(वनपर्व 229\) 

### 2. Who should observe this *parva?*

All those who are desirous of obtaining the exceptional grace of this great deity, who is called by names such as *Skanda, Shaṇmukha, Kumāra, Kārtikeya*, and *Subrahmaṇya*, may observe this festival. *Skanda* is the supreme deity who can grant all the four fold values of life. And also, this *Kumāra Kārtikeya* specially blesses \(devotees\) with *Brahma jnāna*, longevity of life, Good health, relief from great diseases like fits, leprosy etc., relief from the torments of *Bhūtas*, good fortune of progeny, prosperity, contentment, fame, victory against enemies and for *Skandāsalokya*.

> स पुष्टितुष्टी सम्प्राप्य स्कन्दसालोक्यमाप्नुयात् \(वनपर्व 232-21\)  
> सर्वपापविनिर्मुक्तो याति ब्रह्म सनातनम्  
> आयुष्मान् पुत्रपौत्रैश्च स्कन्दसालोक्यमाप्नुयात्  
\(वाल्मीकिरामायण,11, बाल, 37-34\) 

> अपस्मारकुष्ठक्षयार्शः प्रमेहज्वरोन्मादगुल्मादिरोगा महान्तः ।  
> पिशाचाश्च सर्वे भवत्पत्रभूतिं विलोक्य क्षणात्तारकारे द्रवन्ते ॥  
\(श्रीशङ्कराचार्य-सुब्रह्मण्य भुजङ्ग - 15\) 

Those for whom *Kumārasvāmi Subrahmaṇya* is the family deity or *Ishṭadevatā*, celebrate this festival in a special way. The divine *darśanas* related to *Bhaktiyoga* are six in number. *Skāndabhaktidarśana* is also one of them. This day happens to be the greatest *Parvadina* for those devotees who follow that, and there can be no doubt about it at all.

> शैवं च वैष्णवं शाक्तं सौरं गाणापतं तथा ।  
> स्कान्दं च भकिमार्गस्य दर्शनानि षडेव हि ॥ 

### 3. How should this *parva* be observed?

As we have noted earlier, the tradition of worshipping *Subrahmaṇya* on both days i.e. on *SubrahmaṇyaShashṭhī* and the previous day is in vogue. He is worshipped in the form of *Nāga* also. He is also worshipped in the forms of *devatās* such as *brahmacāri Bāla Subrahmaṇya* and as a divine householder having six faces along with *Devī* and endowed with many weapons, such as *śakti, vajra, Aṅkuśa* etc. A treatise called *‘Śaivāgamaśekhara* depicts the seventeen types of the forms of the Lord as *jnānaśakti, Skanda, Agnijāta, Saurabheya, Gāṅgeya, Śaravaṇodbhava, Kārtikeya, Kumāra, Shaṇmukha, Tārakāri, Senāni, Guha, Brahmacārī, Deśika, Krauncabhedana, Śikhivāhana,* and *Velāyudha*. \(It is said that *Śrī Śankarabhagavatpāda* revived the six *darśanas* viz - *śaiva, Vaishṇava, śākta, Saura, Gāṇāpatya* and *skānda* as *Vaidikabhakti darśanas*.\)

Devotees worship *Subrahmaṇya* in the form of *Nāgadevatā* on the day of *Pañcamī* or *Shashṭhī* or on both the days. Lord *Subrahmaṇya* is invoked in anthills where snakes live, or in images in the form of a serpent located on the platform built around peepal trees, and is given a holy bath with milk, and *pāyasa* is offered as *naivedya*. On that day food is taken either only once or fast is observed.

This *Kshīrābhisheka* is called *“Tanī ereyuvudu”* in the Kannada country. On the day of *Shashṭhī parva, Kumārasvāmi* is worshipped at homes in the image of a serpent with *Abhisheka* etc. On the day of performing *Tanī* to the *Nāgadevata*, cooked items, fried items and items with salt content are not offered as *naivedya*. They are neither taken as *prasāda* also. Serpents do not tolerate the touch of the heat of fire. They are pleased with only cool and sweet dishes as *naivedya.*

A treatise by *Divodāsa* says—*“Kumārasvāmi* should be worshipped on both *Pañcamī* and *Shashṭhī* by observing austerities such as *bramhacarya* etc. Devotees who take up the worship of this God, are expected to follow a high level of *maḍi*. The Lord does not tolerate even the touch of any kind of impurity. On *Shashṭhī* Lord *Kumārasvāmi* should be invoked in an idol of silver with the following prayer.

“सेनाविदारक स्कन्द महासेन महाबल । रुद्रोमाग्निज षड्वक्त्र गङ्गागर्भ नमोऽस्तु ते ॥” and, after *pūjā* is performed, it should be given as *dāna* to a deserving person.”

Just as the number ‘twenty one’ has a special significance in the *Gaṇeśa pūjākalpa*, the number ‘six’ is of special significance in the *pūjākalpa* of *Shaṇmukhasvāmī*. The day of his worship is the *Shashṭhī tithi*. He has six faces and six *śaktis*. The most important power among them is called *‘Shashṭhī’* only. The musical sound that is dear to him is named *‘Shashṭhīnāda’*. The *raga* is called *‘Shaṇmukhapriya’*. The number of materials used for his worship - viz, leaves, flowers, and a steamed sweet \(*kadubu*\) cooked without oil numbering six, are to be offered as *naivedya*.

After worship, six *brahmacāris*\(or at least one, if six *brahmacāris* are not available\) should be worshipped with the supposition that they are *‘Bāla Subrahmaṇyasvāmi’* and should be made happy with food, offering of clothes and *Dakshiṇa*. After that *Brahmacāripūjā*, the *pūjāvratis* should fast on that day and should do *pāraṇa* after the *Shashṭhī tithi* ends. Or, should take the *prasāda* that day itself as *Ekabhukta*.

Though there are differences in the modalities of worship of *Kumāra*, the abovesaid description is generally found in all the *pūjakalpas*.

In order to make some important matters related to this *parva* of *Subbarāya* to be easily understood, we present hereby some questions and answers.

Question 1:- The worship of *Kumārasvāmi* is seen only in South India. Tamils call him *“Tamilar Kaḍavuḷ”* \(God of Tamilians\) with pride. Therefore, He must be a God of Dravidians only and not of Aryans, isn’t it?

Answer: - Categorising Gods as Aryan and Dravidian is itself simply *Aśāstrīya*. It is as ridiculous as distinguishing the Sun as the Aryan Sun and the Dravidian Sun. It also becomes a matter of offence to God to deny his glory, who reigns over all the living beings of the universe.

Moreover, the statement that the worship of *“Kumārasvāmi’* is confined only to *Dravida Deśa* is also not correct. There are people in North India who have been worshipping him since ages. One of the Gupta emperors of North India is renowned by the very name *‘Kumāragupta’*. The great poet *kālidāsa* a north Indian, has written a *kāvya* itself by name *‘Kumāra sambhava’* which highlights the glory of *Kumārasvāmī*. Even in his poem *Meghasandeśa*, the worship of *Kumārasvāmī* who is *‘Śaravaṇa bhava’* is mentioned. In the *Rāmāyaṇa,* the *Mahābhārata* and the *purāṇas* which are the property and the wealth of the whole of India, his divine story has been depicted. The places *kraunca parvata*, *Kumāraguha* etc., are located in North India only.

Question 2:- Even though the stories of *Kumārasvāmi* are available in *Itihāsas* and *purāṇas*, it is not found in the *Vedas*. Therefore, is he not an *avaidika devatā*.?

Answer: None of the Gods that have manifested to the inner eye of *jnānis* and described by them, can be an *avaidika devatā*. Because, in our tradition, \(works such as\) the *smṛtis*, the *purāṇas, Itihāsas,* and *āgamas* which are not opposed to the *Vedas*, are accepted as treatises of authority. They are accepted as *“Anumita śruti”* and honored on par with the *Vedas*. Now, as *Kumārasvāmi* is very clearly described in *Śrīmadrāmāyaṇa*, *Itihāsas, purāṇas* and *āgamas*, we shall call him a *vaidika devatā* only. The *yogic* vision of the *jnānis* itself is the *vaidika dṛshṭi*. How can a *devatā* that is manifested to the inner eyes of *jnānis* and described by them, be a an *a-vaidika devata*? Forgetting this tattva, categorization of *devatās* as *vaidika* and *avaidika* serves no purpose that is useful for the upliftment of the soul.

The study of the *devatās* taken up by us should be for the sole purpose of spiritual benefit and not for the mere satisfaction of intellectual curiosity.

It is not right also to claim that the name of *‘Shaṇmukhasvāmī’* is not found anywhere in vedic literature. His name is indeed clearly mentioned in *Shaṇmukhagāyatri*, in the *Mahanārāyaṇa* which is the concluding part of the *Āranyopanishat* of the *Taitthirīyaśākhā* of *Kṛshṇa yajurveda* ‘तत्पुरुषाय विद्महे महासेनाय धीमहि । तन्नःषण्मुखः प्रचोदयात्” ॥

Question 3: The above mentioned *Mahanārāyaṇa* is an *Upanishad* of recent origin. How can it be accepted as a part of authentic vedic literature?

The *Ṛshis* who had the divine vision of the *Vaidika mantras* have mentioned only the name of the *ṛshi*, *devatā* and *chandas*, and have not involved themselves in mentioning the date or month or the year of them. It is because, the *tattvas* told by them are universal and timeless. Therefore, we have no reliable evidence to classify the *vaidika mantras* as ancient and modern.

However, no one can refuse to agree that the *‘Mahanārāyaṇopanishath’* is *Ārsheya*. Sage *Āpastamba* has called it as *‘Yājnikīupanishat’* and has prescribed the offering of *tarpaṇa* in the ritual of *upākarma* for those sages who are the presiding deities of \(that *Upanishad*\).

Question 4:- Though the name of Lord *Shaṇmukha-MahāsenaDeva* appears in the *Upanishats*, he could be a concept of recent origin. This is because he has no place in the *‘Pañcāyatana pūjākalpa*.

The names of *Āditya, Ambikā, Vishṇu, Gaṇeśa* and *Śiva* appear in the *Pañcāyatana* worship. These five represent the five great elements viz *Pṛthvī*, *ap tejas, Vāyu* and *Ākāśa*. *Gaṇeśa* represents the *tattva* of *Pṛthvi*. *Vishṇu* represents the of *\(tattva\)* of *‘ap’*. *Āditya* represents the *tattva* of *tejas*. *Ambikādevi* represents the *tattva* of *Vāyu* and *Maheśvara* represents the last *tattva* i.e. *ākāśa*. The *Mahābhūtas* are only five in number and there is no sixth *Mahābhūta* above them. It is possible to match only the above five deities as representatives of the five *Mahābhūtas*. This adaptation has been accomplished already. So, the concept of *Kumārasvāmi* should be of recent origin only. Isn’t it?

Answer: Where indeed is this adaptation formula of yours found in the *śāstras*? You are caught in the web of your own imagination and you are trying to hook the five deities viz *Āditya* and others to that, and so you have no right to term *Kumārasvāmī* as an outsider. It is against the scriptures to limit the great deities viz *Nārāyaṇa* and others to reign over just one each of the *Mahābhūtas*. Actually, as *the Vedas* proclaim “नारायण एवेदं सर्वम्” ‘सर्वो वै रुद्रः ’, they are allpervading and the Lords of all the *tattvas*.

Question 5: Then why is it that in the *pūjākalpas* of *pañcāyatana* worship, only five *devatās* have been mentioned dropping *Kumārasvāmī?*

Answer: - *Pūjākalpas* are many in number. In some of them *Gaṇeśa* is mentioned and in some he is not. For example in the *kalpa* of *Rāmapañcāyatana*, *Gaṇeśa* is not mentioned. Therefore it is not right to conclude that *Gaṇeśa* is a concept of recent times.

There is a reason for mentioning only *Āditya, Ambikā, Vishṇu, Gaṇeśa* and *Śiva* in the *Pañcāyatana pūjākalpa* you have mentioned above. Generally, the *gṛhastha upāsakas* desire for five benefits specially.

1. Obstacle free deeds 
2. Health 
3. power of wealth 
4. *jnāna* and 
5. *Moksha*. 

The five forms of the supreme deity who have been authorized to directly and specially grant these five benefits are *Gaṇeśa, Āditya, Śakti, Śiva,* and *Nārāyaṇa* respectively. The following statements of the *śāstras* attest the above.

> आरोग्यं भास्करादिच्छेत् श्रियमिच्छेद्धुताशनात् ।  
> ईश्वरात् ज्ञानमन्विच्छेत् मोक्षमिच्छेज्जनार्दनात् ॥  
\(Vaidyanāthiya Ahnikakānda- Devapūjāprakaraṇa\)  
‘ श्रियं देवीमुपह्व्ये श्रीर्मा देवी जुषतां ” \(श्रीसूक्त\) 

*Śāstras* have prescribed a *kalpa* of worshipping those five *devatās* for the householder devotees who practice *Pañcayajnas*, for the special *siddhi* of those five benefits.

> आदित्यमम्बिकां विष्णुं गणनाथं महेश्वरम् ।  
> पायज्ञपरो नित्यं गृहस्थः पञ्च पूजयेत् ॥ 

\(Quoted in the *Smṛtisaṅgraha-Vaidyanāthīya*\) \(*Āhnikakānḍa—devapūjāprakaraṇa*\)

Also, there is a *darśana* which mentions the worship of *Kumārasvāmī* and *pūjākalpas* are also there. As we have noted earlier, *Skānda darśana* is also famous like the *Śaiva, Vaishṇava, Śakta* and *Gāṇāpatya darśanas*. The glorious story of *Skanda* has been clearly rendered in *Sruti, Smṛti, purāṇa* and *Itihāsas*. There is no proof or evidence in them to conclude that *Gāṇapatya darśana* is ancient and *Skānda darśana* is of recent origin. In the *Yājnikī Upanishat*, both *Gaṇeśa* and *Skanda Gāyatrī* mantras are stated together. In both of them the *Liṅga* of the word *‘tatpurusha’* which states relationship to *Śiva* is there. Both of them carry equal importance.

In the *Gṛhyapariśishta* also, the worship of *Skanda* and *Gaṇapati* have been stated together. “ते देवाः गणपतिर्वा स्कन्दो वा सूर्यो वा सरस्वती वा गौरीपतिर्वा श्रीपतिर्वा अन्यो वा अभिमतस्त एते यथारुचि समस्ताव्यस्ता वा इज्यन्ते” It is also stated there that these *devatās* may be worshipped together or separately. There no proof whatsoever to identify the worship of *Skanda* as modern. Even in *Amarakośa* the names of *Skanda* have been mentioned after the names of *Gaṇeśa*.

Question 5:- We agree to the point that distinguishing the worships of the two as ancient and modern is not correct, as the description of *Gaṇeśa* and *Skanda* are found together in *Sruti, Itihāsa, purāṇas* etc. But there is no doubt in the fact that it is only the South Indians who have given the name *‘Subrahmaṇya’* to *Skanda*. It is not seen anywhere in the ancient *nāmāvalis* of *Kumārasvāmī*. It is not seen even in the names of *Kumārasvāmī* in the *Amarakośa*. This name *‘Kumārasvāmi’* is not taken by the North Indians, isn’t it?

Answer: Yes, that name does not find a mention in the *Amarakośa*. But the name *Subrahmaṇya* is seen in the ancient Vedic literature itself. It is not a name \(given\) by the South Indians. *Śrutis* clearly proclaim that name. “ *Subrahmaṇyo, Subrahmaṇyo Subrahmaṇyom”*. \(Taittirīya āraṇyaka\) In this quote it stands for *Indra*. The *sāmaprakāra* in the *Vedas*- viz., *Subrahmaṇya sāma* is also well known. The meaning of the word is as follows:—

The word *Brahma* means one who is a benefactor and the one who is well disposed towards *Vedas - Tattvas* and *Tapas*. \(*“Brahmaṇe hitah” “Brahmaṇi Sādhuh”* - suffix *yat*.\) In this sense it applies to Indra also and *MahāVishṇu* also. “ब्रह्मण्यो ब्रह्मकृत् ब्रह्म” “नमो ब्रह्मण्यदेवाय गोब्राह्मणहिताय च” Ancient *nāmavalis* of *Kumāra* express the word *‘Brahmaṇya”* to denote *Kumārasvāmī* also.

For example, the *Mahābhārata* mentions the word *Brahmaṇya* with reference to *Kumārasvāmī* as follows:-

> ब्रह्मण्यो ब्रह्मदेवश्च ब्रह्मदो ब्रह्मसङग्रहः \(स्कान्दपुराण, स्कन्द अष्टोत्तर\)  
> स हि मे भविता भर्ता ब्रह्मण्यः कीर्तिवर्धनः । \(महाभारत, वनपर्व 224-9\)  
> “जातं ब्रह्मर्षिभार्याभिः ब्रह्मण्यं कीर्तिवर्धनम् \(अध्याय 223-2\)  
> ब्रह्मण्यो वै ब्रह्मजो ब्रह्मविच्च \(अध्याय 232-11\) 

It \(i.e. the word *Brahmaṇya*\) is prefixed by *‘Su’* which stands for the sense ‘excellent’ and thus the word *Subrahmaṇya* gloriously denotes the great deity *Kumārasvāmī*. This is an ancient name which is celebrated in the *śāstras*.

Question 6: Ancient *purāṇa*s and *Itihāsas* describe *Kumārasvāmī* as a form of God, having six heads, twelve ears, twelve eyes and arms, one neck and only one \(belly\) and Holding the weapon. *Śakti*.

> षट्शिरा द्विगुणश्रोत्रो द्वादशाक्षिभुजक्रमः ।  
> एकग्रीवैकजठरः कुमारः समपद्यत  
> द्वाभ्यां गृहीत्वा पाणिभ्यां शकिं चान्येन पाणिना \(महा. वनपर्व 225-17-24\) 

In some places he is depicted as having one face, two eyes, wearing matted hair on top of the head as a crown, having four arms, holding the *vajrāyudha*, the *śaktyāyudha*, a *kukkuṭa*, and sporting the *abhayamudrā*.

> एकवक्त्रं द्विनेत्रं च जटामकुटसंयुतम् ।  
> चतुर्भुजैर्वज्रशक्तिकुक्कुटाभयधारिणम् ॥ 

And he is also described as having two faces, eight arms, and holding the *kukkuṭa, kheṭaka* \(shield\), *vajra, ājyapātra, sruva, akshamālā, khadga* and *svastika*.

> द्विमुखं चाष्टबाहुं च श्वेतं वा श्यामकं दधत् ।  
> स्रुवाक्षमालां खड्गं च स्वस्तिकं दक्षिणे करे ॥  
> कुक्कुटं खेटकं वज्रं आज्यपात्रं तु वामके ।  
> अग्निहोत्रविधिं देवमग्निजातस्वरूपकम् ॥ \(शैवागम शेखर\) 

All of these are the different divine forms of *Śrī Kumārasvāmī*. They are *devata mūrtis* which have a marvelous male form. But this *Subrahmaṇya* has nowhere been described in the *śāstras* as having the form of a serpent. When such is the case why did the custom of worshipping *Subrahmaṇya* in the form of a serpent come into practice? Why did the *devatāmūrti* become a *sarpamūrti?* In general usage, the words *Subrahmaṇya* or *Subbarāya* bring to the minds of ordinary devotees, only the picture of a serpent and not the six-faced deity. Therefore the attribution of the serpent form to the deity in a male form is only the result of a concept of recent times, isn’t it?

Answer:- Meditating upon a deity having a serpent form is renowned in *śāstras* since ancient times. Even in the experiences of *yoga* the *Kunḍalinī* in the shape of a serpent or *Prana śaktisvarupa* is established as direct evidence of truth. This is no modern concept. Even if that divine *Kunḍalinī* serpent form is meditated upon in a particular stage, it will lead to the *darśana* of the divine auspicious form of *Kumārasvāmi* to the *yogis*, at a distinct time.

It is indeed proper to call such a pure *Kunḍalinī* serpent form as *Subrahmaṇyasvāmi*, which facilitates the *darśana* of *Kumārasvāmi*. Is not a *Saligrama* stone that facilitates the *darśana* of *‘Lakshmīnārāyaṇa’* called as *Lakshmīnārāyaṇamūrti*? In the same way, even though this experiment leads to the *darśana* of *Kumārasvāmi* in the form of a serpent in the beginning, the manifestation of the deity *Shaṇmukha* occurs in deeper meditation and on a deeper immersion, He, the Lord of *yoga* is visualized as total effulgence. In the *Ashṭottara* of *Skanda*, in the *śloka* नागराजः सुधर्मात्मा नाकपृष्ठः सनातनः , the word *‘Nāgarāja’* clearly denotes his serpent form. When it is so, why should one try to wrongly interpret it as a concept of recent times?

Question 7:- This is a *tāttvik* description. Are there any evidences to prove that *Kumārasvāmi* assumed the form of a serpent?

Answer: - Yes. We shall present two stories in briefly. “When Lord *Kumārasvāmi* fought *Tārakāsura*, the panicked demon assumed the form of a an insect and disappeared into an anthill to remain incognito. To catch him, as *Kumārasvāmi* assumed the form of a serpent and entered the ant hill, the demon with no other alternative, ran outside, faced the God in his demonical form itself and was killed”. This is one story. The divine serpent appearing in the anthill of *Sushumnā* and invading the demonical power which was in the form of an insect, is indeed nothing but Lord *Subrahmaṇya* in the form the of pure *Kunḍalinī* serpent.

Lord *Śiva* got angry because *Kumārasvāmi* insulted *Brahmadeva* and cursed him to become a serpent. *Kumāra* with full respect, accepted the curse and came to *‘Valmīka kshetra’* \(at present called *‘Kukke Subrahmaṇya’*\) and hid himself in a cave there and came to be called *‘Guha”*. When *Takshaka* and *Vāsuki* came there and sought refuge, the Lord made them merge in his ownself and blessed them to become pleased by the worship offered to himself. Then he assumed the form of a great serpent and entered into a cavity and became *yogārūḍha*. In the pilgrimage center called *Kukke Subrahmaṇya*, we can see all the three ie. *Skandamūrti*, *Śeshasarpamūrti* and *Vāsukisarpamūrti* in the sanctum sanctorum.

*Skanda* assumed the form of a great serpent by the *saṅkalpa* of *Śiva* only, to facilitate devotees to meditate. *Takshaka* and *Vāsuki* are also *Amśas* of that great *Kunḍalinī*, the deity of *Mahāprāṇas*. These *amśas*, accept the worship offered to the *Amśi* the great deity *Kumārasvāmi* from his devotees, and become pleased by the gulps of *ambrosia* graced as *prasāda* by him. It may be remembered here that deities live upon only by consuming the drops of the *Ānandāmṛta mahāsāgara* of the supreme deity, which the *upanishats* say” “एतस्यैव मात्रामुपजीवन्ति”

Question 8: Why did *Śiva* pronounce a curse on his dear son *Kumārasvāmi?*

Answer: - There is an interesting background to this. Lord *Śiva* entrusted *Brahmadeva* the responsibility of performing *Aksharābhyāsa* to *Kumārasvāmi*. *Brahmadeva* wrote *‘OM’* and asked *Kumārasvāmi* to trace it. The disciple asked his guru to teach him the meaning of *‘OM’*. The teacher told him—‘Child, it is very difficult. At present you won’t understand it even if I tell you. Just trace what I have written down; That is enough’. But that naughty boy replied—“Sir, you don’t know the meaning. That is why you are advancing excuses like this’. *Brahmadeva* got angry and told him 4000 meanings of the *Praṇava*. From each of his face came one thousand meanings \(*Brahmadeva* has four faces\). But the naughty boy was not satisfied. He went beyond and said, Sir, there is no fool like you\!’ and started lashing *Brahmadeva* with a whip. *Brahmadeva* had to suffer six thousand whiplashes. Each of those lashes was making the sound *‘OM’ ‘OM’* of *praṇava*. Finally, left with no alternative, *Brahma* reported the misbehaviour of this wicked disciple to *Śiva. Śiva* advised his son in the assembly and told him “There are five thousand meanings to the *pranava*. As you are still a little boy, *Brahmadeva* told you four thousand meanings only. You insulted him saying ‘There is no fool like you’. For this you should beg his pardon”.

*Kumārasvāmi* with a mischievous smile on his face said “It was wrong on my part to have told *Brahmadeva* like that”. Then he told his father that there are six thousand meanings for the *Praṇava* and preached them it to his father himself. As he taught Lord *Śiva* himself, he came to be called *svāminātha*. Even then *Śiva* was angry with him for being ridiculed and cursed him to become a serpent-This is the background of the story.

The *tattva* that emerges here is that it is only *Kumārasvāmi* the supreme deity of *Nāda* that occupies the pride of place in the matter of expounding the meaing of *praṇava*. The *Vaikhānasāgama* says that *Kumārasvāmi* should be invoked in the *nāda* of a bell, while it is being installed. And, this story also drives home a moral that knowledge is more important than age.

Question 9:- All these are fine. But the stories appearing in *Itihāsas* and *purāṇas* about the birth of *Kumārasvāmi* cause a lot of disgust. *“Agni* drank the semen of *Śiva*. He let it out in the river *Gaṅgā*. The wives of six sages who had no knowledge of this, took a bath in *Gaṅgā* River and became pregnant. *Svahādevi* the wife of Agni sucked that semen from the wives of the sages, or \(according to another story\), she took it in her cupped hands joined together. She went on placing it in a golden pot covered with *darbha* grass. Thus *Subrahmaṇyasvāmi* who was born like that, came to be known as *skanda*, because of the semen that slid *\(skanna\)*. He came to be called *‘Shāṇmātura’* as he was breastfed by six mothers i.e. the six *krittikādevīs*. Both *Śiva* and *Agni* put forth the claim of paternity. And *Pārvatī Devī, Gaṅgā Devī, Krittikā Devī* and the wives of *Brahmarshis* - all these began to claim the motherhood of *Kumārasvāmi*. Then *Kumārasvāmi* approached them in different forms and convinced everyone of them to happily feel that he was the son of all of them”. This is the story.

Some people look at this story with disgust and say—“How can this become a sacred story? How many fathers\! How many mothers for this male God\!.” And some ridicule also. Some people even drew cartoons and exhibited them. To a common man, the reactions of these people appear quite natural, isn’t it?

Answer: But these fools have forgotten two principles here—

1. One should not measure the acts of great deities who are above *Dharma* and *Adharma*, with the yardstick of the standards applicable to ordinary people. 
2. Deities don’t need to follow the rules applicable to human beings. 

**Here, we would like to humbly remember the example given by *Śrī Raṅgagurudeva*. He said- “The rule that buttermilk and cold water should not be consumed is meant for a patient and should not be imposed on a healthy person. And a healthy person should not be blamed for disobeying the rule.” So also, not all the acts of devatās are models for \(human beings\) “न देवचरितं चरेत्। ”**

\(2\) The above said story of the incarnation of *Kumārasvāmi* is not a collection of events in history. It is a story of the assembly of spiritual principles. “रुद्रोऽग्निः स्विष्टकृत्” says that *Agni* is a part and a glory of Lord *Rudra. Gaṅgā Devi, Svāha Devi, Pṛthvi Devi* and the wives of *Maharshis* etc, are all the *vibhūtis* of Goddess *Pārvatīdevi*. *Kumārasvāmi* is a deity born of the divine interaction of all these glories and a form of the divine effulgence of *Śiva*, which makes everyone happy. *Kumārasvāmi* is a great deity endowed with all the divine glories and characters such as \(divine\) knowledge, power, wealth, valour, effulgence, strength, beauty, kindness and concern etc. He bestows all the *purushārthas* upon his devotees. All his six heads are the six divine *siddhis*. His *Ātmaśakti* itself is his *śaktyāyudha* which destroys the evil forces like *Tārakāsura* and others, who could not be subdued even by the *devatās*. The *Śaktyāyudha* is broad \(gross\) at the base, but getting sharper \(subtler\) \(as it moves\) upwards, becomes very sharp at the uppermost point, and penetrates into the vital parts of the enemy. His vehicle the peacock is a *Māyāśakti*. Though it keeps bewitching the world by unfolding its multicolored feathers, it directs the *jnānis* towards the *Ātmeśvara*, sporting the signs of *soma*, *Surya* and *Agni manḍala* and *Praṇava* on the feathers. The crest of divine knowledge is shining forth on its head and also on the head of the cock which is the flag of *Kumārasvāmi*. These are the *\(tattvas\)* that are taught to us by the *divya maṅgala vigraha* of *Kumārasvāmi*.

This story also proclaims the *tattva* that \(even\) his divine glories are unable to bear the divine effulgence of *paramātma* completely. When one discerns at the above said stories of his birth without the comprehension of the *tattvas* that are behind them, aversion is naturally caused. But when we look at them from the *tattvadṛsṭi* bestowed upon by *jnānis*, they fill us with supreme bliss only. There may be some differences in the parts of the stories described by different *purāṇas*. But none of them lack the *tattva* part. The *Mahābhārata* says us that *Viśvāmitra* among the *saptarshis*, realised the mystery of the birth of the Lord in the *tattvik* way and performed the rites of *Jātakarma* etc to the Lord for his own satisfactionand became very dear to Him. One of the names in the *Nāmāvalis* of *Kumārasvāmi* is *‘Viśvāmitrapriya’*. The *jnānis* say that the great Sage *Viśvāmitra* had specialized in the divine knowledge of the *Agni tattva*. Thus, he understood the mystery of *Skanda* the son of *Agni*, well before others.

*Kumārasvāmi* is the supreme glory of the highest deity, by his birth, character and deeds. He is full of effulgence of all these i.e. *Mahādeva, Mahādevī, Gaṅgā Devī, Agnideva, Svāhadevī* and the wives of *Brahmarshis*. He shines brightly like the flames of the burning fire, with a weapon that is *tattvarūpa*, jewels and retinue. Just on the sixth day of his incarnation, he astonished even *Indra* by his valor and gave him *abhaya*. He tore apart the *‘Kraunca’* mountain. He vanquished the *yoga vighnas* in the form of *Tāraka*, *Mahisha, Tripāda, Hradodara,* son of *Tāraka*, Brother of *Taraka* and others who were a bane to the world.

He is the mysterious *‘Guha’* who dwells in the caves of the hearts of the *yogis*. He was crowned in the *ātmasāmrājya* just as he was crowned by deities as the commander of the armies of *Devas*. He was very humble though he possessed these divine powers. He was full of the divine ambrosia of love. Even though *Indra* was much inferior to him in prowess, he comforts and consoles *Indra* with the words “अहं ते किङ्करः शक्र” \(*“O Indra*, I am your servant”.\) He delights all the great souls who came to him calling him their son. The *Śivapurāṇa* says that even though he is the younger brother of *Gaṇeśa*, he is also considered as a *Gaṇapati* of *Śiva*. There is no great quality that he does not possess.

> शक्तिर्धर्मो बलं तेजः कान्तत्वं सत्यमुन्नतिः।  
> ब्रह्मण्यत्वमसम्मोहः भक्तानां परिरक्षणम्॥ 

> निकृन्तनं च शत्रूणां लोकानां चाभिरक्षणम्।  
> स्कन्देन सह जातानि सर्वाण्येव जनाधिप ॥ \(महाभारत, वनपर्व 229-36-37\) 

Question 10:- Which is the peacock that is described by the *śāstras* as the vehicle of *Kumārasvāmi*?

Answer: - It is not just some ordinary peacock that we see in the external world. It is the all enchanting *Yogamāya* of God. It charms ordinary people and rides on them. But as *Subrahmaṇya* is a great *devatā* who is a complete *Brahmajnāni*, the game plan of *Yogamāya* does not work on him. He himself takes control of it and rides on it.

Question 11:- Which are the marks of *Yogamāya* on the peacock?

Answer: - We have already described in the article on *Śrīkṛshṇajayanti*, the significance of the peacock feather, worn as an ornament by *Śrīkṛshṇaparamātma*. To put it briefly here, just as the peacock bewitches people with its multi colored feathers, so also *Māya* strongly beguiles ordinary people who are not devotees of God. As this *Māya* is also an ornament of the Lord, he has imprinted his marks also on it. We see the natural figures which represent the *soma*, *Sūrya* and *Agni manḍala* on the feathers of the peacock, as described in the *Yogaśāstra*. We can also see the marks of *Praṇava*. On top of the head of the peacock we can see the crest that indicates the tuft of divine knowledge. How natural it is that the peacock shaped *Māya tattva* with all the above said divine features happens to be the vehicle of *Kumārasvāmi*\! This is not just a description borne out of our imagination. **This is a matter that was expounded by *Śrīgurubhagavān* who was endowed with the realization of *tattvas*. Salutations again and again to *Subrahmaṇya* the *Śikhivāhana***.

Question 12:- Why is *Kumārasvāmi* called by the famous names viz. *Skanda*, *Guha* and *Śarajanmā*?

When the efflugence of *Lord Rudra* slid \(*skanna*\), it assumed the form of *Kumārasvāmi* and so, he is called *Skanda*. As he is \(mystically\) \(hidden\) in the caves of the hearts of the *yogis*, he is called *‘Guha’* by *yogis*. Ordinarily the name *‘Guha’* is explained as ‘the one who guards his army \(i.e. who guards from the attack of the enemies\) in his capacity as *Devasenāpati*. \( गुहू संवरणे, गूहति रक्षति सेनां इति गुहः\)

The word *Śarajanmā* means the one who was born in the *darbhas.* The *purāṇas* say that *Shaṇmukhasvāmi* incarnated in the forest of *darbha* grass on the banks of river *Gaṅgā*. For this reason he is also called *Śaravaṇabhava*.

This forest of *darbha* is not the phenomenon of the external world. It is, in fact, a description of the *yogabhūmi*. The incarnation of *Subrahmaṇya* the *‘Yogīśa’* can be in this *yogabhūmi* only. Which is this *yogabhūmi*? That *yogabhūmi* is the place of the inner heart, which is a refuge for hundred of *nādis* that resemble reeds heaped together. “शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्यः” *\(Kaṭhopanishat*\). Thus, the *yogis* call that form of *Tejas* which incarnated in the distinct *yogabhūmi* as *‘Śarajanmā’* and *‘Śaravaṇabhava’*.

Question 13:- Why does *Chandogyopanishat* call *Skanda Subrahmaṇya* as *‘Sanatkumāra’* also?

Answer: - “तस्मै मृदितकषायाय तमसस्पारं दर्शयति भगवान् सनत्कुमारः तं स्कन्द इत्याचक्षते तं स्कन्द इत्याचक्षत इति”. To the fortunate person who has shed all the blemishes, *Bhagavān Śrī SanatKumāra* shows the shore which is beyond *tamas*. That *‘Sanatkumāra’* is also called *‘Skanda’*.

Question 14; How can *Sanatkumāra*, who is well known in the *purāṇas* as the *mānasaputra* of Lord *Brahma* become *Skanda* the son of *Rudra*?

Answer: The name *Subrahmaṇya* which stands for the one who is a *Brahmanishṭha* and well disposed to *Brahman*, applies to both *Sanatkumāra* the son of *Brahmadeva* and *Skanda* the son of *Rudra*. *Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavatpāda* in his *Brahmasūtra Bhāshya* states that *Sanat Kumāra*, the son of *Brahmadeva* himself incarnated as *Skanda* also according to the grant of a boon.

“सनत्कुमारोऽपि ब्रह्मण एव मानसः पुत्रः स्वयं रुद्राय वरप्रदानात् स्कन्दत्वेन प्रादुर्बभूव \(*ŚānkaraBrahmasūtra bhāshya Adhyāya* \(chapter 3, *Adhikaraṇa* 19, as related to *sūtra* 32\)

Question 15:- You have earlier described that *Kumārasvāmi* appears with a radiant face, hands, feet and weapons to *yogis* in meditation and also that the *darśana* of serpent shaped effulgences occurs some times. In what state does this happen?

Answer: ***Śrī Raṅga Gurudeva* the preeminent among yogis has stated that those who meditate in the *Shaṇmukhī mudra***, the *darśana* of the effulgent lights in the form of a serpent in place of the forms of *devatās* happens.

Salutations to *Brahmacāri BālaSubrahmaṇya*, who received the *samskāraseva* from *Brahmarshi Viśvāmitra*. Salutations to the young *Subrahmaṇya* who is together with *Devasenā* and *Vallīdevī*, and is served by *Devendra* and others. Salutations to the valiant commander *Subrahmaṇya* who gaily killed *Tāraka* and other wicked demons who were inviolable as a playful sport and protected the world. Salutations to *Subrahmaṇya* who has the greatness of preaching *Ātmajnāna* even to *Nārada* and others and who is the form of *SanatKumāra* who in turn is *Ātmajnānabhāskara*, the *mānasaputra* of *Brahma* and who is the foremost among the *avadhūtas*.

“स्मृतिलम्भे सर्वग्रन्थीनां विप्रमोक्षः, तस्मै मृदितकषायाय तमसस्पारं दर्शयति भगवान् सनत्कुमारः, तं स्कन्द इत्याचक्षते तं स्कन्द इत्याचक्षत इति”

“When the *dhruvadhyāna* of the true form of \(*paramātma* is accomplished, all the knots of the heart get untied. *Bhagavān Sanatkumāra* shows the shore which is beyond *tamas*, to the one who has shed all the blemishes. He is the one who is called *Skanda*”. Salutations first to that *SanatKumāra Skanda Subrahmaṇya* who manifests in the heart of the *Guru*, \(who is a\) *Śrī Guruparañjyoti*, who is *turīya* and *turīyātīta* as declared by *Chandagyopanishatdevi*.

Question 16:- On the day of *Subbrāyana Shashṭhī*, the invited *Brahmacārī* is served with some food items of the *Śrāddha* ceremony, like blackgram *vada* etc. There is a rule that both the *Brahmacāri* and the host householder should follow *Ekabhukta*. So, is there any relation between this *Parva* and *śrāddha* which is a *pitṛkarma*?

Answer: - Yes. They are related from two view points.

A\) It is proper that people desirous of progeny worship the *Pitṛ devatas*. It is the *pitṛdevatas* only who are worshipped on that day of the *Shashṭhiparva* for progeny and for the protection of progeny. Therefore some rules pertaining to *śrāddha*, like the preparation of food items of *śrāddha* are being followed.

b\) *Kārtikeya* \(*Kumārasvāmī*\) is considered as one of the Gods who grants salvation to the *pitṛs*. The following *śloka* which is chanted during the *śrāddha* ceremony, is the proof for that.

> ईशान-विष्णु-कमलासन-कार्तिकेय-वह्नित्रयार्करजनीश गणेश्वराणाम् ।  
> सभ्यावसथ्यदधिकण्वमतङ्गजानां क्रौञ्चमरेन्द्रकलशोद्भवकाश्यपानाम् ।  
> पादान् नमामि सततं पितृमुक्तिहेतून् ॥ 

Therefore it is natural that the special *niyamas* of *Pitṛ karma* are being observed on the day of worship of the Lord, who bestows *Mukti* to the *pitṛs*.

Question. 17:- Which is the dwelling place of *Kumārasvāmī* in the human body?

Answer: - There are seventeen different forms of *Kumārasvāmī*. Among them the *Dhyānasthāna* of *‘Guhasubrahamaṇya’* is *“Anāhathacakra*- the place of the heart.

*Pramāṇa śloka*:-

> चतुर्भुजं त्रिनेत्रं च हेमरत्नकिरीटिनम् ।  
> शूलवज्रधरं सव्ये वरदाभयमन्यके ॥  
> श्वेतवस्त्रधरं देवं सर्वेषां रक्षणोन्मुखम् ।  
> जायया वामपार्श्वे तु कल्याणोत्सवविग्रहम् ।  
> पादाम्बुजं हृदि ध्यात्वा गुहरूपं समाश्रये ॥ \(शैवागम शेखर\) 

It has been already stated that *saravana* the birthplace of *Kumārasvāmi* is the heart, which is the beginning place of the heap of *nādis*. So, just as *Mūlādhara* is the place for *Gaṇeśa*, the *Anāhata cakra* is the place for *Kumārasvāmī*.

But *yogis* may visualise some of his other forms in other places also. For example: - The place of *DeśikaSubrahmaṇya* is *‘Ājnācakra sthāna’* The story of *DeśikaSubrahmaṇya* sitting in the place of a *Guru* and expounding the meaning of *praṇava* to Lord *Śiva* has been narrated earlier.

The description of *DeśikaSubrahmaṇya* is given in the following *śloka*.

षड्भुजं चैकवदनं करण्डमुकुटान्वितं ।  
> शकिहस्तद्वयं चैव जपमालाधरं शिवम् ॥ 

मयूरवाहनारूढं वराभयकराम्बुजम् ।  
> इत्येवं विधिवद्ध्यायेत् शिवदेवस्य देशिकम् ॥ \(शैवागम शेखर\) 

It is appropriate that the place of the *Guru* is *Ājnācakra* and the place of *GuruSubrahmaṇya* also happens to be the same.

Question 18:- Many of The famous *Subrahmaṇya Kshetras* are in South India only. Therefore is South India exceptionally suitable for the worship of *Subrahmaṇya*? \(For example: Like the western sea coast of *Bhārata* which is specially suited for worship of *Gaṇeśa*\).

Answer: It has been stated earlier that there are some pilgrimage centers of *Subrahmaṇyasvāmi* in North India as well. It is true that there are more pilgrimage centers of *Subrahmaṇya* in South India. But, merely on these grounds, we do not have the power or authority to say for certain that South India is more commendable for the \(worship of\) *Kumārasvāmī*.





	 
## Ugādi\* Festival

*Ugādi* is the very first festival which comes on the first day of the month of *Caitra* every year. This is a great festival which is celebrated all over India and considered an important festival in the *Śāstras*. The multifaceted importance of this festival can be summarised as follows:

1. This day is an auspicious beginning of the year, season, month, the fortnight and above all, is in the form of an introduction for the whole year. This is a day on which a plan of activities for the whole year is to be drawn up and an auspicious resolve to be made to act accordingly. And a day, when a discreet arrangement has to be contemplated after reviewing the performance of the previous year. There is a belief that resolves made on this day will be entirely very influential. Resolves for that matter, made on any day by men of great will power can be strong and effective. But, in the case of laymen, it is quite possible that the resolves and vows taken on this day, by virtue of the glory of the beginning day of the year to cause a deep impact on all their endeavours.

Some have a feeling that any incident good or bad, happening on this day, may recur throughout the year. Whatever may be the fact, it will help people to feel inspired, to look for the good fruits of *Dharma* and *Karma* throughout the year, as their minds will be in a good state as a result of laudable contemplations and deeds performed on that day.

2. The planet corresponding to the week day on this day of *Ugādi*, is considered the regining deity for the whole year. For example, if it is a Thursday, *Bṛhaspati* \(Jupiter\) will be the reigning Lord for the entire year.

Lord *Prajāpati* created the world at dawn on the first day of the *ŚuklaPaksha* of the month of *Caitra* and initiated the reckoning of time. Then he handed over the limbs \(components\) of time to gods and commanded them to continue the work of creation.

“चैत्रे मासि जगद् ब्रह्मा ससर्ज प्रथमेऽहनि ।  
> शुक्लपक्षे समग्रं तु तथा सूर्योदये सति ॥  
> प्रवर्तयामास तथा कालस्य गणनामपि”  
—*Says the Brahmapurāṇa.* 

3. The *Smṛtikaustubha* says, “God took the *avatāra* of *Matsyā* during the daytime of *Vishkambhaka Yoga* when the star of the day was *Revatī*.” \(The significance of this creation and incarnation will be explained later.\)

4. If it is a new year day as per the solar calendar, the day and night will be of equal duration, as that day will be invariably a ‘*Vishu*’ \(vernal equinox\). This equability lends a special inspiration to the *sādhakas*.

5. The *Vasantanavarāthrā* begins on that day, which heralds the worship of *ŚrīRāma* and *Durgā*.

6. A highly auspicious time spanning a duration 3½ hours called *muhūrta*, occurs every year \(on certain days.\) And it is believed, *Ugādi* is one such day.

7. The reckoning of *VikramaŚaka* said to be begun by emperor *Vikramāditya* in North India, and the *Śalivāhanaśaka* by king *Śalivāhana* in South India, begins from this *caitra śukla prathama* only.

8. Not only the followers of the vedic tradition, even the Iranians observe the beginning of the year from this day only, and they call it ‘*Nauroj*’. Thus this festival day is very important from both the scriptural point of view and the belief and traditions of the common man.

Let us consider the various names and their meanings associated with this *Parva*.

### Names
Various Names associated with the festival of *Ugādi* and their significance.

In the Tamil country *Ugādi Parva* is called *Citra Vishu*. In North India it is called by the names *Samvatsarapratipadā, Navavarsha-pratipadā, Samvatsarārambha* etc., All these names are in accordance with the significance of this festival.

The word *Ugādi* means the beginning of a *Yuga,* “युगस्य आदिः”. The three well known meanings of the word *Yuga* are, the yoke, a twofold thing and a special \(duration of\) time. Here, the word \(*Yuga*\) denotes the \(special\) time. The four yugas are *Kṛtā \(Satyā\), Tretā, Dvāpara* and *Kali.* They begin on *Vaiśākhaśuklatṛtīya, Kārtikaśuklanavamī, Bhādrapada kṛshṇatrayodaśī* and *Māghapūrṇimā* respectively.

> वैशाखे शुक्लपक्षे तु तृतीयायां कृतं युगम् ।  
> कार्तिके शुक्लपक्षे तु त्रेताथ नवमेऽहनि ॥  
> अथ भाद्रपदे कृष्णत्रयोदश्यां तु द्वापरम् ।  
> माघे च पौर्णमास्यां वै घोरं कलियुगं स्मृतम् ॥ 

But the *Cāndra Ugādi* referred to here falls on the day of *Caitraśuklaprathamā*. This day does not conform to the reckoning of any of the above *yugas*. And this does not conform to the meaning of the following *śloka* also.

> \(नवम्यां शुक्लपक्षस्य कार्तिके निरगात्कृतम् ।  
> त्रेता सिततृतीयायां वैशाखे द्वापरं युगम् ।  
> दर्शे वै माघमासस्य त्रयोदश्यां नभस्यके।  
> कृष्णे कलिं विजानीयात् ज्ञेया मन्वन्तरादयः \(अग्नि 209-14 II\) 

Although this is not the beginning of any *Yuga* in the real sense, this can be termed as the beginning of the *Satya yuga* in a way, because it has \(abundant\) right features to start a life full of Dharma and congenial to Satya. Śrī Raṅgamahāguru also has, in his divine message on the day of Ugādi, commanded that this day can be taken as the beginning of Satyayuga. This suits the description given in Brahmapurāṇa that Lord Brahma created the world on this day.

The Lord of *Satyaloka* created the world on this day. This goes to say that he started the *Satyayuga* on this day, as it possesses right merits, and people can plan for a life full of *satya* and *dharma*, and start living accordingly. To say that the world came into existence on the dawn of this day is nothing but saying that the light of *Jnānasūrya* comes up, and the *Satyayuga* commences from that light. Otherwise, a question arises whether the sun existed even before creation, if the purport that “The Lord created the universe after sunrise” is taken in the ordinary sense.

b\) *Samvatsara* means a year. It is a time when seasons change.

“सर्वर्तुपरिवर्तस्तु कालः संवत्सरः स्मृतः”

So, it is appropriate to call this day as the beginning of the *Samvatsara* or year. And it is also apt to call this day as *samvatsara pratipat* or *pratipadā,* as this \(day\) falls on the first day of *caitra* as per the lunar calendar.

c\) According to the *Sauramāna* system, *Ugādi* is celebrated on the day the of vernal equinox. Therefore it is called “*Citra Vishu*.”

Thus, it can be understood that all the words used to denote this festival are meaningful.

How is this holy and auspicious day celebrated in our country now? How can we understand it in it’s real form? What do the *śāstras* and traditions say about the time, hymns, procedures, *prayoga,* and the things to be used in the festival? What is the significance of these? We shall now take up these points for discussion.

This festival is celebrated generally in all the regions of our country in homes, monasteries, *āśramas* and temples. This festival is celebrated on a much grand scale in South India. A person who has great admiration for Indian culture feels sad, because we do not celebrate this festival with the same grandeur, as Christians celebrate their new years’ day. \[“It is a pity that we, Hindus do not celebrate our New Years’ Day as grandly as the Christians do theirs, and in North India, especially, the New Year’s Day is a festival for namesake only in Hindu homes, though it is observed there in some temples.” \(P.S. Sharma in *Utsavacandrika* page 3\)\] We need not feel elated or depressed by comparing us with them in this regard. On the other hand, it is more proper to find for ourselves, as to what the noble *Arya Bhāratīya* sages, who bequeathed this festival to our culture and tradition, told us about the way it has to be celebrated, the purpose to be achieved by that, and how we are celebrating this festival in view of them now.

As stated earlier, this festival is being celebrated nowadays in some places just as a ritual for its sake. In some places it is celebrated with a huge expenditure, wasting of things, and with decoration and pomp. And in some places where it is celebrated in a somewhat better manner, customs such as taking the oil bath, decorating the house, offering special worship to God, listening to the new *pañcaṅga,* remunerating the astrologer \(Almanac reader\), chewing the neem sprouts with jaggery and pepper, and enjoying a variety of dishes with friends and relatives are observed in a routine way. But no one seems to bother why all these are done like this and whether they need to be done with any refinement. Also, many among the present day youth, leave most of the rituals and customs “generously” to the care of the elders and promptly land themselves at the time of lunch\! Among the four *purushārthas* enumerated by the *jnānis* viz *Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksha*, only the third one, i.e. the gratification of senses, is being enjoyed by people to a small extent. But those who cannot afford in terms of money or resources, grieve that they could not celebrate the festival on a grand scale.

And how should one get to know the ideal way of celebrating a festival? One has to study what our *śastras* and traditions say about the right time, materials and the manner \(of celebration the festival\). One has to understand their secret by discrimination, discussion and practical application in a scientific way. If necessary a few changes can be incorporated, without causing discord to the basic principles. Let us now study in some detail, what the *Śāstras* and traditions say in this regard, and practical issues.

**Regarding the Time:** *Cāndramānayugādi* should be observed on the first day of *Caitra śuddha*, \(प्रतिपत् = प्रथमं प्रतिपद्यते चंद्रमाः अस्यां दर्शनीयतां इति प्रतिपत्\) This occurs in the spring season and in *Uttarayaṇa* only.

On that day, the *Prathamā tithi* should be prevailing at the time of Sunrise. In case the *prathamā* extends from the time of sunrise on the first day to the sunrise on the second day or, if the *prathamā tithi* does not pervade at the time of sunrise on both the days, the celebration should be on the first day only.

“वत्सरादौ वसन्तादौ बलिराज्ये तथैव च” ।  
> पूर्वविद्धैव कर्तव्या प्रतिपत् सर्वदा बुधैः ॥  
*\(Nirṇayasindhu, vṛddhavāsishṭhavacana\)* 

*Malamāsa* is not auspicious for any celebration. If *Ugādi* happens to come in *Malamāsa*, should we celebrate it in that month or it in the *Śuddhamāsa*?

1. According to some, the beginning of the year is no doubt in that *Malamāsa* only. But, customs like oil bath, flag hoisting, listening to the *Pañcanga*, chewing the neem sprout etc which are a part of the new year day, should be observed on the first day of the *Śuddha māsa.*

“प्रतिगृहं ध्वजारोहणं, निम्बपत्राशनम् वत्सरादिफलश्रवणं अभ्यङ्गश्च शुद्धमासप्रतिपदिकार्यः” \(धर्मसिन्धु पु 38\)

2. Some others are of the opinion that taking of oil bath and taking the New Year’s vow should be done in *Malamāsa* itself. निष्कर्षस्तु.... मलमास एव कार्य इति वयं प्रतीमः” \(निर्णयसिन्धु. प्रतिपन्निर्णय\) The opinion that the *Śuddhamāsa* is commendable for all auspicious religious functions is proper.

And as said above, it is considered auspicious to perform *Ārogyavṛatas* and *Tilaka Vṛatas* also on *Caitra śuddha Prathama* only.

If *Ugādi* is to be celebrated according to *Sauramāna*, then it should be done on the day of *Meshasaṅkramaṇa.* \(vernal equinox\) The rituals for that auspicious day such as meditation, *dāna* and *tarpaṇa* should be observed either 10 *Naḍis* before or after that auspicious time of *Saṅkramaṇa*.

“वर्तमानतुलामेषे नाड्यस्तूभयतो दश”

b\) ***Vidhividhānas* \(Procedures\):** On that day, early in the morning, taking oil bath with gingelly oil is a must.

> वत्सरादौ वसन्तादौ बलिराज्ये तथैव च ।  
> तैलाभ्यङ्गमकुर्वाणः नरकं प्रतिपद्यते ॥ \(वसिष्ठवचनं, निर्णयसिन्धु\) 

Holding bandal paste and *akshatā* in hand, an auspicious vow should be taken that the *vrata* is being observed on that day for the pleasure of god and attainment of the four *purushārthas*. After the daily worship, the *Mahāśāntikarma* has to be performed. By this all the sins get absolved, and long life, contentment, happiness, nourishment and happiness both in this world and the other worlds are obtained.

“मङ्गल्या च पवित्रा च लोकद्वयसुखावहा”

In the beginning, Lord *Brahma* should be worshipped with *Arghya* and *Pādya.* That Lord holds a rosary and a *sruva* in the right hand, and a *sruk* and a *Kamanḍalu* in the left hand. The devotees should meditate upon him, who is looked upon as shining like gold, with a long beard, and with a mass of matted hair.

> तस्यामादौ च सम्पूज्यः ब्रह्मा कमलसम्भवः ।  
> पाद्यार्घ्यपुष्पधूपैश्च वस्त्राङ्कारभूषणैः ॥ 

> अक्षमालास्रुवं दक्षे वामे स्रुचकमण्डलू ।  
> लम्बकूर्चं च जटिलं हैमं ब्रह्माणमर्चयेत् ॥ \(अग्निपुराण 176-3\) 

Lord *Brahma* should be worshipped with the *mantra* “ॐ तत्सत् ब्रह्मणे नमः” and also with the *Brahma Gāyatri \(mantra\)*. Then, the Lord of Time, in his components such as *Kalā, Nāḍī* and *Muhūrta* should be worshipped with names ending with “*namah*”

\(*Brahma, Kāma, Nimesha, Truṭi, Lava, Kshaṇa, Kāshṭha, Kalā, Nāḍī, Muhūrta, Rātri, Divasa, Paksha, Māsa, Ṛtu, Ayana, Varsha, Ugādi, Graha, Nakshatra, Rāshi, Karana, Yoga*, and the reigning god of the year, are the various components \(limbs\) of the lord of time. In this worship, the following gods along with their huge entourage viz., *Kula Nāga, Manu, Indra, Dakshakanyas, Subhadra, Jayā, Śastra, Astra, Buddhi, Kubera, Nalakūbara, Nidhi, Bhadrakāli, Surabhi, Veda, Vedāṅga, Vedānta, Vidyādhidevatas, Nāga, Yaksha, Suparṇa, Samudra, Uttarakuru, Narakhanda, Pātāla, Saptanaraka, Varāhāvatāra, Saptaloka, Pañca bhūta, Prakṛti, Purusha, Ahaṅkāra, Parvatha, Gaṅgā rivers, and other Saptarshis, Pushkarādi tīrtha, Chandas, Airāvata, Uccaiśravas, Dhanvantari, Gaṇesha, Shanmukha, Vighna, Skandagraha, Skandamātā, Roga, Vālakhilya, Keśava, Agastya, Nārada, Vyāsā and other sages, Apsarās, deities somapa, and Asomapa, Tushita, Āditya, Rudra, Ashvinī, Sādhyas, Maruts, Viśvakarma, Lokpālas, Āyudha, Vāhana, Kavacha, Āsana, Dundubhi, Daitya, Rākshasa, Gandharva, Piśāca, pitṛ, preta, suble deities conceived by the mind and Lord Vishṇu, have to be worshipped.*\)

It is well known that this is the day on which the Lord took the incarnation of *Matsya* and also the day on which *ŚrīRāma* returned to *Ayodhya* after completing fourteen years of exile in the forest and the day on which the citizens of *Ayodhya* began celebrating the praising of the slaying of *Rāvaṇa* by *Rāma*. And also the day on which *Devendra* made a gift of clothes and ornaments to the king ‘*Vasu*’. And so, on this day one should remember those glories of the Lord and of *Indra* and worship them. All these \(gods\) should be worshipped by performing *Homas* with names ending with *Svāhā*. The god of fire carrying the name *Yavishṭha* should be invoked and the above said *homa* should be performed. *Gurus* and their family members should be honoured with clothes and ornaments. And after listening to the learned astrologer who reads out the details of the chiefs of the new year and the related predictions, etc., he should be honoured. He should be offered the *Pañchāṅga* and a water pot in particular. The poor, belonging to all sects, should be suitably gifted with alms. The *śloka*-

> प्राप्ते नूतनवत्सरे प्रतिगृहं कुर्याद्ध्वजारोपणम्  
> स्नानं मङ्गलमाचरेद् द्विजवरैः साकं सुपूज्योत्सवैः ।  
> देवानां गुरुयोषितां च शिशवोऽलङ्कारवस्त्रादिभिः  
> सम्पूज्या गणकः फलं च शृणुयात्तस्माच्च लाभप्रदम् ॥ 

summarizes the above said things.

Then, the *śloka,*

> शतायुर्वज्रदेहाय सर्वसम्पत्कराय च ।  
> सर्वारिष्टविनाशाय निम्बकन्दलभक्षणम् ॥ 

should be meditated upon, and the tender neem sprouts offered to God should be taken \(as *prasāda*\). Tender neem leaves and flowers should be mixed with jaggery or pepper, salt, asafoetida, cummin seeds and omam seeds and crushed. After this is consumed, other food items should be taken.

> पारिभद्रस्य पुष्पाणि कोमलानि विशेषतः ।  
> सपुष्पाणि समादाय चूर्णं कृत्वा विधानतः । 

> मरीचं लवणं हिङ्गु जीरकेण च संयुतम् ।  
> अजमोदायुतं कृत्वा भक्षयेद्रोगशान्तये ॥ \(व्रतोत्सव पुट 30\) 

The general precepts such as *Brahmacarya*, truth and composure of mind have to be observed on that day.

Thus, the discipline enjoined by the *śastras* regarding the rituals on that day have been taken note of. Let us now discuss whether these are just glorifications of blind beliefs, or the ones merely rooted in our emotions, or are really rational, or are capable of causing auspiciousness in the *ādhyātmika, ādhidaivika* and *ādibhautika* spheres or the ones which foster the achieving of the *Purushārthas*.

In all the cultured societies of the world the custom of celebrating the New Year’s Day on a particular day is prevalent. In this context, the uniqueness of the culture of our great sages, pertaining to the *viveka* in choosing the most appropriate time for the *Ugādi* festivals which is comprehensively suitable for the achievement of the *Purushārthas*, can be specially taken note of. All the aspects chosen by them such as the *Ayana*, *Ṛtu*, month, *Paksha* and *tithi* happen to be best suited entirely and beautifully for the deeds and purposes of that day.

Among the two halves of the year, viz the *Dakshiṇāyana* and *Uttarāyaṇa*, the former is the path associated with the *Pitṛs*. धूमो रात्रिस्तथा कृष्णः षन्मासा दक्षिणायनम्” But the *Uttarāyaṇa* refers to the path of the gods. “अग्निर्ज्योतिरहश्शुक्लः षण्मासा उत्तरायणम्” \(गीता 8-24\) This is also referred to as the daytime of gods. As it is enjoined that *Ugādi* is the auspicious time mainly for the worship of gods, it is indeed most appropriate that it is chosen in the *Uttarāyaṇa*, which is very conducive for the travel in the path of gods.

The *Vasanta ṛtu* \(the spring season\) in which we celebrate *Ugādi*, is the king of seasons. It is the season most dear to *devatās* and Lord *Mādhava*. It is the season when nature, adorned with colourful flowers and tender leaves, seems to send the message newsness.-“Now, my plants, trees and creepers having shed the worn out and dried leaves look brilliant with a grandeur of newness. Likewise, you shake off the old disgusting *samskāras* and tread new steps in the path of the attainment of auspicious goals of *Satya, Śiva* and *Soundarya*. Make propitious vows of auspicious wishes and auspicious resolves. They proclaim the message of morning prayer” Make your vedic hymns meaningful with the refrain” “तन्मे मनश्शिवसङ्कल्पमस्तु”. \(This is the message obtained by the sentimental persons when they experience the external beauty of Mother Nature.\) Then, a kind of tranquility is also felt in the dispositions within, and an inner attraction is experienced conducive for the realization of the *Parampurusha*, whose glory is sung by the *jnāni* poets with the hymns like “तदेव रम्यं परमनयनोत्सवकारणम्”, “अस्ति भाति प्रियम्”, “आसेचनकं अपर्याप्तामृतम्”, experiencing the beauty of supreme *Parampurusha*. Persons who surrender to this attraction happily are really the blessed and fortunate ones.

The temperate climate of the spring season is very conducive for the worship of deities and for the collection all the materials necessary for the worship. The first three seasons, viz. *Vasanta, grīshma* and *varsha*, are predominantly warm seasons. They symbolize Lord *Śiva* or *Agni*. The other three seasons *Śaradrtu, Hemantaṛtu* and *Śisiraṛtu* are predominantly cold seasons. They symbolise *Soma* or *Śakti*. The coming together of *Agni* and *Soma* \(*agnīshoma* or *Śivaśakti*\), is the cause of the creation of the world.

“अहमग्निर्महातेजाः सोमश्चैषा ममाम्बिका ।  
> अहमग्निश्च सोमश्च प्रकृत्या पुरुषः स्वयम् ॥  
> अग्नीषोमात्मकं सर्वं जगत् स्थावरजङ्गमम्”  
\(ब्रह्मपुराण 1-2-28-40 Page, 431, अनुषङ्गपाद.\) 

It is indeed appropriate to venerate that the creator chose this time of the confluence of the warmth and cold, for the creation of the universe. Creation is nothing but the external coalescence of these two forces. When the coalescence is inwards it is *Samādhi* or deep meditation. This is the opportune time which lends inspiration for the *Samādhiyoga* and also to draw out a plan for everyday life, which is in accordance with that *samādhiyoga*. When *Madhu* and *Kaiṭabha,* in the beginning of creation, stole the *Vedas* which contain the secrets of creation, the Lord incarnated himself in the form of a fish, killed the two demons, and retrieved the *Vedas* on this day, by teaching it to Lord *Brahma*. So *Caitra* is more in concordance as the festival at the beginning of the year compared to *Vaiśākha*.

Now about the month \(of the festival *ugādi*\). The lustre of *Vasanta* is seen both in *Caitra* and *Vaiśākha* months. Even so, it is justified in choosing *caitra* itself for the celebration of the beginning of the New Year, as it is the first month. And, this is the time when flowers and sprouts bloom and nectar is produced \(in them\). \(*Vaiśakha* is the month when the juice of nectar ripens\). Thus, it, is more in place to consider *Caitra* itself for the festival in preference to *Vaiśākha*.

Now, regarding the *paksha* or the fortnight. Of the two fortnights, it is the *śuklapaksha* which is more dear to the *devatās*. \(*Kṛshṇapaksha* is dear to the manes\). It is the right *paksha* for the celebration of *Ugādi*, in which the worship of Gods is prominent. Again, food is the causative factor for our birth and nourishment, and plants produce that food. This fortnight which is called *“Āpūryamāṇa”* causes the moon who is the king of plants, to wax, and is the fortnight which nourishes prosperity, happiness and robustness.

“ओषधीभ्योऽन्नम्, अन्नात्पुरुषः” “अन्नाद्भूतानि जायन्ते, जातान्यन्नेन वर्धन्ते” \(तैत्तिरीय उपनिषत्,\),

*Prathamā tithi* is also a day during which the first digit of the moon appears. Therefore it is appropriate to consider it as the first day of the year. On other days, the moon will be seen either partially or fully. Such days will either be intervening days or the last days of \(the digits of\) the moon and not the initial days.

All these are \(aspects\) regarding the observance of *Ugādi* as per the lunar calendar. Now let us dwell on the time of observance of *Sauramāna Ugādi*. The stipulated time for that in the vernal equinox. The *ayana*, the season and the month of the *Sauramāna Ugādi* happen to be same ones as that of *Candramāna Ugādi*. Over and above, the importance of the day can be explained thus-This day is called as *Saṅkramaṇa* or *Saṅkrānti*. It is the day when the sun crosses one constellation and enters the next. These *rāśis* are twelve in number. Each one of them is a knot in the tree of time. Among them the *Vishu* or *Vishuvath* is the holiest. Even among them, *Mesha Saṅkramaṇa* is considered *Mahāvishuva*.

महाविषुवमाख्यातं कृतिभिश्चित्रसंज्ञितम्

At this time of *vishuva*, even as the external sun moves on the signs of the zodiac, the internal sun \(of the *jīva*\) merges with the *sushumnā* and naturally begins to have a plunge in the *Samādhis* state. And that is why it is said that this time of confluence is best suited for *dhyāna, pūja* and *tarpaṇa*. We have to note that *Vishu* is the time when the length of the day and night should be equal.

The “confluence” and “similarity” stated above should not be construed as accidental happenings. It is the natural evenness of the unity of the inner and the outer, as per the law of nature. They should not be mistaken for mere poetic glamour symbolizing the inner merge. They are great truths, which can be experienced by sincere *Sādhakas*, when they are in a deep state of meditation. \(It may be remembered here that Śrī Raṅgamahāguru had proved through training, that this significance can be demonstrated to those who have the knowledge of Naḍī Vijnāna\) Thus, the extraordinary time stipulated by our great sages is the best suited time for meditation on the self and spiritual synthesis. This time is most suited for the worship of gods with *ādhidaivika samanvaya*. It is also the time endowed with nature’s beauty, conveniences and propriety etc. and has *ādhibhoutika samanvaya* and stands as a hand mirror to the wonderful *Kālavijnāna* of our sages, as this time is consistent with the accomplishment of all the *purushārthas* attainable in all the three spheres \(viz *Ādhyātmika, Ādhidaivika* and *Ādhibhautika*\), with the grace of god and human efforts.

### Propriety of rituals and matireals
The propriety of rituals and materials used \(for the worship\) and rituals.

Now let us discuss the importance and propriety of the materials used, and the rituals performed during *Ugādi* festival.

The objective of the festival of *Ugādi* and the rituals and the things prescribed for the festival as per *śāstra* and traditions, is the attainment of the *Purushārthas*. viz., the attainment of *Dharma, Artha, Kāma* and *Moksha*. We can note that the great sages have prescribed that certain things have to be observed which help the well being of our body, senses, mind and the intellectual power \(*Buddhi*\). They have instructed that these should not be done mechanically, but should be observed with a solemn vow along with the propitiation of gods within. When done so, our intellect delves very deep and the fruits pertaining to the three deep spheres are obtained. i.e., not just in the sphere of *adhibhūtha*, but the fruits of the other two spheres also are attained \(*Adhibhūta* refers to the external world; *adhidaiva* refers to devatas who control our inner world and *adhyātma* to the all-pervasive soul.\)

**1. Oil bath:** Taking oil bath early in the morning on that day is a must. We have noted that *śastras* prescribe only gingelly oil for that. We have also noted that a warning also is there that hell is certain for those who do not take oil bath on that day. Let us now discuss the appropriateness of the oil bath and the general and special benefits that are obtained by having it.

It is common knowledge that oil bath taken time-to-time brings us a number of physical benefits. It is said that one should have oil bath every day. This helps to get over old age, ill effects of vāta, fatigue; helps in maintaining good eye sight, composure, robustness, long life and good sleep; protects the health of the skin, brings beauty and strength to the body.

> अभ्यङ्गगमाचरेन्नित्यं स जराश्रमवातहा ।  
> दृष्टिप्रसादपुष्ट्यायुःस्वप्नसुत्वक्त्वदार्ढ्यकृत् 

says the *Āyurveda* \(This line is quoted from the work *Vāgbhaṭīya*\)

If this oil bath is taken in the prescribed manner, it helps one to maintain good health of the body and the mind. *Ugādi* is indeed a great time knot \(*parva*\). It is a powerful time which bestows special and quick results. If a person takes oil bath with a good resolve, the results shall be more powerful in addition to the strength of the mind. The state of the body and mind gets clean and hale, congenial to the observance of the rituals of that day. It is natural that a person who experiences the benefits of that treatment gets inspired to enjoy it time and again. Thus, this augurs well to become a joyous beginning for the “vow of health,”

This is the material aspect of it. Over and above this, the resultant relaxation and the gladdening of the senses fecilitate the attainment of a state of complete happiness which the *yogis* call *‘dhātusāmya’*. It is the ultimate state needed for the meditation upon the *sāttvika devatās*, and the superior most and omniscient God \(“धातुप्रसादान्महिमानमीशं”, कठ.. उ.-2-20\) And no need to mention again that the oil bath taken as prescribed, helps to reach that state, and abounds in greatness. Therefore, oil bath should not be given up deeming it a carnal pleasure. Students of meditation should have massaging done and should take the oil bath suitably. It may be remembered here that experts say it should be rightly understood that, this oil bath is not something which just provides bodily pleasure, but an integral part of *Yoga* practice as well

**2. Decoration of the house:** We have noted how the *pūja* room and the house should be decorated specially with festoons, flags and *rangavalli* etc., The decoration is a feast to the eyes and makes the mind fresh. In this regard ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru had said-“This beautification should not just end being a feast to our eyes. It should be radiant with the beauty of an art work and materials, which elevate one to the divine state that causes spiritual delight. Otherwise this Alankāra \(decoration\) may attract a remark viz Alam Kāra\* \(Enough of this tiresome work\).

The flag hoisted high on that day, should have symbols in tune with spirituality. It should be pleasing and auspicious, and it should be the *Vaijayantī* \(victory\) banner of *Dharma*, which reminds us of the acts of the Lord like the destroying of the evil forces. **At this point we remember the holy message of our *Guru*-“That flag with its holy message should indeed touch the pinnacle lotus feet of the Lord.”** The person who hoists the flag should conduct himself in the path of *Dharma*. If not, he comes to be called ‘*dharmadhvaja*’ \(The one who flaunts the features of a *Dharmanishṭha* though he possesses no faith in *Dharma*.\) न लिङ्गम् धर्मकारणम्-Mere external religious marks or signs cannot render a person religious in the real sense. It will be a great sin if a person doesn’t act accordingly, in spite of knowing the facts.

“To be mistaken is a misfortune to be pitied. But to know the fact and not to conform to it is a mistake which heaven and earth condemn.”

**Vow:** The ordainment that a solemn vow should be taken on that day with the words. ‘I am going to observe *Ugādi*’, sounds very meaningful. In this vow, at the outset, the Lord who is beyond space and time, is remembered with the words “*Harih aum tatsat*”, Then, the time and place of performing the fesitival and its purpose will be brought to our minds. This helps one to remember that though God is beyond time and place, the \(present\) place and time are his very body. The glory of the particular parts of that body will also be remembered. The goals of the ritual taken up \(on that day\) also get firmly rooted in memory. By all this, the ritual itself becomes powerful in the real sense of the word. यदेव विद्यया करोति वीर्यवत्तरं Any act done without this realization may become weak, futile, or sometimes may prove dangerous also. A person who desires to fell fruits from a tree should know the distance between himself and the fruit and the tree, the stone he is going to throw, and the speed at which it should fly and the force he has to use to throw the stone. There is no need to describe how dangerous and useless it will be, if a blind person simply keeps on throwing stones.

A ritual done without the desire for the fruit and done with the vow “This is for the love of God and in the form of service to Him” is no doubt excellent. It is fine even if it is done with a good intentioned vow, and with a desire which is not opposed to the love of god. This does not result in any kind of harm to *Dharma*. Because, a desire, not going against *Dharma*, is indeed auspicious and a form of God himself.

“धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ”

If *darbhas, akshatās* and *gandha* are held in the hand at the time of making a solemn vow, repugnant *samskāras* get warded off and they \(the auspicious things\) pave way for the free flow of the contemplated objectives.

**3. Worship of God:** It is a *nityakarma* to worship God everyday. And it is very appropriately prescribed that Lord *Brahma* and the *Kālapurusha* \(Lord of time\) who is like the body of *Brahma*, should be worshipped on that day along with the *Ishṭadevatā*. We celebrate the festival with a just inquiry, which is in accordance with the words “This is the day of the beginning of *Satyayuga*.” Therefore it is very appropriate to worship God in the form of the very first creator, on that day. A *Samvatsara* is a special form of reckoning of time. Therefore, it is equally appropriate to worship *Kālapurusha* on the beginning day. So, it is very appropriate to worship *Prajāpati* and *Kālapurusha* together. This is because, the *Kālapurusha* is an extension of *Prajāpati* and his very glory, and another form of the Lord himself. The custom of worshipping *Prajāpati* as *Kālapurusha* has been in vogue in our country since ages. Because the *Vedas* declare-“*Samvatsara* is the image of *Prajāpati. Prajāpati* is *Samvatsara* itself.”

स ऎक्षत प्रजापतिः इमां वात्मनः प्रतिमाम्  
असृक्षीयत संवत्सरमिति, तस्मादाहुः प्रजापतिः संवत्सर इति  
\(शत, 11-1-61\) 

स्वयंभूः प्रजापतिः संवत्सर इति संवत्सरः  
असावादित्यो य एष पुरुषः ।। \(तै.उ. 4-29-14\) 

Thus it is very proper to worship *Prajāpati* and his glory, and pray to to him with the words “O Lord, grant me the strength to understand the nodes of Time and to achieve *Dharma, Artha* and *Kāma* with that knowledge and also to utilize \(that knowledge\) in the great task of the crossing of Time itself.” It is stated in the chapter of *samvatsarapratipādā of Vratārka* as follows:-

“There was no measure of time before this point. \(On this day Lord *Prajāpati* called a meeting of all the *devatās* and blessed them with \(the knowledge of\) planets, months and seasons\) From that point down to this day, we have been following of *dharma* in our tradition.

“ततःप्रभृति पूर्वतरैः यो धर्मः पूर्वैः कृतः अद्यापि रूढः सुतरां स कर्तव्यः प्रयत्नतः”-So, There is no need in particular to describe the great importance and usefulness of this prayer on this special occasion.

**5. *Homa:*** A heartfelt prayer should be offered in the beginning of the worship. Afterwards, God should be invoked and worshipped in idols, water and sacrifical fire, in keeping with one’s ability, as this \(worship\) is also an extention of *antaraṅga pūja* itself.

> स्थण्डिले प्रतिमायां वा वह्नौ वा हृदयेऽपि वा । \(स्मृति सं. I-198\) 

> भगवन् पुण्डरीकाक्ष हृद्यागं तु मया कृतम् ।  
> आत्मसात्कुरु देवेश बाह्ये त्वां सम्यगर्चये ॥ \(सात्वत आराधनकल्प\) 

Among these, the holy fire is the most suitable medium for performing *pūja* externally. This is because *Agni* is his effulgent body, He is His form of radiance, His reflection, His image, His representative et al. God should be invoked in that. *Ājya, caru* etc have be offered in that, and through that, the worship of God as a *Yajnarūpi* should be accomplished.

“अग्नौ समिद्धार्चिषि सप्ततन्तोरातस्थिवान्मन्त्रमयं शरीरम्” \(“O Lord you take the *mantramaya* body in the sacrificial fire burning in the *samits*.\) “अग्नौ क्रियावतां देवः” God appears to the performer in the \(sacrificial\) fire. Meditation of God is *Antaryoga*. If the *Bahiryoga* is combined with that, then it will be a *yoga* par excellence

“अन्तर्योगं बहिर्योगं यो जानाति विशेषतः । त्वया मयाप्यसौ वन्द्यः शेषैर्वन्द्यस्तु किं पुनः” ॥ \(घेरण्डसंहिता\)

It is indeed very appropriate that, in the *Ugādi* festival, *Agni* the medium of worship is called *“Yavishṭha”.* Because *‘Yavishṭha’ \(Atiśāyena tamabishṭhanau\)* means the youngest. At the beginning of creation, *Śakti* was worshipped as something very minute. *Agni*, who symbolizes power, is considered as the youngest and so this usage is indeed appropriate. Later in the process of evolution, at its zenith, *Agni* should be considered as *Jyeshṭha*.

**5. Listening to the Pañchaṅga:** *Tithi, vāra, nakshatra, yoga* and *Karaṇa* are considered the five constituents of the *Kālakosha*. Our everyday *Karmas* should be performed with a clear knowledge of these five. And that too, worshipping the *Kālapurusha* on that day, obtaining his favour, listening to the \(reading\) of the 5 *aṅgas,* and the observance of the auspicious beginning through them, are indeed powerful religious acts. Listening not just to the 5 *aṅgas* of that day, but to the general *yoga* of the planets, stars etc of the whole year, helps to plan the activities of the entire year. In addition to this, offering of suitable remuneration to the *daivajna* with gratitude, who judiciously reads out the *Pañcāṅga*, makes the worship virtuous.

**6. *Dāna:*** To offer alms in one’s capacity in all the nodes of Time is a meritorious act. It is specially laid down to offer a gift of *Pañcāṅga,* water pot and clothes and ornaments in addition to the general *Annadāna*, on the day of *Ugādi*. The offering of the *Pañcāṅga* cited earlier, is indeed a part of worship. As it is the beginning of summer, all acts such as offering of *Jalapātra,* distribution of drinking water, butter milk and *pānaka* by setting up *aravattiges* etc. are virtually a tradition suiting the \(warm\) season.

While offering clothes, one must have the heartfelt feeling that it is the gift of *Devendra* to *Vasubhūpati*. This gift has to be given with divine feelings. And the one who receives it must also have the same feeling.

“विष्णुर्दाता विष्णुर्द्रव्यं प्रतिगृहणामि वै वदेत्” \(अग्नि पु. 289-50\) “\(The giver of the *dāna* is none other than *Vishṇu* and the thing given is also *Vishṇu*. And I receive it with this feeling.”\) If the “give and take” is done this way, the giver obtains *Puṇyapurushārtha* and no harm touches the receiver also.

**8. Special *Naivedya***: The special *Naivedya* to be offered to God and later to be taken by the devotee on the day of *Ugādi* is the \(mixture of\) neem, neem flowers and tender neem. A festival is an occasion to eat sweets and to be happy. Then, why indeed our ancestors have prescribed bitter neem as a “*Ugādi* special?” Was it to provide a change for the tongue which gets dull because of eating sweet dishes in other festivals? Such ideas may occur only to those who think that one of the important motives of life is the gratification of the tongue. But when viewed scientifically, it becomes clear that this *naivedya* taken on that day will bring in great benefits, in the *ādhibhautika, ādhidaivika* and the *ādhyātmika* spheres.

Neem has a great medicinal value in curing bone related ailments and toxic infection. If it is consumed while \(chanting and\) recalling the spirit of the words “शतायुर्वज्रदेहाय”, the \(effective\) combination of the will power and the power of the medicine will yield quick results. There is also a practice of consuming the paste prepared by crushing neem with jaggery. This is also a good combination. Because, the bitter neem contains *vātadosha.* “कटुतिक्तकषाया वातं जनयन्ति” \(चरक, 1-7\) And sweet jaggery taken with neem removes the bad effect of *vāta*. *Caraka* says मधुराम्ललवणास्त्वेनं शमयन्ति” \(चरक 17\) The sweetness in jaggery reduces the bitterness of the neem and renders it easily palatable. This is an added benefit.

The combination of neem and jaggery, just as it is beneficial to the body, can be effective when taken sentimentally also. It reminds the ideal of the resolute *yogi* who leads a sober life, taking evenly both happiness and misery.

“सुखदुःखे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ” \(गीता 2-38\)

This is an essential lesson, not just for a *yogi*, but for all laymen. This shall provide an inspiration to gather evenness, not only on the day it is consumed, but for the whole year, or for that matter, the whole life.

*“Jeevanavellā bevu bella*  
*Aritu bāluvane kaligala malla”* 

\(The whole life is but a mixture of happiness and sorrow.

The one who leads a life with this understanding is indeed a strong man\)

There is a practice of mixing neem with sugar candy also. Though sugar removes *vāta*, the sweet content in that increases phlegm.

In order to reduce that effect, adding of astringent pepper to it is also in vogue. This combination removes all the three-fold *doshas* namely *Vāta, pitta* and *kapha* and acts as a general remedy for all diseases. Sometimes, salt is added instead of sugar. Though salt gets rid of *vāta*, it causes phlegm. But pepper takes out that phlegm. And if cummin seeds and *omakki* \(lingusticum ajwaen\) are added, the combination has the properties of removing *Ushṇa*, *Pitta* etc. All these are effects on the body.

At the same time, one should observe that there is a unique divine reason for prescribing the above mentioned paste of tender leaves of neem as *naivedya* to God. This paste is dear to the principal deity of the *Ugādi* festival. Just as *modaka* is very dear to *Gaṇapati* and dishes of bengalgram are very dear to *Hayagrīva*, the combination of neem and neem sprout etc. is very dear to *Prajāpati kālapurusha*, the reigning deity of *Ugādi*. It should not be surmised in the general sense that God literally consumes these and he also harbours greediness \(to eat\). On the other hand, it should be taken in the sense that the spiritual centers in the body congenial to the propitiousness and perception of that God to whom the *naivedya* is offered, can get opened up, if this *prasāda* is consumed.

Thus, all the things and rituals prescribed by *jnānis* for the *Ugādi* festival are full of meaning. We can note that they pervade all the areas of life and bestow upon the worshipper, *puṇya, purushārtha* and *paramārthas*.

### FAQ 
A few important questions, answers and summation.

A few questions that come up regarding the observation of this *Ugādi* will be answered now and the discussion will be concluded on this topic herewith.

Some of the questions relate to the time of observing this festival. The rest relate to the materials used, and the *vidhis*. All these questions require to be answered rationally.

The first of these questions pertain to the time prescribed for this *parva*, which is being celebrated as per *Sauramāna* or the *Cāndramāna* calendars. The discussion on this topic is very important as it is pertinent not just to *Ugādi* but to all the prescribed rituals.

*Sauramāna* refers to the reckoning of time based on \(the “movement” of\) the sun. The time during which the sun \(relatively\) moves from one constellation to the other in the zodiac, is called *Saṅkramaṇa* or *sankrānti*. The time interval between two consecutive *saṅkrāntis* is one month. Twelve such months make a year. These twelve months have 365 days in all.

The *Cāndramāna* system refers to the movement of the moon. The day on which he “disappears” in the sky, is a newmoon day. The time span between two new moon days is one month. Usually one year comprises of 12 such months. During some years, an “extra month” \(*adhikamāsa*\) is also counted.

> दर्शाद्दर्शस्तु चान्द्रः स्यात् त्रिंशाहश्चैव सावनः ।  
> मासः सौरस्तु सङ्क्रान्तेः नाक्षत्रो भानुवर्तनात् । 

\(In the Cādramāna system, the period of time from the first day of the *Śuklapaksha* to the next new moon day is considered *Amāntamāsa* and the period of time from the first day of the *Kṛshṇapaksha* to the next full moon day is called *Pūrṇimānta māsa*. The word *Sāvana* refers to a sacrifice or a yajna. According to this system a month has 30 days and the year has 360 days. Only in astronomical and astrological calculations, the *Nākshatra* and *Bārhaspatyamānas* will be of more use. *agnipurāṇa* 13-30\)

The *Sauramāna* system is more in vogue as *Deśācāra* in TamilNadu, *Dakshiṇa Kannada*, Bengal, Punjab, Nepal and some other places. And in Karnataka and Andhra and in some other places, *cāndramāna* system is more in use as *Deshācāra*.

Which of the two systems is credible? If both are credible, which is superior of the two? Which tradition can be best for celebrating *Ugādi*? These questions arise naturally and our answers are as follows:-

Both the systems are authentic as they are based on scientific calculations.

Since both the systems are authentic, as they are based on scientific calculations, both are equally recognized throughout the country. For example, both *sauramāna saṅkranti* and *Cāndramāna amāvāsya* are observed by all people belonging to the *Sanāthana Ārya Bhārata* traditions and culture throughout the country. So far as rituals are concerned, it is better to follow the custom of the region. Not just because it is the custom of the region, but the inner and outer nature effected by factors such as climate, latitude and longitude of that region, and the food habits there are to be considered here. If a *parva* is celebrtated by people accustomed to the region where a particular is ‘*māna*’ prevalent, a unique effect is produced. This can be understood by those who can examine the matter minutely.

It is a general rule that people who have migrated and settled in a new place for a period of twelve years \(or more\), should follow the customs of the new place. But it may become necessary to adapt some changes with respect to *upāsana* and relevant rituals. Actually, the *Śastras* say that separate *mānas* are ideal for different religious rites. Statements such as “*Cāndramāna* is ideal for *vratas*. The *sauramāna* is ideal for *smārtakarma* and marriage etc. The *sāvanamāsa* is ideal for fire sacrifices and disbursing salary. The *nākshatramāna* is ideal for *abhisheka*” can be seen in them. “व्रते चान्द्रमसं शस्तम्” “सौरं स्मार्तेष्वनिन्दितम्” “विवाहादौ स्मृतः सौरः यज्ञादौ सावनः स्मृतः । अभिषेके तु नाक्षत्रं सावनं वेतनादिषु” \(स्मृ.चं. ५\)

The custom of following *cāndramāna* for *pitṛāryas* is also in vogue. Following of the *Sauramāna* system is also there. \(*śastras*\) support both the above *mānas*.

आब्दिके पितृकार्ये च चान्द्रो मासः प्रशस्यते । \(अग्नि 173-3\)

पित्र्ये चान्द्रमसं शस्तं” “व्रते चान्द्रमसं शस्तं न श्राद्धेषु कदाचन ॥  
\(स्मृ. सं. 5\) 

\(It is in place to remember the accomplished words of the Mahāguru who said “The cāndramāna which indicates pitryanamārga \(moon’s path\) is ideal for performing pitṛkarmas like the śrāddha. The Sauramāna which indicates the devayanamārga \(the path of the sun\) is ideal for marriage etc., where the worship of gods is primary.”\)

As both the worship of gods and *pitṛs* is performed on *Ugādi*, both the *mānas* are ideal for that.

2. Presently, *Ugādi* is being celebrated according to both *Sauramāna* and *cāndramāna* in the *Vasantha Ṛtu*. There are several reasons also possible to guess that the new year was being celebrated in the past, in various seasons in our country.

In Sanskrit, there are two synonyms for the word “year”, viz *varsha* and *śarat*. It is possible that, in different parts of the country, the new year was being celebrated on some specific days during *varshaṛtu* and *śaradṛtu*. Further, both *Kātyāyanasmṛti* and *Amarakosha* very clearly state that the first day of the New Year falls in the *mārgaśira māsa*.

The word *‘āgrahāyana’* which refers to the month of *mārgaśīrsha* also substantiates the point. “आदाय मार्गशीर्षादि द्वै द्वै मासौ ॠतुर्मतः” “मार्गादीनां युगैः क्रमात्” \(अग्रे हायनं यस्य the one which has the year in its front\). So, why should *Ugādi* be celebrated in *vasantaṛtu* only, some may ask. This can be clarified as follows:

In the discussion pertaining to the appropriate time for the celebration of *Ugādi*, it has been expounded earlier that the *vasantaṛtu* is ideal for that. But it should not be misconstrued that it is unscientific to begin the year in the *Varshaṛtu, sharadṛtu* or the *mārgaśīramāsa*. Even now, they can be called *‘Vidyāvatsarārambha*, so far as the study of certain *vidyās* are concerned. We see the seeds sprouting in *Varsha ṛtu*. The *upākarma*, i.e, the initiation to the study of the *Vedas* which contain the knowledge of God’s creation, is generally performed in that season only. The climate in the *śaradṛtu*, which is free from rains or clouds, is very ideal for the beginning of the study of *kshatravidyā* \(military science\) and also for the military expedition by the trained.

“यात्रायै चोदयामास तं शक्तेः प्रथमं शरत्” \(रधुवंश-४\) This is the right time for *sanyāsis* also to begin their spiritual conquest. The greatness of *Mārgaśīrsha* is eulogized by the Lord himself in the *Bhagavad Gīta* -“मासानां मार्गशीर्षेऽहम्” This is the time when plants and trees stoop with ripe fruits. Cows yield milk in plenty during this season. It is the time of *Navāgrayaṇa Pūja*, and the most suited time to begin the study of *Purāṇas* and history.

In this way, every season in the year is significant in one way or the other. And, it does not need to be explained again that the spring season is most appropriate for the celebration of *Ugādi*, as it fosters all meritorious deeds.

3. *Vishu*: *Vishu* means a period of time when both the day and night are of equal duration. “समरात्रं दिने काले विषुवद्विषुवं च तत्”

Such a time occurs twice a year-on the 23rd of September and on the 21st of March. This conforms to the modern scientific almanac also. But traditionally, *Tulā Saṅkramaṇa Vishu* is observed on the 18th of October and *Citravishu Ugādi*, on the 14th April, or a day in its proximity. A question naturally crops up as to which is right. Here, there is no need to quarrel prejudicially over the rightness of the traditional almanac or the modern almanac. *“Pañcāṅga hodare nakshatra hoyite”* \(Do the stars perish if the almanc is lost\) is an adage in Kannada which hints that it is wise to observe the accurate positions of the planets and stars and incorporate corrections wherever necessary. In this context we respectfully remember the words of our Mahāguru, who had stated “Now and then, some changes take place in the stellar bodies. Once in sixty years, the Śankusthāpana has to be done in a proper place and after noting the changes, calculations in our almanacs need to be corrected as necessary. But such duty of recognising has stopped for hundreds of years in our country. The responsibility to revive it and to correct the variations that may have occurred in our calculation is upon us.”\)

B\) 1\) The next set of questions relate to the things needed for the worship and the modalities. Some people may not be able to afford to perform in detail the rituals viz *dāna, homa* and *pūja* etc. enjoined by the *Śāstras* and traditions pertaining to this festival. Some many not have sufficient time. How should such people observe the festival? Can they make some changes in that? \(We wish to say that\) they have to understand clearly the significance of the festival. The central point of the festival is the worship of *prajāpati* or *Kālapurusha* and preparing a good plan for the religious acts to be performed for the entire year. This has to be done invariably. Those who do not have the means to celebrate the festivals in the way prescribed by traditions, may accomplish them by *dhyāna* itself. They can offer God a thing called the mind filled with *bhakti, śraddha* and *viveka* and attain the *paramārtha*.

This is touchingly brought out in a dialogue between *Janaka* and *Yājnavalkya* in the *Shathapatha Brāhmaṇa* \(XI-3-1\), King *Janaka* asks the sage-How do you perform *agnihotra* when either milk or cereals are not avaialable?” The sage answers saying, “using wild fruits and roots”. Then *Janaka* asks “In case they are also not availale.”? “Using water” replies the sage. The king further asks, “If you do not get even water, how will your perform *agnihotra*?” “By \(using\) the truth of *śraddhā* only.” This was the reply of the *Yogirāja*, borne out of his adherence to truth and own experience. A quotation from the scriptures may be remembered here “यं यं क्रतुमधीते तेन तेनास्येष्टं भवति” \(तै. आर. II\) \(Even by the mere study of the hymns the fruits of the of the *yajna* are obtained\)

But those who can afford should observe these festivals as prescribed in the *śāstras* without any kind of miserliness, and should perform *dāna*, *dharma, homa* etc. with suitable things. “वित्तशाठ्यं न कुर्वित”

As the worship, *dāna, homa* etc. prescribed for this festival are *Kāmya karmas,* can true devotees of god also perform them?-some many entertain such a doubt. Our reply for this is, let the *Paramaikāntis* and *paramahamsas* perform the rituals only for the pleasure of God. But nothing wrong, there is the rest of the people to perform them for the fulfillment of desires also, if they \(the desires\) are not opposed of *Dharma*.

“धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ” \(गीता XI-II\)

With these discussions, we would like to conclude this chapter, acquainting the readers with the details of the celebration of *Ugādi*. While giving a general description of *Bhāratiya* festivals, it was declared that their features, names, time and the things used and the ways and methods of performing them are all full of significance, extensive, full of *jnāna* and *vijnāna*, and an abode of *purushārthas* and *paramārthas*. While making a study of \(the discussion pertaining to\) *Ugādi*, a major festival which can be observed by all, and which comes in the very beginning of the year, the discriminating readers should judge after testing them on the touch stone of logic, whether the above features are in tune with that and whether the synthesis is beautiful and satisfactory. Our *trikaraṇapūrvaka namaskāras* to those great men who churn out the truth, without either bias or attachment, and who experience the truth for themselves and vouchsafe it for the welfare of mankind.





	 
## Upākarma

*Upākarma* is one of the most important *parvas* which is observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*. This is a very important *parva* which is observed all over India. The people of North India say—“Four very important *parvas* are observed in our country. They are *sravanī-Upākarma*, *daśaharā* \(*Navarātra, Vijayadaśamī*,\) *dīvālī* \(*dīpāvalī*\) and *Holī*. Though these four are important for all, they are especially important to brahmins, *Kshatriyas, Vaishyas* and *śūdras* respectively”. *Karmas* are of three types. They are *kāmya, nitya* and *naimittika. Kāmya karmas* are the ones which are performed only if there is a desire for something; otherwise they need not be performed. *Nitya karmas* are obligatory deeds which have to be performed every day. And the *Naimittika Karmas* are the ones which should be performed compulsorily on some particular days which are significant because of the *Tithi*, star and the planetary position of the day etc. *Upākarma* belongs to the third category. It is a *parva karma* which should performed every year on a particular day. It is a commendable auspicious *karma* related to the study of the *vedas*. Some *Maharshis* consider this as one of the eighteen *Mahāsamskāras*.

		
### Names
Names of Upākarma and the reason for using the term

This *parva* is called by many names in *Śāstras* such as *Upākarma*, *adhyāyopākarma, upākaraṇa, vedasvīkāra, vedārambhaṇa* etc., In North India it is known by the name *‘Śrāvaṇī’*, in Tamilnadu, it is called *‘Āvaṇi avittam’* In Karnataka it is called by the scriptural name *‘Upākarma’* by people who are knowledgeable in traditions. Common people call it *‘janivārada habba.’*

As it is a sacrament of initiation for the study of *vedas* and their comprehension, the names *Upākarma*, *adhyāyopākarma, upākaraṇa, vedasvīkāra*, and *vedārambhaṇa* suit the *parva*. \(उपाक्रियते अनेन इति उपाकरणं. उप \+ आ \+ कृ \+ मनिन्\) The name *Śrāvaṇī* also suits it as it is an important festival in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*. As this is a festival which is observed by *Yajurvedis* on the day when the star *Śravishṭhā* occurs in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, tamils call it *‘Āvaṇi-Avittam’* As the wearing of a new sacred thread \(*janivāra*\) is noticed by all, the custom of calling it. *‘janivārada habba’* by common people is in vogue.

### *Adhikāris* 
\(Rightful claimants\) for *Upākarma* and rules of time for the observance

This is a *parva* which should be observed by men who belong to all *Vedaśākhās* \(branches of the *vedas*\). All those who have undergone *upanayana samskāra* are qualified to observe this. Even those who are not qualified for *upanayana*, should worship God in a special way and meditate upon him on this day, which is dear to the *Veda Purusha* \(The God of the *Vedas*\).

Some people think that *Upākarma* is important only to *Brahmacāris* and not of much importance to others. But *Dharmaśāstras* state that *Upākarma* observance is intended for all the three i.e. *Brahmacāris*, *gṛhastha*s and *Vānaprasthas*.

> अधीयीत गृहस्थोऽपि नियमाद्ब्रह्मचारिवत् \(व्यासस्मृति\) 

> उपाकर्म तथोत्सर्गं वनस्थानामपीष्यते,  
> धारणाध्ययनं कृत्वा गृहिणां ब्रह्मचारिणाम् \(देवलस्मृति\) 

*Upākarma* should not be performed in the year of the passing away of one’s father or mother. This *vrata* should not be observed in *jātāśauca* \(impurity caused by the birth of a child in the family\) or *mṛtāśauca* \(impurity because of a death in the family\). It is not auspicious to observe *Upākarma* in *malamāsa* \(intercalary month\) But some people say that *Upākarma* can be observed after performing *Śāntikarma* \(expiatory or propitiatory rites\). But the first *Upākarma* \(*pratamopākarma*\) should never be done in *Malamāsa*.

*Bṛhaspati, Śukra*, *Maṅgala* and *Budha* \(Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Mercury\) are the *adhidevatās* \(presiding deities\) for *Ṛgveda*, *Yajurveda, Sāmaveda* and *Atharvaveda* respectively. It is auspicious for the followers of respective *shākhās* to observe this *vrata* on those days when the power of the respective *grahas* is strong.

> ऋग्यजुस्सामअथर्वेशा जीवशुक्रकुजेन्दुजाः ।  
> शाखाधीशे शक्तियुक्ते तच्छाखाध्ययनं शुभम् ॥  
> गुरुर्भृगुसुतो धात्रीपुत्रः शशधरात्मजः ।  
> स्युरेते ऋग्यजुस्सामाथर्वणाधिपाः स्मृताः ॥ 

Sages state that the months of *Śrāvaṇa*, *Bhādrapada* or *Āshāḍha,* and the *tithīs Pūrṇima* and *Pañcamī*, and the stars *Śravaṇa* and *Hasta* are best suited for the observance of *Upākarma*. But different *Sūtrakāras* \(Authors of religious manuals\) have stated either different months, *tithis* and *Nakshatrās*, or the same month, *tithi* and *Nakshatrās* among these. It is best for people who belong to different *śākhas* to observe the *vrata* according to the words of their *Sūtrakāras*.

Manu has stated that *Upākarma* should be observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*.

श्रावण्यां प्रोष्ठपद्यां वाप्युपाकृत्य यथाविधि। युक्तश्छन्दांस्यधीयीत ।

Of the two months \(*Śrāvaṇa, Bhādrapada*\), *Śrāvaṇa* is generally considered suitable for *Ṛgvedis* and *Yajurvedis*, and *Bhādrapada* is considered suitable for *Sāmavedis* for *Upākarma*.

*Āpastamba* is of the opinion that *Upākarma* should be observed on the day of *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima*.

श्रावण्यां पौर्णमास्यां अध्यायं उपाकृत्य

He opines that it is desirable to observe *Upākarma* on the *Pūrṇima* of *Bhādrapada*, if any blemish or inconveience is encountered in *Śrāvaṇa*. But it is important that it is observed in *Pūrṇimā tithi*.

*Āshvalāyana* states that *Upākarma* should be observed either on the day of *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, or in *Hastā Nakshatra* occuring with *Pañcamī tithi*.

> अथाथोऽध्यायानामुपाकरणं ओषधीनां प्रादुर्भावे  
> श्रवणेन श्रावण्यां पाञ्चम्यां हस्तेन वा। 

According to *Yājnavalkya*, *Upākarma* should be observed on *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima* with *Śrāvaṇa Nakshatra* or on *Pañcamī* with *Hasta Nakshatra*.

> अध्यायानामुपाकर्म श्रावण्याम् श्रवणेन वा।  
> हस्तेनौषधिभावे वा पाञ्चम्यां श्रावणस्य तु ॥ 

*Bodhāyana* says that *Upākarma* should be observed either on *Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima* or on *āshādha Pūrṇima*.

श्रावण्यां पूर्णमास्यां आषाढ्यां वोपाकृत्य माध्यां वा उत्सृजेत् ॥

According to sage *Gautama, Upākarma* should be observed either in the month of *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*.

श्रावणीं वार्षिकीं प्रौष्ठपदीं वोपाकृत्य

*Vasishṭha smṛti* also gives the same opinion. This *smṛti* states that *Pūrṇimā* is a must for *Upākarma*.

अथातः स्वाध्यायोपाकर्म श्रावण्यां पूर्णमास्यां प्रौष्ठपद्यां वा॥

We have to note an important matter here. The time when medicinal plants start sprouting is the most auspicious time for observing *Upākarma*.

“ओषधीनां प्राद्रुर्भावे”  
“तद्वार्षिकमित्याचक्षते” 

Sages say “ऒषधिप्रादुर्भावे”. If the medicinal plants fail to sprout in *Śrāvaṇa*, *Upākarma* should be performed in *Bhādrapada* when the medicinal plants sprout.

Those who state that *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* is most important for *Upākarma* should note an important point. “If *Śrāvaṇa nakshatra* does not pervade for the whole day and if it is conjoined with *uttarāshāḍhā*, *Upākarma* should not be observed on that day. And,if star *Śravaṇa* is conjoined with *Dhanishṭhā*, *Upākarma* should be observed on that day”— says the *Vyāsasmrtī*.

> श्रवणेन तु यत्कर्म उत्तराषाढसंयुतम् ।  
> संवत्सरकृतोऽध्यायः तत्क्षणादेव नश्यति ॥  
> धनिष्ठासंयुतं कुर्यात् श्रावणे कर्म यद्भवेत् ।  
> तत्कर्म सफलं विद्यादुपाकरणसंज्ञितम् ॥ 

According to *Āpastamba, Upākarma* should be observed on *Pūrṇima* of *Bhādrapada* or *Āshāḍha*, if any *āsouca* occurs in *Śrāvaṇa,* or if it is a *Malamāsa*, or if any blemishes, eclipse, *Saṅkramaṇa* or the setting of the planets *Guru* and *Śukra* happen to occur in *Śrāvaṇa*. If there are any demerits or stains in all these three months, *Upākarma* should be observed in the month of *Śrāvaṇa*, according to *Vasishṭhasmṛti* and *Vyāsasmṛti*.

मासत्रयेपि दोषश्चेत् श्रावण्यामेव कारयेत्

When all the three months have some *doshas* \(blemishes\), *Upākarma* should be observed in *Śrāvaṇa* itself, after performing *śānthi karmas* with the *mantras* prescribed for *gṛahayajna*.

Now we have to evaluate one or two matters alluded to earlier.

The first is whether *Upākarma* is *nityakarma* or *naimittika karma*. “*Nityakarma* is one which has to be performed everyday” is one definition. In that sense, *Upākarma* is not a *nityakarma*. \(Because\) It is performed only on a specified day in a year. But *nityakarma* would mean duties which should be done regularly as per rules every day. “It is a *karma* that should be necessarily observed on time according to precepts. If not, it causes a demerit \(called\) *pratyavāya*”-This is another definition of *Nityakarma*. From this point of view, *Upākarma* becomes a *Nityakarma* only. The analysis provided by *Mārkandeya Purāṇa* in this regard may be noted here.

> नित्यं नैमित्तिकं चैव नित्यनैमित्तिकं तथा ।  
> गृहस्थस्य त्रिधा कर्म तन्निशामय पुत्रक ॥ 

> पाञ्चयज्ञाश्रितं नित्यं यदेतत्कथितं तव।  
> नैमित्तिकं तथा चान्यत् पुत्रजन्मक्रियादिकम् ॥  
> नित्यं नैमित्तिकं ज्ञेयं पर्वश्राद्धादि पण्डितैः । 

\(A *gṛhastha* \(householder\) must necessarily perform three duties namely *nitya, naimittika* and *nityanaimittika karmas*. *Nityakarmas* are those which are performed based on the *pañcamahāyajnas*. When a male child is born in the family, *Jātakarma* \(A ceremony at the birth of a child\) is to be done. For this reason it comes under *naimittika karma. Karmas* such as performing a *śrāddha* to please the *pitṛs* which are performed on specific *parvas* come under *nityanaimittika karmas*. It comes under *Naimittika* as it is performed due to the death of a relative. It also comes under *nityakarma* as it is enjoined on every *parva* such as *amāvāsya*, *saṅkramaṇa* and *grahaṇa*. From this point of view, *Upākarma* is also a *Nityakarma* as it has to be observed by all the *dvijas* \(twice born\), on the day of the occurrence of *Śrāvaṇa \(Bhādrapada Āshāḍha\), Pūrṇima, Śravaṇanakshatra, Hastanakshatra* etc., as per precepts.

The second matter: On what days *Upākarma* is prohibited? The *Śāstras* say that it should not be performed on those days which have blemishes such as *Āsauca, Malamāsa*, eclipse, non-appearance of *guru* or *śukra* etc. And, it should be observed on a day which is free from these blemishes.

		
> मलमासे निपतिते सूतके मृतकेऽपि वा ।  
> ग्रहणे सङ्क्रमे वोपि मौढ्ये च गुरुशुक्रयोः ॥  
> प्रौष्ठपद्यामथाषाढ्यामुपाकरणमिष्यते  
\(वसिष्ठस्मृति, वैद्यनाथीय वर्णाश्रमाचारकाण्ड\) 

> प्रायश्चित्तं तु सर्वस्य मलमासे विवर्जयेत् ।  
> उपाकर्मोत्सर्जनं च पवित्रदमनार्पणम्॥ 

“In spite of all these, *Upākarma* is a *nityakarma* like *sandhyāvandana*. Therefore it should be observed even if it comes in a *malamāsa*. Only the *prathama Upākarma* should not be done in *malamāsa*. Instead, it should be done in *śuddhamāsa*.” — With this explanation some perform the yearly *Upākarma* even if it occurs in a *malamāsa*. Which of these two opinions is right? When there is a provision, it is best to perform it in a month other than a *malamāsa*. If another auspicious day is not available, only then it should be done in *malamāsa*.

> सावकाशं तु यत्कर्म न कुर्यान्मासि दूषिते ।  
> कुर्यान्निरवकाशं तु नित्यं नैमित्तिकं तथा॥ 

Third question: Can *Upākarma* be performed in the year of the death of any of the parents when the *ābdikas* are yet to be completed?

*Śāstras* say—“The body of the *Karta* \(the one who has performed the obsequies of the parents\) is said to be impure till the year end rites are completed. So, excepting the *māsikas* \(monthly rites\) no other *karmas* such as *pitṛkarmas* or *devatākarmas* should be performed.”

> प्रमीतौ पितरौ यस्य देहस्तस्याशुचिर्भवेत् ।  
> न दैवं नापि पित्र्यं वा यावत्पूर्णो न वत्सरः ॥ \(धर्मसिन्धु page 964\) 

As *Upākarma* is both a *daiva* \(divine\) and an *Ārshakarma* \(pertaining to the sages\), it should not be performed according to the above statement, in the year of death of father or mother. Also, *Hemādrismṛtimīmāmsā* clearly states that *Upākarma* is included in the list of *karmas* prohibited from being observed till the *Ābdika* ceremony is over. This statement is quoted by the texts of religious codes and commentary viz.,-*vaidyanāthīya Varṇāśramācāra kānḍa* \(p. 219\), *Nirṇayasindhu* \(III 4791\) and *Dharmasindhu* P. 961\)

> स्न्नानं चैव महादानं स्वाध्यायं चाग्नितर्पणम् ।  
> प्रथमेऽब्दे न कुर्वीत महागुरुनिपातने ॥ 

\(Performing of *Snātakakarma, Mahādāna, Svādhyāya* and especially *Agnipūja* and even *Tarpaṇa* should not be done \(by a person\) when \(either of his\) parents has passed away, till the *Ābdika* \(ceremony\) is completed.\)

According to this, the aforesaid persons who are in the *pitṛdīkshā* do not perform *Upākarma* till the *Ābdika* is over. But there is a custom practiced by some, who perform the regular *Upākarma* even before the *Ābdika* is over. They defend their practice in the following way.

a\) The word *svādhyāya* referred to in the above *śloka* does not mean *Upākarma*. It means *upanayana* \(thread ceremony\) \(“स्वाध्यायः” उपनयनं तदर्थत्वात् उपनयनस्य\). Therefore only *upanayana* is prohibited and not *Upākarma*.

b\) If *sapinḍīkaraṇa* is scheduled to be performed at the end of the year, *Upākarma* is prohibited as per the above *śloka*. But if *sapinḍīkaraṇa* is done earlier then the performer’s body does not remain *aśuci*. Therefore *Upākarma* can be performed before the *Ābdika.*

But there is no statement or indication in the above *śloka* that *Upākarma* is prohibited only for persons who perform *sapinḍikaraṇa* at the end of the year.

“*Upākarma* can be observed or dropped as per one’s family custom”— This is one of the solutions to be above problem.

“Those who have the strength of mind and feel that they are not impure as they have performed *sapinḍīkarṇa* earlier can observe *Upākarma*. But those who feel in their hearts that they are mentally and spiritually in *pitṛdikshā* during the entire year, and so have no right to perform the auspicious ritual of *Upākarma* which is both *daiva* \(related to gods\) and *Ārsha* \(related to sages\)”—This is also considered as the suitable solution to the problem.

Also, points like why *Upākarma* should be performed, what is the benefit from it and what one stands to lose if it is not performed should also be discussed.

“The first *Upākarma* which comes after the *upanayana* is called *prathamopakarma*. *Brahmacāris* acquire the right to do *brahmayajna* only after performing *prathamopākarma*. “After that, by the observance of *Upākarma* by them every year, their *vedādhyayana* gets refreshed. The newness which causes prosperity is obtained by that. The study of the *vedas* which has become stale, gets renewed” - say the *śāstras*.

> प्रत्यब्दं यदुपाकर्म सोत्सर्गं विधिवध् द्विजैः ।  
> क्रियते छन्दसां तेन पुनराप्यायनं परम् ॥ \(कात्यायन\) 

> अयातयामैश्छंदोभिः यत्कर्म क्रियते द्विजैः ।  
> क्रीडमानैरपि सदा तत्तेषां वृद्धिकारणम् ॥  
\(वैद्यनाथीय, वर्णाश्रमाचारकाड page 53\) 

The abovesaid benefit will not accrue to one who does not observe *Upkārma*.

## Utsarjana

It is necessary to take note of another important observence regarding the study of *Vedas*. It is called ‘*Adhyāyotsarjana*’ or shortly *utsarjana*’.

What is this *Utsarjana*? *Utsarjana* or *Udvāsana* means leaving off or sending off. Leaving off what? It is the \(leaving off of\) vedic studies. On the day of *Upākarma*, after the worship of sages and deities, *Vedas* have to be begun \(again\) as per precepts, and having studied thus for a period of time constantly, the studies should be suspended temporarily, and the duration of studies also has to be limited. But that time, \(at the disposal of the student\) should not be idled away. It should be well utilized for the special study of *śāstras* which are the limbs of the *Vedas*. And again on the day of *upākarma*, the study of the *Vedas* should again be begun as per precepts. Thus, for the purpose of the special study of the *śāstras*, the constant study of the *Vedas* is suspended in an auspicious way. This itself is *Utsarjana*.

In ancient times the study of both the *vedas* and the *Śāstras* used to take place \(simultaneously\) and the presiding goddesses of the divine knowledge and wisdom of both streams would be pleased. But \(such a system is almost lost and\) much *apacāra* injustice is committed regarding this in our schools of *vedas* and *samskṛta*. One of the main *apacāra* refers to the time allotted for the curriculum of the *vedas* and scriptures. The six *śāstras* viz *śikshā*, *vyākaraṇa*, *chandas*, *Nirukta jyotisha* and *kalpa* are called *vedāṅgas*. Besides these, *tarka*, *mīmāmsā sānkhya*, *yoga* and other *Śāstras*, *Itihāsa* and *purāṇas* were taught by the sages for the purpose of explaining and preserving the *vedas*. But unfortunately in our present day *samskṛta pāṭhaśālas*, curriculum and timetables have been designed in such a way that these two \(i.e. the *vedas* and *vedāṅgas*\) cannot coexist \(in the same body of studies\). Thus, a scholar who has specialized in *tarka*, *vyākaraṇa* etc and has obtained a degree in them need not have even a smattering of the knowledge of the *vedas*. And, Vedic scholars may not find the need to have the knowledge of grammar and other *Śāstras*.\! It has become a tradition where scholars who study logic etc ridicule vedic scholars calling them *‘vedādhyāna jaḍa’* \(indolent and lazy vedic practitioner\) and vedic scholars jeering them as *‘aśrotriya‘* \(one who has no knowledge of the *vedas* and scriptures\) and *‘avaidika’* \(one who is not well versed in the Vedas.\). “The body \(i.e. the *vedas*\), the limbs and the bodyguards are free to remain strangers to each other. Even if they are familiar, they can look at each other with contempt - This seems to be the end result of the unscientific curriculum that is in vogue now.

Hundreds of texts have been written that are enough to bury the *vedas* and *vedaṅgas* gifted to us by our great *Ṛshis*. And those who carry the load of the knowledge of these books are considered great scholars. The current curriculum is not helpful to prepare a scholar who has sufficient knowledge of the *vedas*, *vedāṅgas*, logic and other scriptures.

But, in the curriculum of the *Maharshis*, there existed a scheme in which every student could obtain a sufficient knowledge of the *Vedās, vedāṅgas* and *śāstras*. These was a system in which every student could have access to the happy union of the body, the limbs and the bodyguards. In that scheme, the student could study the *vedas*, continuously, starting with *Upākarma* and ending with *utsarjana*. And again starting from *Utsarjana*, they could take up the study of the *śāstras* with special emphasis, till the next *Upākarma*. By this all students could gain the knowledge of both the *Vedas* and *śāstras* and the society would greatly benefit from this.

Earlier, we have noted that as per precepts, *Upākarma* should be taken up in *Śrāvaṇa* or *Bhādrapada*. Now, we shall discuss what is the right time for the \(temporary\) suspension of the study of the *Vedas,* and the scheme for taking up the study of the *Vedas* and *Śāstras* thereafter.

The *Manudharma śāstra* states that *utsarjana* should be done on the morning of *śukla prathama* of the months of *pushya* or *māgha*, outside the town \(near a great river, sea or a lake\)

> पुष्ये तु छन्दसां कुर्यात् बहिरुत्सर्जनं द्विजः ।  
> माघशुक्लस्य वा प्राप्ते पूर्वाहणे प्रथमेऽहनि ॥ 

Sage *Āpastamba* states that this sacred rite should be performed on the *Pūrṇima* of the month of *pushya*, or on the day of star *Rohiṇi* in the same month.

पौष्यां पौर्णमास्यां रोहिण्यां वा विरमेत्

		
*Yājṅavalkya* instructs that it should be performed on the day of star *Rohiṇi* in *Pushyamāsa* or on the day of *Ashṭaka* \(i.e. the *Ashṭami* of *Kṛshṇapaksha*\)

> पौषमासस्य रोहिण्यामष्टकायामथापि वा।  
> जलान्ते छंदसां कुर्यादुत्सर्गं विधिवद्बहिः ॥ 

After evaluating these, the *Nirṇayasindhu* states the conclusion as follows:—“Those who observe *Upākarma* in *Śrāvaṇa* should do *utsarjana* on the *śukla prathama* of *Pushya*, and those who observe *Upākarma* in *Bhādrapada* should do *utsarjana* in the morning of *śuklaprathama* in the month of *Māgha*. Those who follow *Āpastamba sūtra*, should do the *utsarjana* on *Pushya Pūrṇima* or on the day of *Rohiṇi Nakshatra* in *pushya*. Those who follow *Bodhāyana sūtra* should do *utsarjana* either in *pushya* or *māgha. Ṛgvedis* should do it on the *Pūrṇima* of *māgha*. \(“अध्यायोत्सर्जनं माध्यां पौर्णमास्यां विधीयते”\) *Sāmavedis* should do it when the sun is with *simha* in the month of *pushya*. Those who follow *kātyāyana sūtra* should do *Utsarjana* in the month of *Bhādrapada*.”

But some *smṛtis* say - “On the whole, it should be understood that the months of *Pushya* and *Māgha*, the *tithis Pūrṇima*, *śuklaprathamā* and *Kṛshṇāshṭami* and the star *Rohiṇi* are best suited for the ritual of *Vedotsarjana,* in the view of the sages.”

> पुष्ये तूत्सर्जनं कुर्यादुपाकर्म दिने तथा \(खादिरगृह्य\)  
> उत्सर्जनं पौषमासे उपाकर्म दिने तथा \(स्मृतिसमुच्चय\) 

But doing *utsarjana* on the day of *Upākarma* itself is not the main option. It is a secondary alternative advised for those who cannot do *utsarjana* on the prescribed day due to some unforeseen problems or illness. Then, what about the arrangement pertaining to the study of *Vedas* and *śāstras* from the time of *Utsarjana* on the prescribed day till the next *Upākarma*? The great sages have the following to say:

After the *utsarjana*, *vedādhyana* should be done only in the *śuklapakshas.* The *vedāṅgas* should be studied in the *Kṛshṇapakshas*. But the *Vedaṅgas* may be studied on the days of *anadhyayana* also.

> अत ऊर्ध्वं तु छन्दांसि शुक्लेषु नियतः पठेत् । \(मनु\)  
> वेदाङ्गानि तु सर्वाणि कृष्णपक्षेषु सम्पठेत् ॥ 

> वेदोपकरणे चैव स्वाध्याये चैव नैत्यके ।  
> नानुरोधोऽस्त्यनध्याये होममन्त्रेषु चैव हि ॥  
> अत ऊर्ध्वं शुक्लपक्षेष्वधीयीत, कामं तु वेदाङ्गानि” \(वसिष्ठस्मृति\) 

Well, what is the use of doing *adhyāyotsarjana* \(temporary suspension\) at the proper time? The answer is, whatever the benefit that is obtained by *Upākarma* will be obtained by *utsarjana* also. That is, the study of the *Vedas* does not get stale but gets renewed. Or, in other words, without getting stale and insipid, it becomes strengthened. So, *saṅkalpas* with only the following purport should be uttered—“अधीतानां अध्येयमाणानां वेदानां यातयामतानिरासेन आप्यायनद्वारा सवीर्यत्वाय अध्यायोत्सर्जनाख्यम्..... अध्यायोपाकर्माख्यं कर्म करिष्ये”

If one cannot to do *utsarjana* at the proper time, he should undertake the appropriate *prāyaścitta* and then perform *Upākarma*.

The atonements are as follows:

1. Performing *Homa* with *Ājya* in fire with the *mantras* “कामोकार्षिन्मन्युरकार्षीत् स्वाहा” or performing the *japa* of \(the *mantra*\) “कामोकार्षीन्मन्युरकार्षीत्” 
2. Doing *Prāṇāyāma* 16 times 
3. Doing the *japa* of *Virajāmantra* appearing in *mahānārāyaṇa*, or doing *Ājyahoma* with that. 
4. Performing the *Homa* called पाहि त्रयोदश” etc., 

These *prāyascittas* are powerful enough to routout the blemishes caused by not observing *utsarjana* at the right time, and can also provide atonement for the other *doshas* that have been caused during the whole year. They contain very powerful *mantras* and *tantras* which can redeem all the sins.

The purport of these \(*mantras*\) is as follows:-

“I did not observe *utsarjana* at the proper time. It was because of my own *kāma* and *krodha*. Let me be freed from these *doshas*. Let my *rajoguṇa* and all my sins get redeemed. Let both my internal and external sense organs and my body be completely purified. I will become an inherently pure *jyothissvarūpa* \(form of divine light\). I will reach the state of *parama satya* \(supreme truth\) through *sapta vyāhṛtis*. I \(we\) will meditate upon the sin-redeeming and the supreme effulgence of the creator Lord who incites \(stimulates\) our minds in *Dharma* and *jnāna*. It is the *Parabrahma Paramātma* who becomes comprehensible by *praṇava*. It is the abode of the divine nectar called ‘*Āpojyoti*’. It is the trueform of *Sat, Cit* and *Ānanda*. O divine fire in the form of God\! save me from sins: help me to get over all the adversities. Destroy both my internal and external enemies. Bless me with all the wealth I aspire for.”

There is no need to observe *prāyascitta* if *utsarga* is done on the day of *Upākarma* itself, because the day of *Upākarma* also happens to be an important time for *utsarjana*. If one can not do it in *pushya māsa*, it can be done on the day of *Upākarma* itself. “उत्सर्जनं चेन्न करोति पुष्ये सहैव कुर्यादुभयं तदा तु” \(स्मृतिसमुच्चय\)

1\) Some say that *utsarjana* done even on the day of the *Upākarma* will not be *kālātīta*. But it is not correct.

*Śāstras* have not stated that this is the best option. Those who cannot do it at the proper time due to illness etc., and thus take it up at the time of *gouṇakalpa*, must atone for it. Is not the fourth *ārghya* offered during *sandhyāvandanam* as atonment if the *ārghya pradāna* happens to be offered beyond the stipulated time? In the same way, we opine. that atonement should also be done here. It is best to take up \(the study of\) both the *Vedas* and *śāstras* in the time most suited naturally. And the *śāstras* determine \(and state\) such \(best\) times.

2\) Some who cannot do *utsarjana* in *pushya* atone for it but observe *Upākarma* without performing *utsarjana* afterwards. This is also not quite correct. The rule that the regular three *ārghyapradānas* should not be given up just because the special *arghya* is offered anyway as atonement, should be remembered here as an example. Not doing *utsarjana* at all should not become a tradition.

1\) Another important thing. Atonement is done when an omission is caused unknowingly or because of illness. But it is not prudent to commit the mistake of not performing the rite at the proper time, in spite of being fully fit to perform it, taking shelter under atonement.

Now, we shall discuss briefly the modalities of conducting *Upākarma* and *utsarjanas* and also discuss some important matters related to them.

We come across many similarities and differences in the rituals pertaining to these, as per different *vedaśākhas* and *sūtras*.

Some rituals viz., invocation of sages, *pūja*, *tarpaṇa*, and *homa* with reference to them, wearing of the new sacred thread, and the study of the beginning parts of the *Vedas* are common to all the *śakhas* and *sūtras*. And, to a great extent, there are similarities in the performance of *utsarjana* and *Upākarma* also.

The modality of those who follow the *āshvalāyana prayoga* of *Ṛgveda*, is as follows: First, *Nāndīśrāddha* is performed in the ritual of *utsarjana*. *Pradakshiṇa granthis* \(knots in the clockwise order\) are made in *darbhas* and wearing the sacred threads in the *Nivīti* \(position\), the seven sages viz. *Gautama, Atri, Bharadhvāja, Vishvāmitra, Kashyapa, Jamadagni* and *Vasishṭha* are invoked and they are worshipped with the sixteen fold *upācaras*, and *ārghya* is offered to them. And then in the *Upavīti* position nine personages namely *Sāvitrī, Brāhmī, Śraddhā, Medhā, Prajnā, Dhāraṇā, Sadasaspati, Anumati* and *Chandorshi* are \(invoked and\) offered ghee oblations with *svāhākāras;* and *homa* is \(to be\) performed to twenty *devatās*. \(Beginning with *Agni* the twenty *devatas* are *agni-aptṛnasūryas*, *agni-śakunta*, *agni-mitrāvaruṇa*, *agni-āpas, agni-maruttas*, *agni-varma*, *agni-indrāsomas*, *Indra*, *agnimaruts*, *pavamānasoma*, *soma-agni*, and *samjnāna*\). Then *Gāyatrī* is chanted three times in the method of *upadeśa* followed by the recitation of the beginning parts of *Ṛgveda,* or the four *Vedas* and the *vedāṅgas*. Later the *Paridhāniyamantra* viz *‘Namo Brahmaṇe’* is chanted thrice and the *Anusandhāna* is done with the *mantra*.

“संज्ञानं उशनावदत् ओं उत्सृष्टा वै वेदाः” \(The *utsarjana* of the *Vedas* is done\)

Next, *Ācāryās* such as *Agni* and *Gautama* should be saluted and *tarpaṇa* should be offered to *Sāvitri* etc. with the *mantra* ‘सावित्रीं तर्पयामि’ \(the *Tarpaṇa* is offered to *Sāvitri, Brāhmi, Śraddhā, Medhā, Prājnā, Dhāraṇā, Sadasaspati, Anumati, Chandāmsi, Ṛshayah, Agni-Sūrya, Agni-Śakunta, Agni-Mitravaruṇa, Agni-Āpa, Agni-maruttas, Agni-varma, Agni-Indrāsomas, Indra, Agni-maruta, Pavamānasoma, Soma-Agni* and *Samjnāna*\) The following *devatās* should be offered *tarpaṇa* by chanting *‘tṛpyantu’*-They are *agni, Vishṇu, Prajāpati, Brahmavedas,* god, *Ṛshis, Sarvachandas, Omkāra, Vashaṭkāra, Vyāhṛtis, Sāvitrī, Yajnas, Dhyāvāpṛthvis, Antariksha, Ahorātras, Sānkhyas, Siddhas*, oceans, rivers, mountains, holy places, medicinal plants, trees, *Gandharvas, Nāgas*, birds, cows, *Sūryas, vipras, yakshas, rākshasas* and *Bhūtas*.

Then wearing the sacred thread in the *nivīthi* position and chanting *‘tṛpyantu’*, the following *ṛshīs* viz., — *Śatarcinah, Mādhyamāh, Gṛtsamada, Viśvāmitra, Vāmadeva, Atri, Vasishṭha, Pragāthāh, Pāvamānyah, Kshudrasūktāh, Mahasūkthāh, Sanakah, Sanātana, Sanandana, Sanatkumāra, Sanatsujāta, Kapila, Olha, Āsuri* and *Pancaśikha* should be offered *tarpaṇa*.

Next, switching over to *Prācīnāvīti*, the following personages viz.-*Sumantu, Jaimini, Vaiśampāyana, Paila, Sūtrabhāshya, Bhārata-Mahābhārata Dharmācāryas* \(2\) *Jānantī, Nāhavī, Gārgya — Gautama, Śākalya, Bābhravya, Māndavya, Māndūkeyas* \(3\) *Gārgī, Vācaknavī* \(4\) *Badabā Prācītheyī, sulabha maithreyī, Kahola, Kaushītaka, Mahākaushītaka, Paiṅgya, Mahāpaiṅgya, Suyajna, Sānkhyāyana, Aitareya, Mahaitareya, Śākala, Bāshkala, Sujātavaktra, Oudavāhi, Mahaudavāhi, Saujāmi, Śaunaka, Āshvalāyana*, and other *Ācāryas* should be offered *tarpaṇa* by chanting ‘*tṛpyantu*’. Afterwards, those who are *adhikāris* \(the ones who are supposed to perform\) should offer *tarpaṇa* to their *pitṛs*. And then Lord *Yama* should be offered *tarpaṇa* \(invoking him\) by the names viz., *Yamam, Dharmarājam, Mṛtyum, antakam, Vaivasvatam, Kālam, Sarvabhūthakshayam, Oudumbaram, Dhadhnam, Nīlam, Parameshṭhinam, Vrkodaram, Citram, Citraguptam*, and then the *japa* of the names of *yama* should be performed ten times with the *śloka*-

“यमो निहन्ता पितृधर्मराजो वैवस्वतो दण्डधरश्च कालः ।  
> भूताधिपो दत्तकृतानुसारी कृतान्त एतद्दशभिर्जपन्ति ॥” 

And the *Śānti sūktas* viz “आ नो भद्राः” etc should be chanted for peace, and the *parjanya sūkta* for abundant rains. Then chanting the *mantra* “विश्वेत्ता ते” the *udvāsana* \(giving a send off\) to *ṛshīs* should be performed in water, and after *acamana*, addressing the *vedas*. Brahmins should be fed.

Same is the case with *Upākarma* also after *Mādhyāhnika*. *Tarpaṇa* to seven *ṛshis* viz. *Gautama* etc. follows *Nāndīśrāddha*. Then, *homa* to *Sāvitri* and others is performed. Flour made from unbroken rice and wheat should be mixed in cow’s curds, and *homa* should be performed for twenty *devatās* beginning with *agni*. Then the *Ācārya* and the disciples should consume the *prasāda* of flour mixed with curds, and perform *Ācamana*. *Yajnopavīta homa* and *yajnopavītna dāna* should be performed and new *Yajnopavīta* should be put on. *Brahmacārīs* should wear new *kaṭisūtra* \(waist band\), *kaupīna* \(loin cloth\), *Kṛshṇājīna* \(skin of black antelope\), *yajnopavītha*, cloth, *mounjī* and *danḍa* \(staff\).

As part of *Upākarma, sankalpa* to perform *brahmayajna* in the form of study should be made. *Gāyatrī* together with *oṅkāra* and *vyāhṛti* should be chanted three times in the *upadeśakrama*. Then, the *Japa* of the beginnings of the *Vedas* and the *vedaṅgas* should be done. The *paridhanīyamantra* viz “नमो ब्रह्मणे” should be uttered three times. And reciting the lines “संज्ञानमुशनावदत्, ओं, उपाकृता वै वेदाः” it should be stated that the *Upākarma* of *Vedas* is completed. Salutation should be offered to *Agni* and *Ṛhis* and *Ācāryas* such as *Gauthama* and others *prāyaścitta* homa should be performed and finally addressing the *Vedas*. Brahmins should fed.

The *Śukla Yajurvedis* include *Arundhatīdevi*, *Yājnavalkya* and the *Ṛshīs* of their *Gotra* and *Vishṇu* in the invocation-worship of the *Saptarshis*. In the *tarpaṇa* ritual, they include *Vishvedevas*, gods, *chandas, vedas*, *ṛshīs Purāṇacāryas, Gandharvas*, other *Ācāryas* and *sāvana samvatsaras* \(years\), *pitṛs, acāryas* and *samvatsaras*.

People possessing the authority to do *tarpaṇa*, offer it to their *pitṛs* and *pitṛs* of their *ācāryas*. After that, they recite and salute the chain of *ṛshis* whose names are mentioned in the *Vamśa*, *Prativamśa, adhyāya, śanta, prapāthaka* and the *antyakānḍas* \(final cantos\), and perform *ṛshi Śrāddha*.

The main deities among the ones whom these \(i.e. the *Śuklayajurvedīs*\) meditate upon, offer worship and *Homa* in the *Upākarma* are *prajāpati, Indra, Agni, Soma, Pṛthvī, Brahmā, Chandas, Dina*, \(day\) *Sūrya* \(sun\), *Brahma*, god, *ṛshis, Śraddhā, medhā*, and *Sadasaspatis*. They are offered *homa* with *Ājya*. *Homa* is performed to *Sadasaspati* with paddy, to *Savitṛdevatas* with gingelly seeds, and to *svishṭakṛt agni* with the remaining paddy. *Yajna* is performed with respect to the secondary and main deities viz., *Vāyu, Sūrya Agni-Varuṇa, Savitṛ, Vishṇu, Viśvedevas, Marutas*, *Arkas, Varuṇa, Āditya, Aditi*, and *Prajāpati*, twenty seven *Ahutis* such as *pṛthivi* are offered with *ghee* to the four *Vedas*. The *Prasādas* in the form of rice and curds are consumed in such a way that they do not come into contact with teeth.

Then *ācārya* offers as many gingelly seeds as *Āhutīs* in the *homa* as the number of groups of *śishyas* he needs. Then he offers nine *Āhutis* beginning with *Bhooh*. Now he should take up *Adhyayana* of the parts of the *Vedas* preceded by *Gāyatrī* with *Oṅkāra* and *Vyāhrtis* and he should make the *śishyas* also to do *Adhyayana,* beginning with *Ishetvā* in his own *śākha* and ending with

1. *Iśāvāsya* 
2. *Adhyāyas* of all *Mantrabrāhmaṇas* 
3. *ṛshimukhas* of *Ṛgveda* 
4. *Parvas* of *Samavedis* and 
5. *Sūktas* of *Atharva veda*. 

Those who belong to *Āpastambasūtra* of *kṛshṇayajurveda* should invoke, worship, offer *tarpaṇa* and perform *homa* to the following *Ṛshis* viz. *Prajāpati*, *Soma, Agni, Viśvedevas, Sāmhitī devatas*, *Yājnikī devatas, Vāruṇī devatās, Brahmasvayambhū*, and *sadasaspati*. These are called *Kānḍarshis*. *Tarpaṇa* to these *ṛishīs* should be offered with *Akshata* and water mixed with white gingelly. The practice of adding sandal paste and flowers is also there. Some people do it using only *akshatā* and water. *Tarpaṇa* is offered in *Nivīti*. Some perform *homa* to the beginning parts of all the *vedas*.

The *mantras* to be taken up for *Adhyayana* are the four *anuvākas* i.e. *Ishetvā* etc. of *Kṛshṇayajurveda samhitā*. Some people perform *virajāhoma* also, after doing *Brahmayajna*, and then chanting the beginning parts of the *Brāhmaṇas* and *Upanishats* along with the beginning *Anuvāka* of that *Samhitā*, the *Śāntimantras*, the *Ādimantras* of the other *Vedas* and the beginning parts of the *vedāngas*. At the beginning, *virajāhoma* is also performed with *Tilamantras* viz. “तिलां जुहोमि” “तिलाः कृष्णा तिलाः श्वेताः”

In case *Utsarjana* is to be done on the day of *Upākarma* itself, there is a practice of performing the homa *“Pāhi Trayodaśa”* by some, who wish to atone for the *Kālātītadosha*. And some, wishing to atone for not doing *Adhyāyotsarjana* at the proper time, perform the *japa* of either the *mantras* ‘कामोकार्षीत् मन्युरकार्षीत्’ or *virajā mantra* or both. There is also a custom of doing sixteen *prāṇāyāmas* as atonement. Then *utsarjana* is done followed by *Upākarma*. Some people do *Upākarma* along with *utsarjana* or perform *Upākarma* without *utsarjana* also.

Those who belong to *Bodhāyanasūtra* offer *tarpaṇa* in *nivīti* to the nine *kānḍarshis* viz., *Yajnikīrdevatāh*, *Samhitīrdevatāh, Varuṇīrdevatāh, Sarvadevatāh, Prajāpati, Soma, Agni, Viśvedevāh*, and *Svayambhu*. And *tarpaṇa* is offered in *upavīti* to *sadasaspati*, *savitṛ*, four *Vedas*, *Atharvāngirasa*, *Itihāsa Purāṇa*, *Sarvadevajana*, *Sarvabhūtas*, *Sādhyas, Brahma, Prajāpati, Parameshṭhī, Hiraṇyagarbha*, *Caturmukha Svayambhu, Agnivāyu, Brahmapārshadas*, *Brahmapārshadis*, *Varuṇa, Soma, Sūrya, Candra, Nakshatra*, *Sadyojāta, Purusha* with three *Vyahṛtis* individually and collectively, seven *Vyāhṛtīs, Bhava, śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Rudra, Ugra, Bhīma* and *Mahādeva’s* consorts, *Rudras, Rudrapārshadas, Rudrapārshadis, Sanaka*, *Sanandana, Sanatkumāra Sanatsujāta, Skanda, Indra, Jayanta, Shashṭhi, Shanmukha, Viśākha, Subrahmaṇya, Mahāsena Skandapārshadas, Vighnavināyaka, Vīra, Śūra, Varada, Hastimukha, Lambodara, Ekadanta, Śūrpakarṇa, Ibhavaktra, Vighnapārshadas, Vighnapārśadīs, Navagrahas, Yama, Dharmarāja, Dharma, Mṛtyu, Antaka, Vaivasvata, kāla, Sarvabhūtayaksha, Oudumbara, dadhna, Nīla, Paramesṭhī, Vṛkodara, Citra, Citragupta, Vaivasvata’s Pārshadas, Vaivasvatpārshadis, Bharadvāja, Gautama, Angīrasa, Bārhaspatya, Viśvāmitra, Jamadagni, Vidyā, Atri, Dhanvantari, Dhanvantari pārshadas, Keśava, Nārāyaṛa, Mādhava, Govinda, Vishṇu, Madhusūdana, Trivikrama Vāmana, Śrīdhara, Hṛshīkeśa, Padmanābha, Dāmodara, Saṅkarshaṇa, Vāsudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Purushottama, Nārasimha, Adhokshaja, Acyutha, Janārdana, Upendra, Hari, Śrīkṛshṇa, Śrīdevi, Hridevi, Buddhidevi, Pushṭi, Tushṭi, Jyeshṭha, MahāŚrīlakshmī, Vishṇupārshadas and Vishṇupārshadis*.

Then *tarpaṇa* should be offered in *nivīti* to the *Ṛshis, Maharshis, Paramarshīs, Brahmarshis, Devarshis, Rājarshi, Vaishyarshi, Sutarshi, Sūtarshi, Śrutarshi, janarshi, taparshi, Satyarshi, Kānḍarshi, Ṛshigaṇa, Ṛshipathnīs Ṛshiputrās, Ṛshipauthrās, Kaṇva, Bodhāyana, Āpastambasūtrakāras, Satyāshāḍhas, Hiraṇyakeśis, Vājasaneyas, Yājnavalkya, Śaunaka, Āsvalāyana, Drāhyāyaṇa, Kātyāyana, Vyāsa, Vasishṭha, Praṇava, Vyāhṛtis, Prajāpati, Kāndarshī, Soma, Agni, Viśvedevāh, Svayambhu, Sadasaspati, Sāvitrī, Gāyatrī, Chandas, the four Vedas, Itihāsapurāṇas, Sarvadevajanas, Sarvabhūtas, Sāgmhitīdevatās, Yājnikīdevatās, Vāruṇīdevatās and Sarvadevatās*.

Then *tarpaṇa* should be offered to *Pitṛs* along with *Svadhākāra* in *Prācīnāvīti*. All the *pitṛs* should be offered *tarpaṇa*. The *pitṛs* should be offered *tarpaṇa* with the *mantra* ‘ऊर्ध्वं वहन्ती’ also.

Afterwards *ācamana* should be done in *upavītī*, and the beginning of the study of the *Vedas* should be done along with *Saṅkalpa*.

The *sāmavedīs*, offer *tarpaṇa* to the following *devatās* in *upavītī* chanting *“Trpyatu”, “trpyantu”*. They are - *Agni, Brahma, Somah, Śivah, Prajāpatih, Savitā, Indrah, Bṛhaspatih, Tvashṭā, Vishṇuh, Yamah, Ādityah, candramāh, Nakshatrāṇī, Vasus with Sahadevatās Rudrāh, Ādityāh, Bhṛgavah, Angīrasah, Sādhyāh, Marutah, Viśvedevāh, Sarvedevāh, Vāk, Prāna, Āpa, Oshadhayah, Indrāgnī, Dhāta, Aryamā, Sārdhamāsāh, Ṛthavah, Ditih, Aditih, Indrāṇī, Umā, Śrīh*, all the *Devapatnīs, Rudrah, Skandavishakhau, Vishvakarmā, Darśa, Paurṇamāsa, cāturvedya, Cāturhoutra, Vaihārika, Pākayajna, Sthāvarajaṅgama, parvatāśishah, Bhavyah, Nadyah, Samudrah, Apāmpatih, Yajamānā, ye devāh Ekādaśakāh, Trayaśca-trimśacca Thrayaśca Trīṇi Ca Sahasrāh, Dvipavitryādevah, Ekapavitrādevah, Manushyaprabhṛtayah, sankarshaṇavāsudevau, Dhanvantarih, Sādhukārah, Udaravaiśravaṇah- Pūrnabhadramānibhadrāh, Yāthudhānah, Yakshāh, Rakshāgmsi, Itaragaṇah, Traiguṇyam, Nāmākhyātopasarganipātāh, Devarshayah, Mahāvyāhṛtayah, Sāvitrīṛcah, Yajūmshi, Sāmāni, Kānḍāni, Eshām Daivatāni, Prāyashcittāni, Śukrayopanishadah, śokī, Śukah, Śākalyah, Pāṅcālah Ṛcābhih.*

The *Ṛshis* who should be offered *tarpaṇa* in the *Nivītī* position with the utterance of *‘tṛpyatu’* are—*Vyāsah, pārāśaryah, tānḍī, kukī, kuśrah, Kauśikī, Baḍabā, Prācitheyī, Maitrāyaṇī, Dakshāyaṇī, Sarvācārāyāh, Kulācāryāh, Gurukulavāsinah, Kanyāh, Brahmacārī, Ātmārthī Yājnavalkya, Rāṇāyani, Sātyamugrī, Durvāsāh, Bhāguri, Gaurunḍi, Gālgulavi, Bhagavānaupamanyavah Dārālah, Gārgisāvarṇī, Varshagaṇya, Kuthumi, Śālihotra Jaimini* - these eleven *Sāmagācāryas* called *Śalihotra Jaimini* \(with the desire that these who are satisfied with *tarpaṇa* may bless\) and the ten discoursers viz. *Śaṭi, Bhāllavi, Kālabhavi, Tānḍya, Vṛk, Vrshāṇaka, Ṭhuraki, Agatsya, Batkaśirāh, and kuhūh* -\(May they be satisfied, and cause auspiciousness\)

After this, *Deva tarpaṇa* should be offered to these Gods in *Upavīti with the chanting of Tṛpyatu viz., Agnih, Brahmā, Devāh, Vedāh, Omkārah, Sāvitrī, Yajnāh, Dhyāvāprthivī, Ahorātras, Sānkhyāh, Samudrāh, Kshetra, Oshadhi, Vanaspatis, Gandharvas, Apsarasas, Nāgas, Yakshas, Rākshasas and other Gaṇas and Bhūtas*

Afterwards, the following *Ṛshis* should be offered *tarpaṇa* in *Nivītī* with the utterance of *svadhā*. They are—

*Sumantu, Jaimini, Vishvāmitra, Vasishṭha, Parāśara, Jānanti, Bāhava, Gautama, Śakalya, Bābhravya, Māndavya, Baḍabā, Prācitheyī, Maitrayaṇī, Dākshāyaṇī, other Ācāryas.*

Then with the chanting of *‘tṛptirastu’* the following *devatās* should be offered *tarpaṇa* in *Upavītī*-

नमो ब्रह्मणे तृप्तिरस्तु, नमो ब्राह्मणेभ्यः, नमः आचार्येभ्यः, नमः ऋषिभः नमो देवेभ्यः, नमो वेदेभ्यः, नमो वायवे च, नमो मृत्यवे च, नमो विष्णवे च, नमो वैश्रवणाय च ।

Then, as per *vamśavidyā paramparā*, with the chanting of *tṛptirastu* in the *nivīti* position, the *Ṛishis ‘śarvadattāt gārgyāt’* etc. and *Rādho Gautamah* etc. should be offered *tarpaṇa*. Now, switching over to *Upavīti* and as per *Vamśavidyāparamparā*, deities such as *‘Agnirindrāt’* and, again in *nivīti*, the chain of *Ṛishis* viz., *Aryamabhūti* etc should be offered *tarpaṇa*.

In the end, in *Prācīnāvītī, Pitṛtarpaṇa* should be done to the following *pitṛs*, with the chanting of *‘tṛptirastu’ viz., Pitṛṇām, Pitāmahānām, Prapitāmahāṇam, Mātṛṇam, Mātāmahānām, Pramātāmahānām, Ācāryāṇam, Prācāryāṇam Samhitakāra, Padakāra, Sūtrakāra Brāhmaṇa Kārāṇām, Brāhmaṇānāmapatyānām, Brāhmanīnām Ekapatnīnām, Anapatyānām Sarvesham ca Brahmacāriṇām*. Then *‘Ācamana’* in *Upavīti*, should be done.

We can find these deliberations in more detail in the *Prayogagranthas* of the respective *Vedaśākhās* and *Sūtraśākhās*. Then why some of them which are important have been mentioned here in brief? It is because they are essential for retrospection which is necessary for some important clarifications regarding the *Upākarma Prayoga* taught by *sanātana Ārya Bhārata Maharshis* which can be obtained by comparison \(of the *Prayogas*\)

1\) Why should *Upākarma* be observed? The *Maharshis* provide the answer stating as follows: By performing *Upākarma*, the *Vedas* which have been studied become refreshed again and become robust. Otherwise *vedas* get stale. So, if the *Vaidika Karmas* are performed giving no room for staleness and with refreshness accomplished, they lead to prosperity.

> क्रियते छंदसां तेन पुनराप्यायनं परम् ।  
> अयातयामैश्छन्दोभिः यत् कर्म क्रियते द्विजैः ॥  
> क्रीडमानैरपि सदा तत्तेषां वृद्धिकारणम्॥ \(कात्यायन\) 

But some who revere the *Vedas* deeply, raise the following objection to the above answer as follows: “The *Vedas* are eternal literature “अनादिनिधना ह्येषा वागुत्सृष्टा स्वयम्भुवा”. *Vedas* do not undergo any *Vikāra*. They are the very breath of the Lord who is the embodiment of truth. They neither become stale nor get refreshed. When such is the case, there is no question of purifying them. So to state that *Upākarma* should be done to purify the *vedas* is far from truth. It amounts to an offence to the *Vedas*.” Those who raise this objection, it seems, have not properly understood the opinion \(intention\) purport of our great *Ṛshis*. *Vedas* are a mass of divine knowledge, or a form of divine knowledge. In the main sense, there is no question of them becoming stale. But the mind of the person who studies the *Vedas* gets impure and if his disposition gets loathsome because of pollution, there will be no vigour in his *Adhyayana*, or strength or inspiration. In this sense it may be stated that *Vedas* get stale with reference to him. How can *Vedas* shine in a mind which has become dull? In this sense only, the study of the *Vedas* get stale. A few examples can be given here. *Ātma* is always pure. But if one’s nature gets vicious, people call him wicked. If his nature becomes pure, he is called pure souled. In this sense the study of the *vedas* becomes worn out or faded. In this way, if the nature \(of the person\) is pure or impure, the *Ātma* is called pure or impure. So also by reason of the inertia or vigour of the mind of the student of the *Vedas*, they also get stale or refreshed, say the *śāstras*. When one says that the *Vedas* get stale, the real sense is that the mind of the person who is studying that has become impure or inert.

\(2\) How does the rite of *Upākarma* make the study of *vedas* refreshed? How is the dullness of the mind removed? The answer to these questions can be seen in the discussion on the ritual of *Upākarma*. During *Upākarma* we worship, offer *tarpaṇa* etc to the deities of *Vedas* and *Ṛshis*. By their grace and blessings, the inertia of the mind and the body gets out, and brings about freshness. The holy bath in a great river, the touch and sight of gingelly, *akshatā* and water, the wearing of a new sacred thread and new clothes etc. during *Upākarma* cause freshness.

There is a tradition to call this *vrata* as ‘*janivāradahabba*’, as all people wear a new *Yajnopavīta* on the day of *Upākarma*. On that day, *Brahmacāris* wear a new *mauñji*, hold a new staff of the flame tree, wear a new *Kṛshṇājina* and a new *kaupīna* along with a new *Yajnopavīta*. All these are things which bring about inspiration of freshness.

There is a *śāstraic* precept and tradition which state that *Brahmacāris* should have their hair cut on the morning of *Upākarma*. “ब्रह्मचारिणां उपाकर्मणि वपनमावश्यकम्” *\(Vaidyanāthīya, Varṇāśramācāra kānḍa\)* The *Vaikhānasa Sūtra* says “श्रावण्यां पौर्णमास्यां शिष्यं वापयित्वा”

Question \(3\) Sometimes *Upākarma* falls on some days, *tithis* and *Nakshatras* which are prohibited for a haircut. For example *Pūrṇima* is a day which is not auspicious for anyone other than *yatis* for *vapana* \(tonsure\). Tuesday is also an inauspicious day for a haircut. But if *Upākarma* happens to fall on any of these days because it is mandated by the scriptures. By the power of *Upākarma parva,* the demerits related to haircut on prohibited days will get removed.

> वैधे कर्मणि तु प्राप्ते कालदोषं न चिन्तयेत् ।  
> सद्यः क्षौरं प्रकुर्वीत मातापित्रोः मृतौ तथा ॥ 

\(4\) While offering *tarpaṇa* to *Devatas* and *Ṛshis,* some people use both *akshatā* of rice and *tila.* This has the support of the scriptures also.

> प्रजापति मुखान् देवान् एकैकं त्रिस्तिलोदकम्।  
> उद्धृत्य तर्पणं कुर्युः श्रावण्यां तैत्तिरीयकाः ॥ 

Some people are afraid that if tila is mixed \(in this *tarpaṇa*\), it becomes a *pitṛkarma*. This is not correct. “Only black *tila* is dear to *pitṛs*. White *tila* is dear to *devatās* and *tila* of mixed colours should be used for *tarpaṇa* to human beings.”—says *devala smṛti*.

शुक्लैस्तु तर्पयेद्देवान् मनुष्यान् शबलैस्तिलैः॥

The purport of this is that *tarpaṇa* should be offered to *devarshis* with water mixed with *akshatā*. Or, with water, mixed with white gingelly and akshata to *Devatās.*

The \(śāstraic\) statements that while gingelly is best for *tarpaṇa* to Gods and black gingelly is so for pitrs and *akshatās* for devarshis should not be construed to mean that they actually consume the tila and *akshatā* respectively. It is unfair to slight the *śastrās* by taking the meaning in a literal sense. We see with our own eyes that the tila and *akshatā* are eaten by fish and other aquatic animals when tarpaṇa is given in water. ***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru*** has expounded that when one says that *tila* and *akshatā* are dear to *devatās* and *Ṛshis*, it means that the sight and touch of tila and *akshatā* help the flowering of the inner spiritual centers inside our body and help to obtain their grace, and lead to spiritual realization. It is ridiculous to think that *pitṛs* and *devatas* who enjoy divine nectar, fill their bellies with *tila* and *akshatā*.

When *tila*, *akshatā* and other things are not available, *tarpaṇa* can be offered to them with mere water. When even water becomes unavailable, one may offer *tarpaṇa* with the flow of his pure mind, and *devatās* and *pitṛs* will feel pleased with that itself.

\(5\) Why should *tarpaṇa* be offered to *devatās* and *Ṛshis* on the day of *Upākarma*? It is just a service offered to them as a token of gratitude. It is indeed the *devatās* and *ṛshis* who have gifted us the *vedas* and *vaidik* rituals and have blessed us. We should offer grateful *tarpaṇa* to them every day. And it should be offered especially on the day of *Upākarma*, By their grace the inertia of the mind is removed and inspiration to perform *the Upākarma* of the vedas is obtained. Freshness is also obtained. Those who do not worship the *devatās* or *Ṛshis* will incur their curse. They will be enveloped by the stigma of ingratitude. “*Śāstras* say — “There is redemption for people who may commit *Brahmahatyā* and other sins. But, for an ungrateful person there is no redemption”

कृतध्ने नास्ति निष्कृतिः

\(6\) Some people begin the study of only the *vedamantras* on the day of *Upākarma*. Some others begin the study of *vedāṅgas* also with the *vedas*. Some argue “*Vedāṅgās, purāṇas, Itihāsas* etc. are indeed great *śāstras* whose study has to be taken up. But the study of them should not begin on the day of *Upākarma*. It should be done on an other day stipulated for that exclusively.” No doubt this argument is well reasoned. But those who do not begin the study of *Vedāṅgas, Itihāsas, Purāṇas*. etc., on other days, may begin on the day of *Upākarma* itself \(along with the *Vedas*\), instead of totally giving them up. This will not be a blemish. Because they are also the detailed *Upabṛhmhaṇas* of the *Vedaṅgas* and the meaning of the *vedas*.

\(7\) Some people have a custom of offering *Yajnopavīta* as *dāna* before the beginning of *Vedadhyayana* on the day of *Upākarmas*. This is quite in accordance with the *śāstras*. *Yajnopavīta* is one of many excellent *dravyās* which are giftworthy and, offering of that as *dāna* on that day is indeed special. Because of the merit obtained by gifting it, a special right is earned to wear a new one on that day.

\(8\) The custom of receiving *saktu* \(powdered popped rice\) and popped rice mixed with curds etc, as *prasāda* of *Ṛshis* and gods on that day is indeed good. These are auspicious *dravyas*, as the grace of the worshipped *devatās* and *ṛshis* who are dear to the *Vedapurusha* will have flown on them. The *śāstras* have prescribed them in the form of *naivedya* to *Ṛshis* and gods, as they \(the *dravyas*\) give *Tushṭi* and *Pushṭi* \(satisfaction and nourishment\) to the *Vedādhyayanamaṅgala* \(The auspicious study of the *vedas*.\)

\(9\) Some perform the *homa ‘pāhi trayodaśa’* as an atonement for the *kālātītadosha* \(demerits caused by delays\) and then perform *utsarga*. The day of *Upākarma* is important for *Utsarjana*. The treatise *‘khādiragṛhya’* says “तौष्यां तूत्सर्जनं कुर्यात् उपाकर्मदिने तथा” The *smṛti samuccaya* says उत्सर्जनं चेत् न करोति पुष्ये । सहैव कुर्यात् उभयं तथा तु । Some argue that the performance of the *homa* viz., *‘pāhi no’* is not correct, since *Upākarma* also is an important day for *utsarjana*. They condemn those who perform *‘pāhi homa’*. This is not right. Because the day of *Upākarma* is not the prime time for *utsarjana* but only a secondary time for it. There is a custom among some, who are *Medhārahitas* and who are unable to observe *utsarjana* in the proper time \(i.e. in *Pushya māsa*\) due to some difficulties. They do the *utsarjana* on the day of *Upākarma* itself. It can be only a secondary time and not the prime time. There is a rule that those who were unable to offer *arghya* to the sun at the prime time in *Sandhyāvandanam*, have to offer *prāyaścittā arghya* also during the secondary time. Likewise, those who are unable to do *utsarjana* at the right time and do it in the secondary time on the day of *Upākarma,* are right in observing atonement through *Prāyaścitta homa* etc. We feel that it is not wrong to do so. In this regard some people make a remark with instantly pleasing words. They say — “These days no one does *Vedādhyayana*. So they don’t have to do *utsarjana* at all. Detailed deliberations for *Upākarma* are also not needed at all”. It is not right on their part to speak lightly and without any seriousness, who say “Wearing of the sacred thread just for the sake of it.” \(i.e. for the sake of formality of *śāstra*\)

Even if one were to wear it just for the sake of *śāstra*, discipline, seriousness, devotion and modalities are a must. Otherwise it amounts to a drama of wearing the sacred with indifference and ostentation. It can be O.K. if at least a new sacred thread is put on, in the case of those who are unable to take up any ritual because of extreme difficulties. If time permits it is better such persons observe the other precepts of *Upākarma* and *utsarjana* at least briefly. With that they can at least have the auspicious remembrance of the *Ṛshis* and *devatās*. And some day the sense of duty to do *Vedādhyayana* to the possible extent in future, may awaken in *samskāris* \(persons with good impressions\). So, the *utsarjana* and *Upākarma vidhis* should never be given up as unnecessary.

1. We can find that *śāstras* prescribe that *Brahmacāris* should compulsorily have a haircut on account of *Upākarma*.

This sacred act of *vāpana* \(haircut\) is called *Āyushkarma* in our country \(an act which increases one’s life span\). The *Jyotiśśāstra* lays down the rule that it has to be done only on certain days, *tithis* and *nakshatras*.

> कुर्वीत बुध सोमयोः  
> मन्देऽभ्यङ्गं भृगौ क्षौरं ग्रहणेपि न दुष्यति 

Hair cut is prohibited on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In the same way *Pūrṇima* is prohibited for those who are in the *āshramas* of householders and *Brahmacāris,* who wish long life. As we have noted earlier, *Upākarma* for *yajurvedi* falls on *Pūrṇima Tithi* only. Sometimes it may fall on a Tuesday or a Saturday also. Then is it correct that the *śāstras* make a rule that *Brahmacāris* should have a hair cut on the day of *Upākarma*, if that day comes under the list of prohibited days, some may ask. It should be noted that *śāstras* declare that *Brahmacāris* should have haircut on that day, without worrying about the *Kāladosha*, as the haircut has been ordained by the *śāstras*

वैधे कर्मणि सम्प्राप्ते कालदोषं न चिन्तयेत् \(वसिष्ठस्मृति\)

How can the harmful effect of the inauspicious *Tithi* and *vāra* vanish just because it is permitted by the scriptures? some may ask. The answer is, the powerful auspicious effect of *Upākarma* will wipe out the above harmful effect and will cause a special auspicious effect on them.

Lay persons may object—“Why should one consider the *tithi, vāra* and *nakshatra* to have a hair cut? After all, the hair gets removed no matter what day it is done”. We remember an incident here.

It was the time when the British had complete domination over India. The British occupied all the top posts in authority. A *Brahmacāri* was holding a good post in one such office. He did not have a facial shave for several days. He had postponed the *haircut* to *Upākarma,* which was nearing by a day or two. His head and face were covered with hair. The English officer had a lot of affection for him. The *Brahmacāri* also had a lot of respect and love for the officer, and enjoyed some freedom with him. One day, observing his bearded face, the officer asked him.

“Why haven’t you had a facial shave? You have dirt all over your face”?

“I had a bath just now and I have washed my face well sir. It is clean only. There is not even a little dirt.”

“Your face is covered with hair. Don’t you think it is dirt?”

“How can clean hair be dirt Sir?”

“Then what it is but dirt”?

“Then why is that you have hair on your head. Why haven’t you had your head shaven completely, as it is also dirt?

“That is not dirt. I have washed my head well and applied scent on it”.

“I have also washed my face well. The hair on it has no dirt. It is all clean, Sir”.

The officer had to answer, but just smiled and kept quiet.

“Why should one have a haircut? If hair is washed regularly it will always be clean. Doesn’t it give protection to the skull and facial skin?”, one may ask. Yes it is true. But if the hair on the face is allowed to grow too much, it causes inconvenience. One has to take the trouble of cleaning it well every day. Further, the parts of the body which all people wish to look attractive, get covered by hair. Thus, from the point of view of both convenience and appearance, it is better to get it shaved, we wish to say. This is something agreeable to the lay man. But we see strange statements in our *śāstras* like if one has the hair cut according to precepts, it increases the life span. And if hair cut is had on forbidden days in forbidden places and in forbidden ways, there could be danger to the person and also to his parents, brothers and other close relatives, say the *śāstras* and traditions. We feel that this is just a result of superstition. We hear from traditional families that if hair cut is had on Fridays there will danger to the mother, if hair cut is had on Thursdays the elder brother will be in danger. But we find that the mothers and elder brothers of many who deliberately get their hair cut on forbidden days, are safe and happy. So it can be proved that there is no relation between hair cut, *Tithi, vāra* and *nakshatra* etc. “This is the charge of the rationalists. But we wish to say that the critics of this belief have not correctly grasped the opinion of the scriptural statements. The *śāstras* do not intend to state that danger to the life of the person having a hair cut on forbidden days and to his kin is certain. Their opinion is that it may create a condition of nature with proclivity to danger and may tend to lead to the path of some danger. It is possible that they can get out of danger inspite of such a would-be-danger possibility, either because of their past merits or even by the power of good deeds done thereafter. Just as every living being is stalked by forces which may cause harm, there are forces that give protection also. A conflict always exists between these forces in nature. The force that is more strong \(at the particular context\), triumphs. If rituals are performed during prohibited times and places, destructive forces get nourished. So, one should not indulge in deeds which nourish destructive forces, with the \(casual\) feeling that protective forces are there anyhow. For example, health may get affected if a person moves around in minimum clothing during biting cold. But it may not affect some who are robust. By this, one should not conclude that there is no relation between health and cold environs. Again, many people may get affected, if they happen to be in the environs of contagious epidemics like cholera. Some people may survive in spite of such environs. So, it is not wise to move around in an environment of contagious diseases. Some hazards may not affect immediately but may cause trouble later, acting like slow poison. It has to be established only scientifically, whether they cause danger immediately or in course of time. Their existence \(or otherwise\) should not be decided by results seen by the mere eyes at that moment.

“Does the hair cut had by a person on the forbidden days of *Tithi, vāra* and *nakshatra* bring about undesirable changes, subtle or gross, in the nerves, *nāḍis* and brain etc. of the body or the *saptadhātus*? Has it brought about any undesirable results in the *Ādhibautika, Ādhyātmika* and *Ādhidaivika* spheres? Is any undesirable reaction detected immediately or later, in that person’s disposition? Does the person possess the ability to stop such undesirable results or ward off such undesirable effects?” — These matters should be evaluated scientifically, and then only a conclusion can be drawn. Without such a study one should not come to a hasty conclusion based on what is seen by the mere eyes, and infer that there is no relation between the time and *karma,* such as—“He had his hair cut on Friday. But his mother is still alive.” etc.

The *Nāḍīvijnāna* \(The science of the *nāḍīs*\) tells us that there is a relation between the act of hair cutting and the *Tithi*, *vāra, nakshatra*. So, it is safer to avoid a hair cut on such forbidden days. If hair cut becomes unavoidable on such forbidden days, the undesirable effects should be allayed by due *Śāntikarma* etc., and, a hair cut should be had again, at an auspicious time.

Also, one should make a study and find out whether any good results are obtained by having a hair cut on a good vāra, *Tithi* and whether health improves and longevity of life gets increased. ***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru*** used to give an example to substantiate the point that having a haircut on best days is helpful for the enhancement of health and lifespan of a person. “Grown up trees and plants will gain in health and life span, if they are cut properly at the right time and at the right part \(of their body\) and thereafter they grow richly. This we see in nature, and the same applies to human beings also.”

To this a disciple of the ***Mahāguru*** said — In Russia people get their hair cut even on forbidden days. Yet they live longer than our countrymen. On the other hand, in India even people who get their hair cut on auspicious days do not live long. So there is no connection between *kālaśuddhi* \(auspicious time-day\) and hair cut”. We remember what ***ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru*** had told in this regard. He said. “The reason for the longevity of the people of Russia is their body, country, nature, their food habits and the physical exercises etc, and not just because they have their hair cut on prohibited days. The dos and don’ts regarding Ayushkarma are not the same for all the countries and people of all natures. One should not conclude by just one or two incidents that are superficially visible to the eyes.”

Even If *Upākarma* falls on a Saturday or a Tuesday or on a *Pūrṇima Tithi, Brahmacāris* should have *Ayushkarma* on that day itself. As the forces that nourish their dispositions are powerful on that day, the evil forces cannot cause any harm to them. By wearing the new *kaupīna, ajina,* new *yajnopavīta* and *danḍa*, the enthusiasm of freshness which is necessary for *vedārambha* sets in them.

2. “These days people do not study the *vedas* at all. When such is the case, is it not useless to observe *Upākarma* and *utsarjana* for a day or two in a year? Just as they have given up the study of the *vedas*, is it not an honest step to give up *Upākarma* itself? — “This is another question.

The answer to this question is as follows: “anyhow they have to perform upākarma. It is better to understand it’s secret and significance, and perform it meaningfully. Then it provides an inspiration to *Vedādhyayana*, the origin of *upākarma*, to the extent possible.

On seeing a sick person one should not say”—Any how this man is ill. Why should he be reminded of a good state of health?” Why should he be given emendations related to good health? So, he should not be neglected. *Upākarma* is an auspicious *parva* which reminds the necessity of studying the *Vedas*. Persons who have the right to do *Adhyayana* should observe it to the best of their capacity.

3. “These days people do not have enough time to perform *Upākarma* elaborately in the prescribed way. So can it be shortened.?”

Our answer to this is as follows:-

“One has to find enough time to perform such an important rite in the prescribed manner. If enough time does not become available due to unavoidable reasons, *Upākarma* must be performed at least briefly in the available time. At least the most important parts of it have to be observed. People do not give up eating food for the reason that they do not have enough time. They take their food within the time available and protect their bodies. In the same way, *Upākarma* must be observed in keeping with their ability at least briefly, for the sake of guarding *Ātmasamskāra*. While doing so, one should have the discrimination as to what is principal and what is secondary. The most important part of *Upākarma* is the beginning of the study of the *vedas*. As a part of it, *Ṛshis* are offered worship, *tarpaṇa* and *homa*. The Wearing of a new sacred thread etc. enhances that. Those who have time constraints, should put on new *yajnopavīta*, remember the *Ṛshis* and chant with devotion the beginning *anuvākas* of their *vedaśākhas* and auspiciously conclude the rite of *Upākarma*. At least this much must be observed.

4. On *Śrāvaṇa Kṛshṇa Prathamā, Gāyatrī Japa* is done specially. It is called *Gāyatrī* festival. Is *Gāyatrī* festival a part of *Upākarma* or is it a different ritual?

Answer:- It is not a part of *Upākarma*. Still it is a very important ritual which is related to the study of *the vedas* like *Upākarma*.

Those who cannot observe *Upākarma* in a certain year because of *pitṛdīksha* etc., must perform \(japa\) of *Gāyatrī mantra* or *homa*. In this way, even though *“Gāyatrī”* is not a part of *Upākarma*, still it is a very important rite related to the study of the *vedas*. It is an atonement-rite for a lapse called *mithyādhyayana. Mithyādhyayana* means a false study and a wasteful study. It is a study giving undesirable result instead of the intended good result. *Mithyādhyayana* is studying what is not be studied, and doing the mandatory *Adhyayana* in the manner which is not *śāstriya*. This is an offence against *vedamāta* \(mother of *vedas*\). To overcome this blemish, *Gāyatrī* should be specially remembered on that day. *Gāyatrī Japa* and homa etc should be done. *Gāyatrī mantra Japa* should be done numbering either one thousand and eight times, or one hundred and eight times etc, as prescribed. It should be done with enthusiasm, devotion and concentration. It is an offence to speed up reciting *mantras* just to reach the required number.

This *Gāyatrī pūja* is an important *parva*. It is a *parva* related to the rainy season, or the first *parva* of the new year . One should stay at the same place where *Upākarma* was observed, and the following day the real study of the *Vedas* should to be done to one’s capacity. One should not travel to another place on the following day of *Gāyatrī parva.*





	 
## Utthānadvādaśī

### The importance of *Kārtikamāsa*

The most famous festival in the month of *Kārtika* is *Utthānadvādaśī*.

As is evident from the lines

“कार्तिके ज्ञानसिद्धिः स्यात्” कार्तिके तु कृता दीक्षा नृणां जन्मविमोचिनी”

the entire month of *Kārtika* is conducive to *jnānasiddhi* and *mantradīkshā svīkāra*. And, as evident from

“ज्ञानं महेश्वरादिच्छेत्”, all the Mondays of this month are very dear to Lord *Śiva* who is renowned as the deity who bestows *jnāna*. *Kārtika śukla navamī* is the day stipulated to perform *Vishṇutrirātra vrata*. *Kārtika śukla Caturdaśī* known as *Vaikunṭha Caturdaśī* is best for the worship of *vaikunṭha Nārāyaṇa*, and again well known as the day of installation of *Viśveśvara*, is best for the worship of *Śiva* also. *Kārtika pūrṇima* known as the day of *Matsyāvatāra* is excellent for the worship of *Nārāyaṇa*, and, also known as the day of *Tripurotsava*, is excellent for the worship of *Śiva*. “पौर्णमास्यां तु सन्ध्यायां कर्तव्यस्त्रिपुरोत्सवः”

> वरान् दत्त्वा यतो विष्णुर्मत्स्यरूप्यभवत्ततः।   
> तस्यां दत्तं हुतं जप्तं तदव्ययफलं भवेत्॥ \(पाद्मकार्तिकमाहात्म्य\) 

There is also a custom of celebrating *dīpotsava* on *Kārtika Amāvāsya* in some places. On *Kārtika śuddha Ekādaśī, Bhishmapañcaka vrata* is observed. This is the best month to wear the garland of beads made from the stem of *Tulasī*, after offering it to *Nārāyaṇa* and worshipping it.

> निवेद्य केशवे मालां तुलसीकाष्ठसम्भवाम् ।   
> तुलसीकाष्ठसम्भूते माले कृष्णजनप्रिये॥   
> बिभर्मि त्वामहम् कण्ठे कुरु मां कृष्णवल्लभम् 

*Kārtika śuddha dvādaśi* and *pūrṇima* also happen to be the holy *manvādis*. Thus, *utthāna dvādaśi* is the most renowned day in the month of *Kārtika* which again is excellent for *Sādhakās* of *Bhakti* and *jnāna*.

### The Name

This day is called *Utthānadvādaśī*, and the day previous to it is called *Prabodhinī* or *Devotthāpinī* \(in Hindi it is *Devaṭhan* or *Diṭhavan*\) *Ekādaśī*. *Utthāna* means getting up. Here it means waking up from sleep. This has come to be known as *Utthāna dvādaśī*, as it is the day on which Lord *Nārāyaṇa* quitting his sleep, shows the *Mudrā* of waking up to the devotees. *Prabodhana* means awakening. *Utthāpana* means waking up. The day on which devotees sing *Suprabhāta maṅgala* to the Lord and wake him up from sleep is *prabodhinī* or *Utthāpinī tithi*. This service of waking up is done on *Ekādaśī* by some, and on *dvādaśī* by some others. As it happens to be the day on which God gets up from his good sleep in the ocean of milk, it is also called *“Kshīrābdhivrata”*.

### When should this *vrata* be celebrated?

*Pāraṇa* should be done as a part of the festival on the day of *Kārtikaśuddhadvādaśī* when there is no *yoga* of the star *Revatī*. If such a day is not available, at least the fourth *pāda* of *Revatī* should be given up.

**Procedures for observance.**

		
This *parva* is observed in different parts of the country in different ways, briefly and also in detail. The common features in all these are *Vishṇu pūja*, and the worshipping of *Tulasī* along with *Dhātrī* \(the plant of gooseberry\) and *Vishṇu*.

> एकादश्यां तु शुक्लायां कार्तिके मासि केशवम् ।   
> प्रसुप्तं बोधयेद्रात्रौ श्रद्धाभक्तिसमन्वितः॥ \(ब्राह्म\)  
> पारणाहे पूर्वरात्रे घण्टादीन्वादयेन्मुहुः। \(रामार्चनचन्द्रिका\) 

*Nirṇaya Sindhu* a treatise on *Dharmaśāstra*, renders the procedures of the *vratas* as follows:

*Ekādaśī vrata* should be observed on *Kārtikaśuddha Ekādaśī* and a *Kumbhadāna* should be done in the morning.

“प्रातर्दत्त्वा शुभान् कुम्भान् प्रयाति हरिमन्दिरम्”

If it is a *Monday* with *uttarāshāḍhānakshatra,* it is very auspicious. Some say that *Śrī Keśavasvamī* should be woken up on the night of *Ekādaśī* itself and some others say it should be done on *dvādaśī*. This can be observed as per the prevailing custom of the place.

Lord *Nārāyaṇa* should be woken up chanting “इदं विष्णुर्विचक्रमे.” Prayers of *Suprabhāta* to the Lord should be sung with the following *ślokas*-

> ब्रह्मेन्द्र रुद्राग्नि कुबेर सूर्य सोमादिभिर्वन्दित वन्दनीय ।   
> बुद्ध्यस्व देवेश जगन्निवास मन्त्रप्रभावेण सुखेन देव ॥ 

> इयं तु द्वादशी देव प्रबोधार्थं विनिर्मिता ।   
> त्वयैव सर्वलोकानां हितार्थं शेषशायिना ॥ 

> उत्तिष्ठोतिष्ठ गोविन्द त्यज निद्राम् जगत्पते ।   
> त्वयि सुप्ते जगन्नाथ जगत्सुप्तम् भवेदिदम् ॥ 

> उत्थिते चेष्टते सर्वं उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ माधव ।   
> उत्तिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ गोविन्द उत्तिष्ठ गरुडध्वज ।   
> उत्तिष्ठ कमलाकान्त त्रैलोक्यं मङ्गलम् कुरु ॥ 

> गता मेघा वियच्चैव निर्मलं निर्मला दिशः ।   
> शारदानि च पुष्पाणि गृहाण मम केशव ॥ 

\(“O worshipful *Deveśa*, you are the one worshipped by *Brahma*, *Indra, Rudra, Agni, Kubera, Sūrya, Soma* and other gods. Please wake up, O *Jagannivāsa* \! please wake up pleasantly listening to the *mantras*. O *Śeshaśāyi* \! you have created this *dvādaśi* for the well-being of all the people of the world and for your own awakening. O *Govinda* \! please get up. Give up sleep. O\! Lord of the world\! if you sleep the whole world sleeps. If you wake up the world will be full of activity. You are the *caitanya* who causes the movement of the *Jaḍa*. O\! *Lakshmīramaṇa* \! Please get up, Clouds have vanished, the sky is clear. All the directions have become clear. Please accept these beautiful and fragrant flowers of this season of *Śaratkāla*”\). Then, in front of the Lord, the auspicious conclusion for *Cāturmāsya* must be performed.

“O Lord *Janārdana* \! May the *Cāturmāsya* observed by me please you\! May the deficiencies that have occurred in this \(*vrata*\) \(get redeemed\) and may \(this *vrata*\) become *Paripūrṇa* \! by your grace.

> इदम् व्रतम् मया देव कृतम् प्रीत्यै तव प्रभो।   
> न्यूनं सम्पूर्णताम् यातु त्वत्प्रसादाज्जनार्दन॥ 

On the night of *Ekādaśī*, a blackgram sized golden idol of *Matsya* should be placed in a *kumbha*. After *pañcāmṛta abhisheka*, worship should be performed with *kuṅkuma kesari* and *Pitāmbara*. All the ten *avatāras* such as *Matsya* should to be worshipped. Keeping awake in the night, all gods and *ācāryas* should be worshipped in the morning. “जगदादिरनादिमान् । जगदाद्यो जगद्योनिः प्रीयतां मे जनार्दनः” ॥

\(“May Lord *Janārdana*, who is the prime cause of the world, who is *Jagadrūpa*, who has no beginning and who is the origin of the world be pleased with me.\) With this prayer, he should be saluted and Brāhmins should be worshipped with the offering of *dakshiṇā*.

“The king should install the woken up God in a chariot and take HIM in a procession, to the tune of music. He should gift those things which were chosen for the observance of *Niyamās* to Brāhmins along with *dakshiṇā*, after informing them about those things.

> चातुर्मास्यव्रतानां च समाप्तिः कार्तिके स्मृता \(नारदीय\)  
> कार्तिके शुक्लपक्षे तु द्वादश्यां तत्समापयेत् \(महाभारत\) 

This *pūja* should be done even if *śukrā* has set. If the devotee is contracted by *aśauca*, the *pūja* should be gotten done by others.

In addition to this, *Dharmasindhu* tells us how to worship the God of Gods at the foot of the gooseberry tree.

“O *Dāmodara,* I prostrate before you. Please accept *arghya* and grant us all our desires. Let my progeny be imperishable.”

Then, with the *śloka*

> अर्ध्यं गृहाण भगवन् सर्वकामप्रदो भव।   
> अक्षया सन्ततिर्मेऽस्तु दामोदर नमोऽस्तु ते॥ 

*arghya* should be offered to the god of gods who is worshipped with *Shoḍaśopacāra pūjās. Dhātrī* \(i.e. the gooseberry tree which is presided over by *Dhātrī devī*\) should be worshiped with sandal paste and flowers etc, and *arcana* should be performed with the *Nāmavaḷis* viz. *Dhātri, Śanti, Medhā, Prakṛti, Vishṇupatnī, Mahālakshmī, Ramyā, Kamalā, Indirā, Lokamātā, Kalyāṇī, Kamanīyā, Sāvitrī, Jagaddhatrī, Gāyatrī, Sudhṛti, Avyaktā, Viśvarūpā, Surūpā and Abdhibhavā. Then in the prācīnāvīti* position, *pitṛtarpaṇa* should be done at the foot of the *Dhātrī* tree. The *mantra* for the *Tarpaṇa* is

> पिता पितामहश्चान्ये अपुत्रा ये च गोत्रिणः।   
> ते पिबन्तु मया दत्तं धात्रीमूलेऽक्षयम् पयः॥ 

Then a cord should be tied around that tree chanting the *śloka*:-

> दामोदरनिवासिन्यै धात्र्यै देव्यै नमोस्तु ते।   
> सूत्रेणानेन बध्नामि सर्वदेवनिवासिनीम्॥ 

“O *Devi*, you reside in all gods. *Dāmodara* resides in you and we offer our salutations to you. O *Dhātri* \! I bind you with this *sūtra*.”

There is a custom of performing *Tulasī vivāha* here, along with the celebration of the awakening of *MahāVishṇu. Shoḍaśopacāra pūjās* should be performed to *Śrī Bhagavān* and *Tulasī Devī*. Services should be offered to God with *Purushasūkta* and to *Śrī Tulasī* with *Śrī Sūkta* and other *śloka*s. The offering of *Maṅgalasnāna* and *haridrākuṅkumārpaṇa* to *Śrī Tulasī Devī* may be done by *Sumaṅgalis*. There is a custom of offering *pūja* to the Lord by chanting the *mantras* -“इदं विष्णुः, चरणं पवित्रम्” and योजागार”. An idol of *Śrī Kṛshṇa* is placed in front of *Śrī Tulasī Devī*, and a curtain is held between the two. The *Maṅgalāshṭaka śloka*s are recited and the *antarapata* is removed. Then *ārdrākshatā* is sprinkled on both, and *Tulasī* is placed in the hands of *Damodara,* and chanting the *śloka*

> देवीम् कनकसम्पन्नां कनकाभरणैर्युताम् ।   
> दास्यामि विष्णवे तुभ्यम् ब्रह्मलोकजिगीषया ॥ 

\(I am offering as *dāna* this *Tulasīdevī* who is full of gold and adorned with golden ornaments to you who is *Vishṇu* himself, for the attainment of *Brahmaloka*\). She should be given as *dāna* with *Śobhanākshatā* and water. God should be requested with the words—

“May you accept this *Devī *” and then making *Tulasī* to touch the hand of God, the hymns of marriage viz. - “क इदं कस्मा अदात्” etc should be recited?

“O *Tulasī Devi,* kindly stay on my left, on my right, in front of me and at my back. Let me attain *moksha* by offering you \(in marriage to *Dāmodara*\)”

> त्वं देवि मेऽग्रतो भूयाः तुलसीदेवि पार्श्वतः।   
> देवि त्वं पृष्ठतो भूयाः त्वद्दानान्मोक्षमाप्नुयाम् ॥ 

Praying thus, *dakshiṇās* should be offered for the virtuousness of *Dāna. Śanti sūkta* and *Vishṇu sūkta* should be chanted. Then *maṅgalārati* to *MahāVishṇu* with *Tulasī* should be performed, and the devotee should circumambulate four times with his retinue. *Brāhmins* should be offered *dakshiṇā*, and with a *Saṅkalpa* they should be fed, in keeping with the ability \(of the devotee\).

There is also a *vidhi* which is observed as per the precepts in the *Brahmavaivarta purāṇa*. In that observance, a *Saṅkalpa* is made that *Shoḍaśopacāra pūja* will be offered to *Śrī Kṛshṇa* along with *Tulasī* with the materials kept ready to one’s ability, and the following are observed:— *Kalaśapūjā* and *Śrī Gaṇapati pūjā* are done and then *Praṇapratishṭā* is done in the idol and *Śrī Kṛshṇa* with *Tulasī* is invoked and installed at the foot of the *Tulasī* plant. *Shoḍaśopacāra pūjās* are offered with *Purushasūkta*, *Śrī Sūkta* and *Upacāra ślokas*. In the worship, *aṅgapūja* and *ashṭottarapūjas* should be offered to *Śrī Kṛshṇa* and *Śrī Tulasī*. \(At the end\) all these *karmas* should be offered to God and goddess.

		
Then *pūja* should be offered to *Dhātrīdevī* the presiding deity of gooseberry, *Śrī Tulasīdevi* and the presiding deity of the *Tulasī* plant, supposing them as the *Vibhutis* of *Lakshmīdevī.* Other than offering them *pūjā* separately, they should be offered *pūja* along with *Śrī Kṛshṇa* also.

There is also a custom of placing *Śrī Kṛshṇa’s* idol between the *Tulasī* plant and the goosberry stem that has fresh gooseberry fruits and worshipping it. It is excellent to light a lamp which is made by carving a cup in the gooseberry and filling it with cow’s ghee. The practice of using gingelly oil is also there, when cow’s ghee becomes unavailable.

There is also a custom of doing *pūjā* and *paranā* in the morning, and performing *Tualsī pūja* and *Tulasī vivāha* in the evening.

On the day of *Kārtika śuddha Ekādaśī*, *Bhīshmapañcaka vrata* is observed for five days. One has to observe silence to do this *vrata* and Lord *Vishṇu* should be given a bath with *pañcāmṛta* and *pañcagavya*, and *pāyasa* should be offered as *naivedya* and *dvādaśākshara mahāmantra* or *shaḍakshara mahāmantra* should be chanted. On all the five days one should observe *brahmacarya* and should eat food suitable for the sages, and *arghya* should be offered to *Bhīshma*. The *mantra*

“सत्यव्रताय शुचये गाङ्गेयाय महात्मने । भीष्मायैतद्ददाम्यरर्ध्यं आजन्मब्रह्मचारिणे ॥ वैयाध्रपद्य गोत्राय” should be chanted and *tarpaṇa* should be offered in the *prācīnāvītī* position. As this *vrata* happens to fall on *utthānadvādaśi* also, it is included here. We would like to answer some important questions pertaining to this observance.

Question 1: The word *Utthānadvādaśīi means the dvādaśītithi* on which Lord *Vishṇu* ware’s up from sleep, and accordingly, the precept of singing the praise of *Suprabhāta maṇgala* for the Lord has been explained. If it is the day of waking up of God, it suggests that he was asleep earlier. Is this supposition correct?

Ans: Yes, it is correct. Only on the supposition that god adorns sleep for a period of four months called *Cāturmāsya*, this *suprabhāta* is sung on the above said day.

Question 2: If god were to be really asleep for four months like that, how does the activities of the world go on? Isn’t God the cause for all activities of the world?

Ans: There is no doubt that all the activities of nature go on at HIS instance and in HIS presidentship. In the present context, though God appears to be asleep for some reason, *Prakṛti Devī* herself, being bestowed with strength by HIM, and receiving HIS orders, can carry out all the activities of the world during that time. There is no contradiction in this.

Question 3: Let us agree that God bestows upon *Prakṛti* the strength and impulsion to carry out the work. But does God really sleep at that time is the question. During sleep we don’t remember anything. No memory of decisions made before will be there. One can’t know what is going on in the world. If God really sleeps, does he forget his responsibilities, the state of the world and other things?

Ans: It is not correct to compare divine sleep with the sleep of mortals. It is a special kind of sleep. The Lord, is ever vigilant in the protection of the world, though he sports the *mudrā* of sleep. That is why the devotees describe him thus:—

“निद्रामुद्रां निखिलजगतीरक्षणे जागरूकाम्”. There will be no forgetfulness in that sleep. No attachment, no inertness and not an iota of ignorance. There are no *vikāras* also in his sleep.

> न वै लेशेनापि प्रसरति तमो नात्र विकृतिः।   
> न मोहो नो जाड्यम् 

In that sleep the body does not lose its lustre as is the case with mortals. His *divyamaṅgala vigraha* keeps shining with incomparable beauty and charm. For this very reason, the *jnānis* have described that divine posture as “निद्रामुद्राभिरामम्”

In reality it is not a sleep caused by nature. It is only a posture of sleep taken by God by his own *Saṅkalpa*. If it were to be a real sleep, how could he be aware of the worship and prayer we offer at that time?

		
Question 4: Why should *Bhagavān* sport this posture of sleep?

Ans: The lord has to take to that posture also, as there are devotees of different tastes and different states of mind. Some devotees feel happy to see him in the sitting posture. Some feel happy to see him in the standing posture. Yet others take delight in seeing him in the sleeping posture. The Lord shows them the sleeping posture, only to shower grace on them.

भङ्गीभेदा भवतो ध्यानानन्दाय विविधभक्तानाम्

Question 5: Is there any proof in the *śāstras* to state that he does not get inertia etc in the sleeping posture?

Ans: *Śāstra* is nothing but a delineation of the reality. It has to be understood by the experiences of the *jnānis*. The *Pāñcarātrāgama* describes the signifiance of that sleep as follows: The Lord is not affected by inertia even though he sports the sleeping posture. His sleep is not like the sleep of mortals whose minds get impure as they are overcome by nature. He is ever awake. He is omniscient, eternal, unborn and the supreme Lord. States like sleep etc are under his control and not the other way.

> वासुदेवो जगन्नाथः क्रियार्थं स्वेच्छया द्विज।   
> सेवमानोऽपि तां निद्राम् जडतां न व्रजेत्प्रभुः॥ 

> यथा प्राकृतिकस्सुप्तः कश्चिन्मलिनमानसः।   
> यतः प्रबुद्धः सर्वज्ञः नित्योऽजः परमेश्वरः।   
> तस्य निद्रादयो दोषाः सततं यान्ति वश्यताम् ॥ 

Question 6: Do *śāstras* state that he accepts *nidrā mudrā* to bless the devotees?

Ans: Yes, very clearly indeed. *Āgamaśāstra* makes us understand this through a story. The story is as follows: Long ago *yoganidrādevī* pleased God by performing a penance. She implored, *“Bhagavan*, please make me included in your person \(body\).” “Yes”, said the lord and looked at his own divine auspicious body. He had *Lakshmī* on his *vakshsthala* and no place was there. The conch and the disc and others had adorned the arms. So no place was there. He thought of giving some space below his navel, but it was occupied by *Garuḍa* his vehicle. The head was adorned by the crown and the ear by the earrings. There was empty space only in the eyes. He said “come, you can happily stay here for four months.” Thus he gave space to *Nidrādevī* in his eyes. She was thrilled with ecstasy and just obeyed the words of God.

> पुरा तपःप्रभावेन तोषितो योगनिद्रया।   
> मामङ्गमानयस्वेति प्रार्थितो जगताम् पतिः॥ 

> निरीक्ष्य चात्मनो देहे रुद्धं लक्ष्म्या उरःस्थलम् ।   
> देवस्य शङ्खचक्राद्यैः बाहवस्सु विभूषिताः॥ 

> अधो नाभेर्निरुद्धं च वैनतेयेन पक्षिणा।   
> मुकुटेन शिरो रुद्धं कुण्डलाभ्यां श्रवोर्युगम् ॥ 

> ततो ददौ तु सन्तुष्टो नेत्रयोः स्थानमादरात्।   
> चतुरो वार्षिकान्मासान् वासं प्रीता भविष्यसि॥ 

> योगनिद्रापि तद्वाक्यं श्रुत्वा हृष्टतनूरुहा।   
> चकार लोचनावासमत्यर्थं शार्ङ्गधन्वनः॥ 

In this way God blesses *Yoganidrādevī* for four months and then blesses *Jāgradavasthādevi* on the day of *Utthānadvādaśī.* He blesses the devotees to offer the *suprabhāta seva* also, say the *purāṇas* and *Itihāsas*. Our National poet *Kāḷidāsa* also indicates this in his work *Meghasandeśa*.

शापान्तो मे भुजगशयनादुत्थिते शार्ङ्गपाणौ

Question 7: Why should the Lord choose those four months only for the *yoganidrā mudrā*?

Ans: Those four months come in the rainy season. Nature will not be conducive to external activities like travel etc. Nature will not be friendly for journey of universal conquests. It is not easy to engage oneself in farming, trade and commerce. Even the daily travel of *Sanyāsis* is also not easy. It is said that swans find it very difficult to live in this climate and they migrate to the lake *Mānasa* which is their abode. In the same way, it is the right time *Hamsas* and *Praṇahamsa sanyāsis* to stop their external journey, and to enter their *mānasa* \(heart\) *sarovara* and experience *yoganidrā*. It is the time for the people of all *āśramas* to have rest. So this time is earmarked for them to suspend most of their external activities and engage themselves in *pūjā* and *dhyāna,* and obtain peace in God. As God adorns *Yoganidrā* at that time, it facilitates others also to obtain a divine state by meditating upon him and worshipping him.

If one cannot afford to be in the state of rest for all the four months fully, he should rest at least for the first two months when rains are heavy, and the Lord sleeping in *Yoganidrā* should be worshipped. \(A devotee\) should sleep along with Him and wake up with Him. When the Lord goes to sleep, the whole world sleeps and when He wakes up, the world also wakes up. When He is asleep, we should also restrain our senses and try to have *yoganidrā* like Him. We should practice *Yama, niyama* and *Samyama*, and accumulate spiritual power. During that period no celebrations such as *cūḍākarma, Vratabandha, devatāpratishṭhā, Upanayana* and *Vivāha* should be performed. Only the inner activities such as meditation and worship should be attended to. After *Suprabhāta* is offered to God, and after getting his permission, outward activities conforming to His *Satyakāma* and *Satyasaṅkalpa* should be begun. Thus, for the sake of the good of his devotees only, God assumes *Yoganidrā* in that distinguished period, and, opening his eyes blossomed like a beautiful flower he blesses the devotees, the *śāstras* say—

> सुप्ते त्वयि जगन्नाथ जगत्सुप्तं भवेदिदम्।   
> प्रबुद्धे त्वयि बुद्ध्येत जगत्सर्वं चराचरम्॥ 

> तस्यैवाग्रे स्वयं वाचा गृहणीयान्नियामान्नरः।   
> चतुरो वार्षिकान्मासान् देवस्योत्थापनावधि॥ 

> निद्रादिदोषरहिते प्रसुप्ते ह्यच्युतेऽमले।   
> निवर्तन्ते क्रियास्सर्वाः चातुर्वर्ण्यस्य सर्वशः॥ 

> विवाहव्रतबन्धादि चूडासंस्कारदीक्षणम्।   
> यज्ञो गृहप्रवेशादि गोदानार्चाप्रतिष्ठनम्॥ 

> पुण्यानि यानि कर्माणि वर्जयेद्दक्षिणायने।   
> त्वयि प्रबुद्धे देवेश तवाग्रे परमेश्वर॥ 

> लौकिकानीह यज्ञानि तानि निर्वर्तयाम्यहम्।   
> योगनिद्रां निषेवस्व देव मासचतुष्टयम्॥   
> सर्वलोकहितार्थाय कृतार्थी कुरु नः प्रभो। 

Question 8: On the day of *Utthānadvādaśi*, the Lord is offered a garland of gooseberries. People plant and worship that tree. They pour cow’s ghee into its cup, and light the lamps. They do *dīpadāna*. They take bath after applying \(crushed\) gooseberries to the body or water mixed with the pulp gooseberries. Preparing *Nellichettu* out of it, they offer it to God as *Naivedya* and consume it First just after *Praṇāhuti* during the meal.

Why so much of importance is given to goosebery?

Ans: Gooseberry is highly valued as it is endowed with many great qualities. It is a very great substance when viewed from the *ādhibhautika*, *ādhidaivika* and *ādhyātmik*a angles also. The very names viz., *Śrīphalā, dhātrī, āmalakī, amṛta, Śivā*, *śāntā*, *vṛshyā* and *rocanī* sing its glory. It is a true form of *Śrī* Devi and it blesses the devotee with fortunes. It is *Brahmaśakti svarūpiṇi,* and is considered a mother who bears and nourishes. It is born of pure water and it’s sourness is most pure. It provides *amṛtattva*. It is auspicious. Causes calmness. It helps in enhancing virility, and is tasty—These are the respective meanings.

Question 9: The names are beautiful. How do *śāstras* describe it’s glory?

Ans: The *śāstras* declare that it’s glory is beyond description and give a brief account of it as follows:

		
*“Dhātri* in the real sense of the word, is a nurse \(ie. A mother who bears and nourishes\) to human beings. It has a motherly affection towards human beings. The consumption of its juice enhances the life span of a person. Taking a bath with it causes the accumulation of *dharma*. It destroys *Alakshmī* \(poverty\) and blesses with *Moksha* at the end. Taking a bath with it helps in crossing the hurdles. It has all the great qualities of *Tulasī* and *bilva*.

> धात्री वत्स नृणां धात्री मातृवत्कुरुते दयाम्।   
> दद्यादायुः पयःपानात् स्नानाद्वै धर्मसञ्चयम्॥ 

> अलक्ष्मीनाशनम् सद्योऽप्यन्ते निर्वाणमेव च।   
> विध्नानि नैव जायन्ते धात्रीस्नानेन वै नृणाम्॥ 

> बिल्वस्य च तुलस्याश्च ये गुणाः कथितास्सखि।   
> ते ते गुणास्सर्व एव आमलक्यां समाहिताः॥ 

O *Āmalakī Devi*, you are adorned with row of leaves and others. I prostrate before you. You are dear to both *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*. You are full of wealth and your lustre is beautiful.

> नमाम्यामलकीं देवीं पत्रमालाद्यलङ्कृताम्।   
> शिवविष्णुप्रियां देवीम् श्रीमतीं सुन्दरप्रभाम्॥ 

All the three i.e.*Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Śiva* dwell in gooseberry. Therefore it should to be respected and worshipped. It should be revered. It is should be made famous. She is the one who blesses us with supreme bliss.

> ब्रह्मविष्णुशिवाश्चापि तत्राधिष्ठानमाश्रिताः।   
> जाता ह्यामलकी देवी परमानन्ददायिनी॥   
> मान्या ख्याप्या च पूज्या च प्रणन्तव्या सखी त्वियम्” 

She is dear to all *devas*, especially to *Nārāyaṇa*.

“सर्वदेवप्रिया ज्ञेया विष्णोश्चैव विशेषतः” \(बृहद्धर्मपुराण. 12\)

That she is dear to both *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* is elaborated in the same *purāṇa* \(canto 12\) in the form of a story as follows:-

To the question which tree is dear to both *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* that is equivalent to *Tulasī* and *Bilva*, *Pārvatī* the mother of the universe said. “There is only one tree which is very dear to both *Śiva* and *Vishṇu* in virtuousness just as *Tualsī* and *Bilva* are dear to them. It is *Āmalakī*. Both myself and *Śrī Lakshmī* brought it up. Once, during a pilgrimage, myself and *Lakshmī* and all the deities had assembled in the holy place of *Prabhāsa*. Both of us desired to worship God together. I wanted to worship *Nārāyaṇa* and *Lakshmī* wanted to worship *Śambhu*. I told *Lakshmi*” O *Samudra putri*, I want to worship *Nārāyaṇa* with an object created by me. *Lakshmī* with a choked voice said “I too have a similar wish. “I would like to worship *Śiva* \(three eyes\) with an object I have created,” Then tear drops rolled down from the eyes of both of us and fell on earth and a plant sprouted \(at that spot\), and that plant came to be known as *Āmalakī*. *‘Ka’* means water and *amala* means pure \(in Sanskrit\) and the one born from that \(pure water\) is *Āmalakī*. Then I worshipped Lord *Nārāyaṇa* with that in the presence of all the deities and sages, and *Lakshmī* worshipped *Śambhu*. Then proclamation of victory occurred from the earth. Abundant amount of flowers rained from heavens and the sound of conch was also heard.

> अनयोस्तुल्य एकः कः शिवविष्णुप्रियस्तरुः॥ 

> अस्ति बिल्वतुलसीतरुतुल्यः पुण्य एक उत विष्णुशिवार्हः।   
> नामतोऽमलक इत्यपि सख्यौ रोपितः कमलयाद्य मयापि॥

> सजये विजये देवि नावेवं भूतयोस्तदा॥ 

> नयनेषु सुजातानि अमलाश्रुजलानि च।   
> जाता नौ नयनेभ्यश्च निपेतुर्भुवि हे सखि॥

> आकाशे पुष्पवृष्टिश्च शङ्खशब्दाश्च पुष्कलाः।

> जाता ह्यामलकी देवी परमानन्ददायिनी।   
> मान्या ख्याप्या च पूज्या च प्रणन्तव्या सखी त्वियम् ॥ 

How did this holy tree come to be called *“Dhātrī?”* The same purāṇa says that *Āmalakīdevi* experienced happiness because *Gaurī* and *Lakshmī* performed the *pūjas* of *Vishṇu* and *Śiva*, using her \(i.e.*Āmalakī*\) and also because of the *jayajayakāra*, the blowing of the conch and the rain of flowers that occurred at that time. And so, she came to be called *Dhātrī*.

> दृष्ट्वा ह्यामलकी देवी दधारानन्दमुत्तमम्।   
> तेन धात्रीति नाम्नापि राजत्यामलकी शुभा॥ 

“The consorts of the trinity threw three seeds to wake up *Śrī Vishṇu*. From the seed thrown by *Dhātrī* \(i.e. *Brahma’s* consort *Sarasvatī*\) *Dhātrī* was born. From the seed thrown by *Ramādevī*, *Mālatī* was born and from the seed thrown by *Gaurī*, *Tulasī* was born” says *Śivapurāṇa*.

> धात्र्युद्भवा स्मृता धात्री माभवा मालती स्मृता।   
> गौरीभवा च तुलसी तमस्सत्त्वरजोगुणाः।   
> तं चापि तुलसी धात्री रागेनैवावलोकताम् ॥ \(रुद्रखण्ड अध्याय 26\) 

The etymology of the word *Dhātri* is also stated as, “the one by which all the *purushārthas* are preserved and sustained”

		
“धीयन्ते पुरुषार्था अनया इति धात्री”

“Lord *Vishṇu* gets supremely pleased if he is worshipped using *Dhātrī* and *Tulasī* on the day of *Ekādaśī*. One who wants to acquire wealth especially, should apply *Dhāthrī* on his body and bathe.”-declares the *Garuḍa purāṇa*.

> तुष्यत्यामलकैर्विष्णुरेकादश्यां विशेषतः।   
> श्रीकामः सर्वदा स्नानं कुर्वीतामलकैर्नरः॥ \(गरुडपुराण अध्याय 2215\) 

Question 10: The story of gooseberry narrated in the *purāṇas* is very interesting indeed. It is in the form of a praise. It states that gooseberry is a highly nourishing food rich with all vitamins, keeps *Tridoshas* under check, subdues *vāta* and pitta, increases the vital power and cures blood related difficiencies, tiredness, dropsy and ailments related to tension. All this can be accepted because medical science also endorses that, and can be actually experienced also. Isn’t the rest a mere flattery?

Ans: No, not at all. They are not just praises. Every word written there is true. Just as it cures a number of physical ailments, it is beneficial in the spheres of *ādhidaivika* and *Ādhyātmika* also.

If one receives it as *Prasāda* after offering it to the divine forms viz., *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*, those gods will be pleased by that. By consuming it and using it in taking a bath, centers which are helpful for the meditation of those deities blossom, and facilitate the accomplishment of the desires by *upāsana*. Consuming of gooseberry removes the *samskāras* related to deficiencies of virtues, intelligence riches and health. As it causes *dhātusāmya* in the dispositions, its consumption helps to secure *yoga samādhi* and *moksha*, as said earlier in the words “अन्ते निर्वाणमेव च”. Because of the imbalance of *Dhātus* alone, distraction and fickleness are caused in one’s nature. When a perfect coordination of them is achieved, *samādhi siddhi* and *daivasākshātkāra* become possible.

“धातुप्रसादान्महिमानमीशं ॥

This does not mean that all those who consume gooseberry attain *moksha*. The purport is, it will be helpful for the *Sādhakas* in the visualization of God, if it is consumed as recommended.

The fact that the imbalances created as a result of fasting on the previous day i.e. *Ekādaśī* would be set right by consuming gooseberry the next day \(i.e. *dvādaśī*\), is established by experience. It will be highly beneficial if it is consumed with the attitude of *Prasāda* after worship. That is why the custom of desisting from eating it before *Utthānadvādaśī* even if it is available in the trees, and as a rule, having it on *Utthānadvādaśī* only after the worship as a rule, is in vogue.

If we consider the details given above, it is clear that consumption of gooseberry has profitable effects in the *ādhibhautika*, *ādhidaivika* and *ādhyātmika* spheres and grants all four fold values of life.

		
Question 11: Let us consume gooseberry, If is fine. But why should we worship the gooseberry tree?

Ans: *Pūjā* is not offered to the gooseberry tree, but to the deity who resides thereby with the tree as a medium. It is for this very reason that nothing is mentioned about its leaves, bark, colour, taste or the like in its worship, but only described by names such as *Dhātri, Jagaddhātri,* Mother of the world, *Kamalā, Lakshmī* etc. This *devata* has a specific form, dress, ornaments and *mudrās*. She wears white clothes. She rides on a swan. Her hands sport a rosary and *jnānamudrās*. She has a book and a lotus in her hands. This is the description of the deity *Dhātrī* found in the *Āgamas*.

Question 12: Why should *Tulasī* also be worshiped along with *Dhātri*?

Ans: Both are indeed the representatives of *Jaganmātā*. They are equal in their qualities and *yogamahimā*. This has been explained earlier. If both of these are placed side by side and the image of the Lord is placed in between them and worshipped, exceptional benefit of the *purushārthās* is obtained.

Question 13: Why should the lamp in a gooseberry container be lighted on that day using cow’s ghee?

Ans: Gooseberry itself has extraordinary powers. Cow’s ghee also has the power of granting *purushārthās*. Cow’s ghee helps in the accomplishment of *jnāna* and *moksha*. \(Ginglley oil also causes wealth and fame and helps one to get over difficulties.\)

> गोघृतं ज्ञानसिद्ध्यर्थं मोक्षसिद्ध्यर्थमेव च।   
> सम्पदर्थं यशोऽर्थं च तैलं पीडानिवारकम् ॥ 

In this way a lamp lighted with the *yoga* of glorious gooseberry and cow’s ghee has holiness in it. Even the sight of it, meditation upon it and its smell-all of these redeem sins, ward off torments and facilitate the accomplishment of knowledge. Even the wind that passes around the *āmalakī* tree cures diseases. Thus, it is most appropriate to specially worship the gooseberry tree on *Utthānadvādaśī*, which removes difficulties and brings about happiness.





	 
## Varamahālakshmīvrata

*Varamahālakshmīvrata* is considered as one of the most famous *vratas* observed in the month of *śrāvaṇa*. In case the month of *śrāvaṇa* occurs twice in the form of *nija* and *adhika* \(regular and intercalary\), this *Vrata* is observed only in the *nija śrāvaṇa*. Even though it is not enjoined among the regular *vratas* like *Ekādaśī, Śivarātri* etc which should be observed by all, this *vrata* is observed to please Goddess *Jaganmātā* with great devotion and religious fervour by a large number of devotees in our country.

There is a *vidhi* which stipulates that this *vrata* should be observed on a *Friday* which is nearest to the *Pūrṇimā* of the month of *śrāvaṇa.*

> शुक्ले श्रावणिके मासे पूर्णिमोपान्त्यभार्गवे ।   
> वरलक्ष्म्या व्रतं कार्यं सर्वसिद्धिप्रदायकम् ॥ 

> नभोमासे पूर्णिमायां अन्तिकस्थे भृगोर्दिने ।   
> मत्पूजा तत्र कर्तव्या सर्वसिद्धिप्रदायिनी ॥ व्रतरत्न page 110-116 

*Śāstras* command that, *Varamahālakshmī* should be worshipped on the day of *śrāvaṇa Śukla Pūrṇima* when the planet *śukra* is shining in the eastern sky.

There is also an opinion that this *Vrata* should be celebrated on the second Friday of *śrāvaṇa Śuklapaksha*. But, the practice of celebrating this *Vrata* on other Fridays of *śrāvaṇa Śuklapaksha* is also there.

The deity worshipped in this *Vrata* is *Varamahālakshmī*. As she grants boons, and as she is also a superior goddess, she is called *Varamahālakshmī*. \(वरदा महालक्ष्मीः, वरा च लक्ष्मीश्च\). We find this name recited in *‘Devī ashṭottaranāmastotra’* as “वरलक्ष्मीं वसुप्रदाम्.”

She is the mother of all living creatures and she blesses everyone with everything auspicious and the best, and therefore is referred to as *‘lokamāta’* \(mother of the universe\) and *‘maṅgaladevatā’* \(auspicious goddess\) etc. The words *‘śrīh’* and *‘Lakshmīh’* stand for all the best things which are being desired for by all. Therefore she is revered by one and all. Wisdom says that she is worthy of worship by all. Thoughtless persons indulge in deriding and insulting her and her holy names, taking them only in a narrow sense. This is made clear by one or two examples. A leader once proclaimed in a public gathering thus:—

“I had been to *Badarikāśrama* a few days ago. I had the *darśan* of only Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. I did not have the *darśan* of *Lakshmīdevī* at all because I do not crave for *Lakshmī* or wealth. What I want is the well being and prosperity of people”.

Once, *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* blessed the house of a devotee by naming it *‘Lakshmīvilāsam’*. A person who fancied himself to be a scholar, happened to look at the name board in front of the house of the devotee, and ridiculed with a remark—“The people who live in this house are only after money. They do not have love of knowledge. They are not interested in social service. That is why names like *‘vidyāvilāsam’* or *‘sevāsadanam’* did not occur to them. Their only aim is to make money and it is clearly suggested by the name given to the house.”

Even in ancient times some people have used derogatory words referring to HER without discerning the divine and the grand sense pervading the word *‘Lakshmī’*. Poet *Bāṇa* in the chapter *‘sukanāsopadesa’* of *kādambari* says “When this *Lakshmī* was born in the ocean of milk she obtained passion \(red color and lust\) from the tender leaves of *pārijāta* and crookedness from the digit of the moon \(darker half of moon\), fickleness from *uccaiśśravas* \(the divine horse\), seductive power from *kālakūṭa* poison, haughtiness from *madirā* \(intoxicating liquor\) and extreme harshness from the *kaustubha* \(divine gem.\). She has acquired all these because of her association with them. There is no other *anāryā* \(dishonourable person\) like her”. \(इयं लक्ष्मीःक्षीरसागरात् पारिजातपल्लवेभ्यो रागम्, इन्दुशकलादेकान्तवक्रताम्, उच्चैश्श्रवसः चञ्चलतां, कालकूटान्मोहनशक्तिं, मदिरायाः मदं, कौस्तुभमणेः अतिनैष्ठुर्यं, इत्येतानि सहवासपरिचयात् गृहीत्वैव उद्गता. . . अनार्या \(कादम्बरी-शुकनासोपदेश\)

The poet intends to state that money makes one haughty, it causes jealousy, love and hatred, crookedness of mind, seductiveness, haughtiness, and harshness. Though he wishes to drive home this point, it is foolishness on his part to decry the great Goddess, as that very Goddess *VidyāLakshmī* is the cause of all his prosperity and poetic talent.

Some people proclaim “I do not desire money. I need the help of people, I wish the wellness of the world, I desire for success in my endeavors and *mukti*.”

All the things they desire viz., wealth of human resources, wealth of character, wealth of success in their endeavors, wealth of development of the world and *moksha* are all true forms of Lakshmi and are only a small part of the great glories of the great Goddess *MahāLakshmī*, and unfortunately it is not noted by them.

The *āgama śāstras* say that *DhanaLakshmī* \(wealth\), *DhānyaLakshmī* \(cereals\), *SantānaLakshmī* \(progeny\), *VidyāLakshmī* \(knowledge\), *ShauryaLakshmī* \(valour\), *KīrtiLakshmī* \(fame\), *SaumyaLakshmī* \(gentle character-benign\) and *VijayaLakshmī* \(victory\) are all forms of goddesses *AshṭaLakshmī* \(*Lakshmī* of eight forms\) Also, the idols of these eight forms have been consecrated and established in a number of temples. We come across the words *SiddhaLakshmīh* and *MokshaLakshmīh* in vedic hymns. So, to talk disrespectfully of the *Jaganmāta* who grants all the desirable *Purushārthas* of people, is nothing but ignorance.

“Money brings along with it, arrogance, envy, jealousy, hatred and a host of other misfortunes. This wealth is also a form of *Lakshmī*. Therefore we condemn her,” say some people. This is not correct. Because knowledge, age \(youth\), success, physical strength, support of people etc., cause arrogance in many people. For this reason all these do not deserve to be rejected. It is good judgment to accomplish the benefit of oneself and of the world from these. These are all glories of God and should be revered. This rule applies to money as well. It is also a *vibhūti* \(a glory\) of the mother of the universe. One should use it for the attainment of *Dharma* and for rightful material enjoyment. “धनाद्धर्मं ततस्सुखं”. **Here we remember great words of *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* who said “If wealth can be useful in any way to attain the supreme truth, I will not turn away from that \(wealth\)”.**

This opinion is also endorsed by the following *Subhashita*—

> वक्त्राब्जे भाग्यलक्ष्मीः करतलकमले सर्वदा धान्यलक्ष्मीः   
> दोर्दण्डे वीरलक्ष्मीः हृदयसरसिजे भूतकारुण्यलक्ष्मीः ।   
> खड्गाग्रे शौर्यलक्ष्मीः निखिलगुणगणाडम्बरे कीर्तिलक्ष्मीः   
> सर्वाङ्गे सौम्यलक्ष्मीः सपदि भवतु मे धर्ममोक्षार्थसिद्धेः ॥ 

\(Let *BhāgyaLakshmī* be on my lotus \(shaped\) face, *DhānyaLakshmī* \(cereals\) in my lotus shaped hands. *VīraLakshmī* \(valour\) in my shoulders, *BhūtadayāLakshmī* \(compassion for all living creatures\) in my lotus heart, *ŚauryaLakshmī* \(heroism\) at the tip of my sword and *KīrtiLakshmī* \(fame\) when I grandly exhibit the multitude of noble characters \(qualities\) and *SaumyaLakshmī* \(handsomeness or beauty\) be present immediately in all the parts of my body. And let all these *Lakshmīs* settle in those parts at all the times for the attainment of *dharma* and *moksha*.\) Even an *ātmasādhaka* and a *sanyāsī*, who have given up the desire for women, wealth fame or profit, aspire for the wealth of *ātmaguṇas* such as *Bhūtadayā* \(universal benevolence\) *kshamā* \(forgiveness\), *anasūyā* \(absence of jealousy\) and the wealth of *moksha*. As all these are forms of *Lakshmī*, She is worshipful to them also, as she grants them all.

That is why it is said in the *Śrutis, smṛtis, purāṇas, Āgamas* and *Itihāsas*, that even *Brahma* and other gods, all *purushārtha* seekers and *siddhas* have worshipped *MahāLakshmī*. The three great *Acāryas* viz. *Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja* and *Ānandatīrtha* and other *mahātmas* have sung the sweet devotional *stotras* of Goddess *Laksmī*.

We can note that the word *Lakshmīh* means one who is always watching \(observing\) everything. “लक्षयति सर्वं सदा इति लक्ष्मीः”. The word also indicates that she, the mother of the universe herself, is the consort of Lord *Nārāyaṇa* who is an eternal witness to all, and, in eternal union with him she stands as an all-knowing \(Goddess\) and a witness to all. **We respectfully recall here the explanation given by *Śrīraṅgamahāguru* who said “She bears the symbols \(*lakshma*\) of the Lord. She is *parabrahmamayī* \(filled with the supreme spirit\) and *parabrahmagṛhiṇī* \(divine consort of the supreme spirit\)”.**

The famous epitbet \(word\) *‘Śrīh’* also clearly proclaims her excellence She tears apart all evils and makes the whole world happy by her noble qualities. She dwells in the supreme spirit; she is the refuge to all the living beings. She listens to her praise sung by the devotees.

शृणाति निखिलान् दोषान् श्रिणाति च गुणैर्जगत् ।   
श्रियते चाखिलैर्नित्यं श्रयते च परं पदम् ।   
> श्रयन्तीं श्रयमाणां च शृण्वतीं शृणतीमपि ॥ 

The words which denote her such as *‘ramā’ ‘mā’ ‘Maṅgaladevatā’, ‘Kshīrasāgarakanyaka’, ‘Indirā’* etc., proclaim this supreme greatness \(glory\) of her.

*“Purushottama* \(Lord *Vishṇu*\) is your divine consort, the Lord of the serpents who is the form of the prāṇic force, is your couch and seat, *Garuḍa* the *vedātma* \(the soul of vedas\) and the king of birds, is your vehicle, The *māyā* \(the deluding power\) which enchants the world is a veil of your sport, *Brahma* and the other *devas* with their consorts are your slaves; your very name *‘Śrī’* is the best among names . Who is equal to you? Who is greater than you? How is it possible to praise you?” All the divine forces such as *Gāyatrī, Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī* are nothing but your various forms or glories.

Great sayings of *Ācāryas* such as—“You are famous by names viz *gīrdevata, garuḍadhvaja’s* wife, *Śākambharī, Śaśiśekhara’s* consort; you sport in the acts of creation, sustenance and destruction. You are parāśakti \(supreme power\), and *parāprakṛti* \(supreme nature\). Everything symbolized by feminity in this world is your own form. Who is equal to you?,” proclaim that she is the cause of everything, is supreme, works together with the supreme entity, imperishable, the embodiment of all forces, and proficient in protecting all. *Varamahālaksmī vrata* is thus a great festival of worshipping such a great Goddess.

Devotees adore her as a supreme goddess, divine consort of *Nārāyaṇa* the *Paramapurusha, Akhilajaganmāta* \(holy mother of all the words\). *Anādisiddha* \(accomplished without a beginning\), *Ānandamayī* \(filled with divine bliss\), *Anantakalyāṇaguṇaparipūrṇā* \(who is perfect with and complete with infinite noble, benedictive qualities\), the form of all power \(*sarvaśaktisvarūpiṇi*\), one who grants all the rightful desires of beings and the divine proprietress of everything \(*sarveśvari*\).

> नमस्ते चिदचिद्वर्गसंरक्षणविचक्षणे ।   
> जगद्विधानशिल्पिन्यै विष्णुपत्न्यै नमोऽस्तु ते ॥ 

Also, devotees praise her and salute her thus—“Salutations to you, the one who is capable and proficient in protecting both the classes of *cit* \(*jīva*-living beings\) and *acit* \(*jaḍa*-non-living things\), the sustaining architect \(*shilpiṇī*\) of the universe, and the divine consort of Lord *Nārāyaṇa”*. And in the scriptures which describe her greatness as *nityasiddha* \(eternally accomplished\), *nityaśuddha* \(eternally pure\), *nityabuddha* \(eternally wise\), *nityamukta* \(eternally free\), and *maṅgaladevatā* \(goddess of auspiciousness\), and we see that she is depicted as the one who was born in the ocean of milk, the sister of the king of seven seas, the sister of the moon, the one who took birth in the sacred fire \[sacrificial pit \(*yajnakunḍa*\)\], and manifested in a lotus. etc. We see many such depictions in our *śāstras* and *purāṇas*. When rationalists come across such descriptions, naturally they raise a number of questions.

They may ask: “If *ŚrīLakshmī* is an eternally established principle where is the question of her being born? All those who take birth must die. We worship goddesses to escape from the states \(changes\) such as birth, growth and death. How can that very Goddess have such transformations?

“If she is the younger sister of the moon, he must be senior to her and if it is so, can’t we worship him instead, who stays in the position of her *guru* as the supreme principle? Also, there is no unanimity regarding the theory of her birth. To say at one time that she is born in the ocean, and at another time to describe that she is born in the fire of sacrificial *yajna* and yet again to state that she is born in a lotus, only go to state that all these are stories fabricated at different times, or only poetic fancies. On the other hand, if all these statements are true, she will be just like any other ordinary mortal, taking many births at different times.”

The incident of *devas* and *asuras* churning the ocean of milk for obtaining *amṛta* and this *maṅgalamūrtī* \(auspicious form\) *Lakshmī* manifesting from the ocean, wedding Lord *Nārāyaṇa* and residing in his bosom, is renowned in the stories of the churning of the ocean quoted by the *purāṇas*. If this is true, the question that would arise is whether she was not the consort of Lord *Nārāyaṇa* before this incident. And thus many may think that all these statements could be fragments of imagination. There is no end to such speculations and arguments. So, the real meaning has to be gathered only from the enlightened people who possess divine knowledge and yogic experience. One can arrive at the conclusion only from the knowledge obtained by the blessings of the supreme Goddess. ***Śrīraṅgamahāguru* gave the \(satisfactory\) explanation which leaves no scope for delusion, doubt or deceit in this regard. We quote here the explanation bestowed by him.**

		
“The *samudramathana* \(churning of the ocean\) described in our *purāṇas* and *Itihāsas* is a beautiful and a divine metaphor. It is a didactic poetry that teaches the true meanings in an effective, faultless dignified, simple and a beautiful way. The pondering of the sādhakas to obtain the divine nectar of supreme bliss \(*paramanandamṛta*\) by meditation is nothing but the churning of the ocean \(*Dhyāna mathana*\). “अन्तस्समुद्रे कवयो वयन्ति” *“manakkaḍalil vāḷavalla māyamanāḷa nambī”*. The *āranyokopanishat* refers to this as an upward churning \(*ūrdvamukhamathana*\). For such a churning, both the *daiva* and *āsura* forces should cooperate. “The backbone which is called *‘merudanḍa’* in the *Yogaśāstras* is the churning staff. The *kunḍalinī* or the pranic power \(force\) is the serpent śesha that cooperates as a churning rope for this marvellous churning of the ocean. While churning thus, the poison, which is great delusion and misery personified, is nothing but a great obstacle to *Yoga*, appears first. Valiant *mahādeva* swallows this this great obstacle in the form of great delusion and agony playfully and blesses the devotees. Next, the great obstacle of instability that is encountered by the *sādhakas* is removed by Lord *Nārāyaṇa* in the tortoise form, who \(the tortoise\) has subdued passions, and brings everything under control. This churning of \(meditation\) continues by the grace and power of God. Then, in the internal world \(of *sādhakas*\) many siddhis \(alluring occult powers\) show up. The divine cow *‘Kāmadhenu’*, the divine tree *‘kalpavṛksha’*, the divine elephant *‘airāvata’*, and the divine damsels of the heavens etc., are those *siddhis*. In this series, *Candra devatā* \(The Moon\) who is the form of the mind principle, appears. Afterwards *Varamahālakshmī* the mother of the universe, the supreme bliss and the supreme divine knowledge personified, appears. These are true yogic visions. Not imaginations. These are not the events of the physical world that occurred somewhere or during some period in the past. These are true yogic experiences \(visions\) that can be obtained by all the sādhakas during genuine *sādhana*, under the guidance of *Brahmajnānis*. They can be obtained even now and also in the future. Such yogis, by Her grace can also have the auspicious experience of *MahāLakshmī* merging in the heart of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*. Because she appears in the *‘yoga bhūmi’* \(inner world\) after the appearance of candra *devatā*, she is called the younger sister of *candra*. Here there is no question \(*Candra* or *Lakshmī* being\) elder or younger at all.

As *ŚrīLakshmī* is seen \(visualized\) in the inner ocean of consciousness, and in the inner world of yogis, it is stated metaphorically that she was born as the daughter of the king of oceans. She has no physical changes such as birth, growth etc. As she is visualized as a result of spiritual *yajna*, it is said that she was born in the *yajnakunḍa*. As she appears in all the lotuses such as *mūlādhāra* she is called as *‘Padmasambhava’* \(born of lotus\).

*Lakshmī*, the eternal auspiciousness incarnate, is also called the *svayamvarapatnī* of *Nārāyaṇa* \(i.e. the one who married *Nārāyaṇa* out of her pure will\) by the *jnāni’s*, because, after bestowing *darśana* to the *sādhakas* first, she again bestows *darśana* from the lotus seat of *Nārāyaṇa’s* heart.

> आविर्भावः कलशजलधावध्वरे वापि यस्याः   
> स्थानं यस्याः सरसिजवनं विष्णुवक्षःस्थलं वा ।   
> भूमा यस्या भुवनमखिलं देवि दिव्यं पदं वा   
> स्तोकप्रज्ञैरनवधिगुणा स्तूयसे सा कथं त्वं ॥ \(श्रीवेदान्तदेशिकः- श्रीस्तुतिः\) 

\(O goddess, you were born in the ocean of divine nectar. You \(manifested\) in the sacrificial fire of *yajna* too. Your residence is the lotus-lake. And also the bosom of lord *Nārāyaṇa*. Your extent is the whole universe and also the divine world. How can you, the one with limitless virtues, be praised by people of small intellect?\)

The names *Padmā* and *kamalā* suit her very well. She appears in the lotuses of the inner heart. She holds lotuses in her hands. She resembles the lotus very much in her feet, the hands, the face and other parts of her divine auspicious body, and also in the divine fragrance of the body. She is *Padmāvatī* who is lotus all over.

> पद्मप्रियां पद्महस्तां पद्माक्षीं पद्मसम्भवाम् ।   
> पद्मनाभप्रियां देवीं पद्मिनीं पद्मगन्धिनीम् ॥ 

> पद्मप्रिये पद्मिनि पद्महस्ते पद्मालये पद्मदलायताक्षि।   
> विश्वप्रिये विष्णुमनोऽनुकूले त्वत्पादपद्मं मयि सन्निधत्स्व ॥   
> वाग्भूगौर्यादिभेदैर्विदुरिह मुनयो यां यदीयैश्च पुंसाम् ॥   
\(श्रीशङ्गरः, विष्णुपादादिकेशान्तस्तुति\) 

She is *Gāyatrī, Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī*, and *Durgī. Śraddhā, Medhā, Kīrti* and many such other powers are her glories. Everything in the world that is feminine is hers and all that is masculine is of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*, the ultimate *purusha*. She is the true form of the supreme light \(*Parañjyotisvarūpa*\) without any gender discrimination.

> देवे यन्मानुषेषु पुंनामा भगवान् हरिः ।   
> स्त्रीनाम्नी श्रीश्च विज्ञेया नानयोर्विद्यते परम् ॥ \(विष्णुपारण 1-8\) 

She co-operates with *ŚrīmanNārāyaṇa* in the sport of the cosmos, displaying her *avatāra līlas* \(sports of incarnation\). She is adorned by other names viz *Bhārgavi* \(born in the *Bhṛgu* family\) *Jānakī* \(daughter of king *Janaka*\), *Vaidarbhī* \(daughter of king of *vidarbha* and also known as *Rukmiṇī*.

> राघवत्वेऽभवत्सीता रुकिणी कृष्णजन्मनि ।   
> अन्येषु चावतारेषु विष्णोरेषानपायिनी ॥ \(विष्णुपुराण 1-9\) 

यद्भावेषु पृथग्विधेष्वनुगुणान् भावान् स्वयं बिभ्रती   
> यद्धर्मैरिह धर्मिणी विहरते नानाकृतिर्नायिका ॥   
\(वेदान्तदेशिकः-दशावतारस्तोत्र 1\) 

\(This *Jagannāyikā* \(leader of the universe\) *MahāLakshmī* sports in different *bhāvas*, playing the role of *Sahadharmiṇī* \(lawful wife\) of the Lord by shouldering his *dharmas* and assuming various modes during the manifold dispositions of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*.\)

It is stated figuratively only that God descends \(takes incarnations\), when he manifests himself for the good of the world, even though he is a *nityasvarūpa* \(of eternal true form\) and does not undergo changes such as birth or growth.

उत्पन्नः प्रोच्यते विद्वन् नित्य एवोपचारतः \(विष्णुपुराण 1-3-4\)

This principle applies to Goddess *MahāLakshmī* as well.

Our salutations in great reverence to the *yogapurusha* and his consort *yoga Lakshmī*, who unravelled the knot of our doubts by explaining the true meaning \(of *MahāLakshmī*\)

### *Utsava* and *pūjāvidhi* :

So far we discussed in detail the divine form of *Varamahālakshmī*. Now we shall discuss the modalities of observing this festival.

Some staunch devotees observe fast till the evening on the day of the festival and worship *Jaganmāta Lakshmī*, invoking her in *Kalaśas*, and some other devotees, without those observances simply worship her and observe the festival. As we have already noted, this *vrata* is suitably observed on a *Friday* which is nearest to the full moon day of *śrāvaṇa*.

> शुक्ले श्रावणिके मासे पूर्णिमोपान्त्यभार्गवे ।  
> वरलक्ष्या व्रतं कार्यं सर्वमाङ्गल्यसिद्धये ॥ 

In case the month of *śrāvaṇa* happens to be an *adhikamāsa* the festival should not be celebrated. The *Vrata* should be celebrated in the regular *śrāvaṇa* only.

### *PūjāVidhi* \(Precepts of worship\)

Those who have fealty to the *vrata* should invoke the *Devi* in a holy *kalaśa* or in an idol with proper *saṅkalpa* and worship her. According to the procedures set by *bhavishyottara purāṇa*, devotees along with their family members should do *saṅkalpa* praying for long life, good health, progeny, wealth, safety, steadfastness, success, and all other auspicious things, and offer *shoḍaśopacāras* like *Dhyāna* etc. to *Śrīmāta*. In this *Mahāpūja* after the *Kalaśa pūja* and *pīṭha pūja*, a *tantupuñja* \(heap of threads\) made of brand new golden coloured threads numbering twelve and having twelve knots should be installed and the goddess is to be invoked in the heap and worshipped. Goddess can also be invoked in the idol of *Śrīdevi*, and/or in a *pūrṇakumbha*, bedecked with sandal paste, flowers and tender leaves, or in a pot which is filled with unbroken rice or wheat grains. There is also a custom of invoking the Goddess in one or two of the above three arrangements. Then the *aṅgapūja* \(worship to the parts of the idol\), *pushpa pūjā* \(worship with flowers\), and the worship with leaves should be offered to her with the recitation of the names of *Ramā, MahāLakshmī* etc. ending with *Namah*, or, *ashṭottara pūja* should offered with the recitation of the names *Prakriti* etc. ending in *Namah* And *pūja* should be offered to the Goddess invoked in the *tantupuñja* with the twelve recitations beginning with name *Ramā* and ending in the salutary word *Namah*. Devotees who can afford, may prepare a sweet dish called *Sajjappa* and offer it to the Goddess as a special *naivedya*.

In this *Vrata*, the *tantupūja* forms a very important part. *Jaganmāta* who herself is present in the form of the holy thread, accepts the worship. At the end of the *pūja*, after praying her with earnest devotion to grant all the desires, and after obtaining her permission, the thread should be saluted and tied to the right wrist. And again with her permission, the old thread should be discarded. The prayer hymn pertaining to these are—

> दारिद्र्यसागरे मग्ना भीताहं भवभीतितः।   
> दोरं गृणामि कमले ममाभीष्टप्रदा भव ॥ 

\(I am drowned in the ocean of poverty. The ocean of life is frightening me. O *Kamalādevi* \! I am taking this worshipped thread. Kindly grant me my desires\)

> कमले दोररूपेण स्थिते सर्वाघहारिणि ।   
> नमस्त्रैलोक्यजननि दारिद्र्य मे निवारय ॥ 

\(*Kamalādevi* \!, you are present in this *dora* \(sacred thread\)\! You are the destroyer of all sins\! O *trilokajanani* \! \(mother of the three worlds\)\! I salute you. Remove my poverty\)

> द्वादशग्रन्थिसंयुक्तं कृतं द्वादशतन्तुभिः ।   
> धारयामि महादेवि सूत्रं ते सर्वमङ्गले ॥ 

\(O *Sarvamaṅgaladevatā*, I now wear your dora which is made of twelve knots and twelve threads\)

> दामोदरि नमस्तेस्तु नमस्ते लोकनायकि ।   
> नमस्तेऽस्तु महालक्ष्मि त्राहि मां परमेश्वरि ॥ 

\(O consort of Lord *Dāmodara* \! I salute you. O Proprietress of the world\!, I salute you. O *MahāLakshmī\! Parameśvarī*, I bow to you. Protect me\).

The number of flour cakes to be offered to *devī* are twelve. After offering the worship with flowers in cupped hands united to the goddess, twelve cakes should be offered to a devout Brahmin who is well versed in the *vedas* and who has *bhakti* in *Śrīdevi*. “It is the mother of the universe herself who receives this gift \(*dāna*\), and again it is only SHE who gifts them \(to others\). She alone makes \(helps\) both \(the giver and the receiver\) to cross \(the ocean of life\)”—With this devotion, this auspicious ritual should be accomplished with deep absorption in the worship.

> इन्दिरा प्रतिगृहणातु इन्दिरा वै ददाति च ।   
> इन्दिरा तारिकोभाभ्यां इन्दिरायै नमो नमः ॥ 

Among the vedic hymns chanted in this *pūja*, *Śrīsūkta* is the most important vedic hymn. The hymns of this *sūkta* are chanted in all of the important *upacāras*. A special *pūja* for the Goddess is offered in the evening.

#### Analysis
An analysis of the *pūjāvidhi* \(precepts of worship\)

When we look at the modalities of the *Varamahālakshmī pūja*, we find that some of the aspects of the *pūja* need explanation.

		
Why should *Varamahālakshmī* vrata be celebrated only on the Friday which is nearest to *śrāvaṇa Pūrṇima*? This is the first question. The great sages have stipulated certain specific days for various festivals, which are conducive both externally and internally to the natural opening up of special spiritual centers related to the deity being worshipped, and when the grace of that deity specially flows in the *sādhaka*. This is the common principle which should be remembered here also.

It is famous both in scriptures and tradition that the month of *śrāvaṇa* and Saturday are very auspicious for the worship of *Mahāvishṇu*, and the month of *Kārtika* and Mondays are auspicious days for the worship of Lord *Śiva*. And thus it is natural \(and also appropriate\) to worship *Jaganmāta Śrīdevi*, the consort of Lord *Nārāyaṇa*, specially in the month of *śrāvaṇa* itself, as this month is dear to him.

> नमस्ते चिदचिद्वर्गसंरक्षणविचक्षणे ।   
> जगद्विधानशिल्पिन्यै विष्णुपत्नयै नमोऽस्तु ते ॥   
> विश्वप्रिये विष्णुमनोनूकूले त्वत्पादपद्मं मयि सन्निधत्स्व 

Of the two fortnights, the *Śukla* paksha is dear to *devas*. The dark half is dear to the manes. And it is very appropriate to worship *Śrīramādevī* who is *devadevī* \(goddess of gods\) and *maṅgaladevatā*, in the *Śuklapaksha* itself.

Why should the special pooja be done on Friday only? We have to remember the *tattva* that *Bhārgava \(sukra\) nadi* is related to *Śrīgranthi* which is between the eyebrows. *MahāLakshmī*, along with *Dhātā* and *Vidhātā*, incarnated as the daughter of the couple viz. sage *Bhṛgu* and his wife *Khyāti*. She takes the incarnation as the eternal divine consort of the immutable Lord *Nārāyaṇa* who pervades everything. She does so for the welfare of her devotees, both in the internal and the external spheres. One of her many incarnations is the incarnation of *‘Bhārgavī’*. For this reason also *Bhārgavavāsara* \(Friday\) is dear to her. This sacred legend may be reflected upon here.

> देवौ धातृविधातारौ भृगोः ख्यातिरसूयत ।   
> श्रियं च देवदेवस्य पत्नी नारायणस्य या ।   
> नित्यैवैषा जगन्माता विष्णोः श्रीरनपायिनी ।   
> यथा सर्वगतो विष्णुः तथैवेयं द्विजोत्तम ॥ \(विष्णुपुराण 1-8-15\) 

Not only the Fridays in the month of *śrāvaṇa* but Fridays of all the months are dear to *Śrīdevī*. The conjunction time of the day and the evening \(i.e. the evening twilight\) is naturally auspicious for the union of *prāṇa* and *apāna*, and more so for meditating upon her. *Sandhyā, Sāvitrī, Gāyatrī, Sarasvatī*—all these are indeed her own forms. *Pūrṇima* is the day when the moon appears gloriously with all the digits, and the Friday that is near to it is still more an auspicious time for her *Pūja*. That is the time when *Lakshmī* enters our houses. The doors of the houses should be kept open at that time. Houses should be decorated with the imprints of *Lakshmī’s* lotus feet.

Why should she be worshipped in a twelve threaded *dora* only?

This matter is also in accordance to her *Vaishṇavībhāva*. Twelve is a powerful mystic number dear to Lord *Vāsudeva*. He is the reigning deity of the twelve months who inspires the twelve suns with twelve divine names *Keśava* etc.

> एवं सर्वत्र निच्छिद्रं नामद्वादशपञ्जरम् ।   
> प्रविष्टोऽहं न मे किञ्जिद्भयमस्ति कदाचन ॥ 

— Says the *Nāmadvādaśapañjarikāstuti* in his praise.

His devotees put on *Dvādasordhvapunḍras*. The *‘Vāsudevamahāmantra’* furnished with twelve letters is one of the extensive great *mantras* prefixed with *praṇava*. Thus it is natural that *ŚrīVaramahālakshmī* who is *Dvādaśātmikā* and who is the *Parāśakti* of the Lord who is *Dvādaśātmaka* and who is in eternal union with *ŚrīmanNārāyaṇa,* receives *Dvādasanāmāvalipūjā* in twelve *tantu granthis*. As she is golden coloured, the rule that she should be invoked in a golden coloured twelve threaded *dora* is also equally natural.

हिरण्यवर्णां हरिणीं सुवर्णरजतस्रजाम् ।

Now about the special *naivedya* which is offered to her.

*Sajjeyappa* \(a sweet dish made of wheat, sugar and ghee\) and *modaka* \(another sweet dish\) are both endowed with distinct sweetness and complement the *Sātvikabhāva* \(virtuous nature\) in people. “सात्त्विका मधुरप्रियाः”. Goddess *Varamahālakshmī* is also *“śuddhasattvamayī”* \(full of pure noble nature\). These eatables are filled with a rasa which is specially supportive of *ātmasukha*.” When we receive these as *prasāda* of *Śrīdevi*, their potential to induce the pleasure of material enjoyment and bliss of emancipation \(*bhogamokshaprada*\) increases. “मुमुक्षोर्माधुर्यम्” We have to remember here that they also support the blooming of the *Śrīgranthi*.

Why should she be invoked in a holy water filled *kumbha*? Why should one invoke her in a *kumbha* filled with *akhanḍa* \(unbroken\) *tanḍula* \(rice grain\) and *Godhūma* \(wheat\)?

The part of our body from the neck to the top of the head is called *‘kumbha.’* “कण्ठादुपरिमूर्धान्त”. This part of the divine bodies of *Jnānis* in which the spiritual forces flow upwards is a divine pot itself, \(*ūrdhvakumbha*\). It is full of pleasant spiritual energy. So, the invoking of *Mahāyogeśvari*, the holy mother in the upright *pūrṇakumbha*, filled with holy water representative of the above, is naturally in accordance with the practice of *Yoga*. The pot filled with unbroken pure grain, stands for the principle that she is *DhānyaLakshmī*. And she is indeed the form of *paramānnahavishya* \(pure sacrificial cooked rice\) fit to be served for the enjoyment of the *devas*. These two *kumbhas* are symbolic of the vow “क्षुत्पिपासामलां ज्येष्ठामलक्ष्मीर्नाशयाम्यहम्”. \(I shall destroy the *aLakshmī* \(evil fortune, bad luck\) called *‘jyeshṭhā’* associated with the impurity of hunger and thirst.\) The tender leaves of banyan, mango, and other sacrificial trees used here to decorate the holy pots, stand for the ever fresh brilliance, the double prosperity of the material world and spiritual welfare \(*abhyudaya* and *niśśreyas*\). Their very sight is also auspicious.

The *Śrīsūkta* which is chanted during her *pūja* is indeed a divine hymn which conveys the wealth of her all pervading total auspiciousness \(*sarvamāṅgalyadevībhāva*\). Just as the *Purushasūkta* is chanted in the worship of *ŚrīmanNārāyaṇa* with every service \(like *Dhūpa, Dīpa, arcana* etc.\), it is quite appropriate that *Śrīsūkta* is chanted during the worship of *MahāLakshmī* with every service. All the *purusharūpas* \(male forms\) belong to that *Paramapurusha* and all the *strīrūpas* \(female forms\) belong to the *parabrahmagṛhiṇi*

> देवतिर्यङ्मनुष्येषु पुन्नामा भगवान्हरिः ।   
> स्त्रीनाम्नी श्रीश्च विज्ञेया नानयोर्विद्यते परम् ॥ \(विष्णुपुराण 1-8-35\)
