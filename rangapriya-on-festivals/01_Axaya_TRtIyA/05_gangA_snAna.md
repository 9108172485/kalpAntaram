**d\) *Gaṅgā Snāna***

***Vidhi Vijnāna*\(Modalities\):** While discussing the rules of celebrating *Akshayatṛtīyā*, we have stated that a dip in the holy *Gaṅgā* is most auspicious. According to *Vagbhata*, even the \(regular\) bath taken in clean water on any day, is \(highly\) beneficial.

> दीपनं वृष्यमायुष्यं स्नानमूर्जाबलप्रदम् ।  
> कण्डूमलश्रमस्वेदतन्द्रातृड्दाहपाप्मजित्\(वाग्भट 2:15\) 

A bath stimulates *agni* in the stomach, increases the virility in the body, promotes long life and gives enthusiasm and strength. It removes itching, dirt, exhaustion, sweat, lethargic sleep, thirst, burning sensation, and sins. During *parvakālas*, water \(used for bathing\) possesses special powers to induce *puṇya*. Water used by *jnānis* and blessed by their grace is termed as *Tīrtha*. \(“ऋषिजुष्टजले गुरौ”-अमर\) \(यदध्यासितमर्हद्भिः तद्धि तीर्थं प्रचक्षते”-कुमारसम्भव सर्ग-6\) Taking a holy bath in that water cures not only bodily ailments but also mental illnesses.

		
Taking bath in clean water removes bodily dirt, sloth and fatigue and this is commonly experienced by all. But ordinary knowledge does not help in understanding how it can remove sins and bestow *puṇya*. Unless this is understood scientifically, the importance of having *Gaṅgāsnāna* on *akshyatṛtīyā* as prescribed by the *śāstras* cannot be known. Therefore we are taking this up for discussion. As a backdrop to this, we would like to give the commentary \(as commanded\) by Śrī Raṅgamahāguru pertaining to this.

### Puṇya and Pāpa
A background for the introduction to Puṇya and Pāpa.

“What do puṇya and pāpa mean? Generally no one ponders about that. The words—*‘Puṇya* is accrued”, “*Pāpa* has perished”—uttered by people casually, sometime sound as though they have better knowledge than those who have understood them clearly. But, are they visible to the naked eyes like the coming and going of, say a cow or a calf? Then what are they? A solid? Liquid? Gas? What is their form? Where are they located? How long do they exist? They are not meant for animals right? If they are applicable only to human beings, where do they remain and how long? Don’t they get reduced to ashes along with the person who has earned them, after he dies? Such questions naturally arise. They can be comprehended only when they are seen through the discriminating eyes of jnānis. Merit and sin are a kind of distinctive marks \(impressions\) recorded on the gramophone plate of the mind. They are also called *Samskāras* and *Vāsanās*. The impressions causing happiness are called *Puṇya* and the ones that cause misery are called *Pāpa*. Both these are marks imprinted on the mind. It is almost impossible to erase these inner impressions. They do not perish even when the soul leaves the body. As evident from the words “मनष्षष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति”, the mind also goes with him. All the old records of impressions will be present in the mind. They stay with the person as long as the relationship between the *jīva* and the mind exists. These marks do not touch the person who crosses the wheel of mind itself and flies to the place of Brahman. In all other persons, the impressions of *puṇya* bring happiness and the impressions of pāpa bring misery, and this phenomenon exists for ever. Deeds performed to imprint the marks of merit lead to happiness, and the ones contrary to that, lead to misery.”

By minding this principle as explained below, one can easily understand how a holy bath can absolve sins and cause *puṇya*.

1. A religious bath taken in the holy waters wash out all the dirt and inertia of the body. Tranquility is felt in the mind. Turbidity caused by the sinful impressions get removed. Mind becomes clear. Some marks of misery get erased and comfort sets in. Such comfort-causing marks are indeed *puṇya*. The crooked marks which get erased are *pāpa*. This should be understood clearly. 
2. Some *tīrthas* have the capacity to cure both bodily and mental ailments, as they \(the *tīrthas*\) come into contact with medicinal herbs and holy ground surfaces \(while they flow\). One who takes a bath in them is benefitted with the cure of bodily and mental ailments. 
3. Even by pondering about the meaning of names given to the holy waters by the *maharshis* such as *‘Pāpanaśini’*, *mānasasarovara*, *Bindu-sarovara*, *Nārada kuṇḍa* and *Gaurīkuṇḍa*, bad impressions vanish and good impressions get recorded in the mind. 
4. While taking a bath in the holy waters, if one remembers the virtues of *Jnānis* and their auspicious deeds with the feeling-“This is the water which the *jnānis* have used for bath. As said in ‘सन्मनुष्यमनो यथा’, their minds are pellucid. They are free from the dirt of the *guṇas viz., rajas* and *tamas*. They dwell in a *Śuddhātma* who is free from *vikāras.*” And, by remembering their holy deeds, bad *samskāras* vanish and good *samskāras* arise. 
5. Also, chanting of holy *mantras* while bathing helps in routing bad impressions, and good impressions get imprinted on the mind. 
6. If auspicious feelings are mixed in the waters \(to be used for bathing\) after a good *Saṅkalpa*, then the bath becomes not just a dip in the water in the physical sense, but a dip in the holy *atma tīrtha*. “आत्मैव सर्वतीर्थानि” “मन्मनो मीनवन्नित्यं क्रीडत्यानन्दवारिधौ” \(My mind always enjoys in the ocean of bliss like a fish”\) Such sacred feelings are hidden in the above words. 
7. During a dip in the waters, breathing gets stopped \(for a while\). It creates the natural *kumbhaka state* for the *Adhikāris* with a good mindset, and makes their mind immersed in *śubhālambana* \(auspicious support\). The supreme bliss produced from that becomes not just a dip in the water in the physical sense, but a dip that clears all bad impressions undoubtedly. 
8. With the sacred contact of the lotus feet of the *jnānis*, the *tīrthas* are rendered even more great and powerful, to remove sins. “तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि तीर्थभूता हि साधवः” \(*Jnānis* make the *tīrthas* holier. They themselves are *tīrthas,* says *Bhagavān Vyāsa*\). A narrative, popular in the society of saints may be remembered here. A *sādhaka* who was standing near a hermitage of a *Brahmarshi* happened to see some women in dreadful form entering the hermitage. After sometime, he saw some women divinely beautiful women coming out of the *Āśrama*. Stopping them he asked who they are. They said, “We are *Gaṅgā* and other rivers deities. People taking bath in our waters become pure dropping all their sins on us. We became ugly like female demons on taking their sins. But on entering the hermitage of the *Brahmarshi* and staying there with devotion for a while in their presence, we got back our natural divine form.” Then the *sādhaka* asked them—“Then did the *Brahmarshi* get a dreadful from by taking your sins?” “No” they said. “The sins do not touch them at all. They were reduced to ashes by the very sight of *Brahmarshis*.” The *jnānis* untouched by either *puṇya* or *pāpa*, purify them \(the waters\) and make them *tīrthas*, and therefore, those who take bath in the *tīrthas* shed their sins and become pure. 
9. On some occasions, the *brahmajnānis* who visit the *tīrthas*, happen to touch the waters with their divine minds, sights and bodies, and pass into them a divine energy stream with the wish “Let these *tīrthas* acquire the power of ridding bad *samskāras* of people who bathe, for a specific span of time. Let them obtain the capacity to fill good *samskāras* in such people. Let them acquire the capacity to carry them \(the devotees\) to the *Brāhmi* state which is free from *puṇyas* and *papas.*” Those who take bath in such sacred *tīrthas* which are filled with the divine willpower, reap the above said benefits accordingly. 

### Gaṅgā eminence
The eminence of the holy waters of Gaṅgā

The word *Gaṅgā* means something which gives *mukti* \(‘सद्गतिं गमयतीति गङ्गा’\) The word applies to a goddess and also to the river presided over by that goddess. *Śāstras* and traditions openly praise the holy bath in the sacred river in similitude with the \(*dhyāna*\) of that goddess. They profusely praise not just the holy bath in the river and drinking of its sacred water, but also the very sight and the remembrance of it. \(A few of\) such extolling statements are collected as under.

> दृष्टा तु हरते पापं स्पृष्टा तु त्रिदिवं नयेत् ।  
> प्रसङ्गगेनापि या गङ्गा मोक्षदा त्ववगाहिता ॥ 

Even a casual *darśan* of the river removes sins. If one touches it, it leads him to heaven and a holy bath in it leads one to *moksha*.

A person approaching the river for a bath is blessed to obtain with ease the benefits of performing *yajnas* like *Aśvamedha* and *Rājasūya*, with each step he places towards it.

		
> यस्यां स्नानार्थं चागच्छतः पुंसः पदे पदे अश्वमेधराज-  
सूयादीनां फलं न दुर्लभमिति\(भागवत 1-130\) 

*Gaṅgā* is the image of God in the form of water. Worshipping her is equal to the worshipping of the *devatās*. The very same fruits of the *darshan* of God will be obtained by one who even sees the *Gaṅgā*.

> इयमेव शिवस्य तोयरूपा मूर्तिः ।-  
> गङ्गायां पूजितायां तु पूजिताः सर्वदेवताः । 

> यत्फलं जायते पुंसां दर्शनात् परमात्मनः।-  
> तद्भवेदेव गङ्गायाः दर्शने भकिभावतः ॥ 

If one takes a holy bath with *bhakti* in the *Gaṅgā* even once, his entire family \(lineage\) also gets *Sadgati*.

> यैः पुण्यवाहिनी गङ्गा सकृद्भक्त्यावगाहिता ।-  
> तेषां कुलानां लक्षं तु भवात्तारयते शिवा ॥ 

One who inspires others to have a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā* gets blessed with *sadgati*.

> ये गच्छन्ति स्वतो गङ्गां परांश्च प्रेरयन्ति ये ।  
> इह ते सर्वभोगानामन्ते ज्ञानस्य भाजनम् ॥ 

Performing of *yajna*, *dāna*, *tapas* and *japa* on the banks of the *Gaṅgā* causes infinite benefits.

> यज्ञो दानं तपो जप्यं श्राद्धं च सुरपूजनम् ।  
> गङ्गायां यत्कृतं सर्वं कोटिकोटिगुणं भवेत् ॥ 

*Sadgati* is attained invariably by a person who, knowingly or unknowingly, casts off his mortal coil there.

> गङ्गायां ज्ञानतो मुक्त्वा मुक्तिमाप्नोति मानवः ।  
> अज्ञानात् ब्रह्मलोकं च याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥\(कूर्मपुराण\) 

Even remembering her name is itself an act of great religious merit.

> गच्छंस्तिष्ठन् स्वपन् ध्यायन् जाग्रन् भुञ्जन् श्वसन् वदन् ।  
> यः स्मरेत् सततं गङ्गां स च मुच्येत बन्धनात् ॥ 

Even taking a bath directly in the *Gaṅgā* causes *Puṇya*.

		
> गङ्गास्नानफलं ब्रह्मन् गङ्गायामेव लभ्यते ।  
> यथा द्राक्षाफलस्वादो द्राक्षायामेव नान्यतः ॥ 

*Śrī Śaṅkarācārya* says “If a person \(unable to have a bath directly in the *Gaṅgā*\) chants the thousand names of the river \(*Gaṅgāsahasranāma*\), he earns spiritual rewards equivalent to the act of having a holy bath in the sacred *Gaṅgā*. Drinking even a drop of holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* leads to immortality. Even the banks of the *Gaṅgā* are very sacred.”

> गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता ।\(भजगोविन्द स्तोत्र\)  
> गङ्गातीरमनुत्तमं हि सकलम् ॥\(मणिकर्णिकाष्टक\) 

### Gaṅgā - ailments and health 
2. The power of Gaṅgā to cure ailments and to bestow health.

Many Ayurvedic texts tell us that, besides absolving people of sins, and blessing with *Sadgati*, the water of *Gaṅgā* is very tasty, removes a number of diseases, and helps to acquire good health.

“All the rivers which take their origin on the slopes of the *Himālaya* mountains have medicinal value. Their waters consumed by *devarshis* are really beneficial” says *Caraka*.

> हिमवत्प्रभवाः पथ्याः पथ्याः देवर्षिसेविताः । 

The prince of ayurvedic physicians by name *Cakrapāṇidatta*, confirms this view point.

“यथोक्तलक्षणहिमवत्प्रभवत्वादेव गाङ्गं पथ्यम् ।” 

*Vagbhata’s Ashṭāngahṛdaya* also states that these \(rivers\) do have medicinal properties, and are enduring *tīrthas*.

> “हिमवन्मलयोद्भूताः पथ्यास्ता एव च स्थिराः ।” 

A work by name *Bhojanakutūhala* showers rains of praises thus:-*“Gaṅgatīrtha* is cool, sweetish, clean, very tasty, suitable to health, digestive, improves digestion, removes sins, relieves thirst, quells infatuation, increases appetite and sharpens the intellect.”

> शीतं स्वादु स्वच्छमत्यन्तरुच्यं पथ्यं पाक्यं पाचनं पापहारि ।  
> तृष्णामोहध्वंसनं दीपनं च प्रज्ञां धत्ते वारि भागीरथीजम् ॥ 

### Modern views 
Views on the quality \(properties\) of Gaṅgā by people belonging to other religions, and experiments by modern physicians and their opinions.

History tells us that the healthy qualities of the waters of *Gaṅgā* have attracted not just the Hindus, but the followers of other religions also who were cognizant of its use and were dxiligently consuming it. A travelogue writer by name Iben Batuta tells that Mohammed Bin Tughlak used to get *Gaṅgā* water from Doulathabād regularly. And it would take forty days to reach him. \(Gibb’s Translation, P. 183\)

A book pertaining to Akbar by name Ayine Akbari tells that Akbar considered *Gaṅgatīrtha* on par with nectar. He was drinking it both at home and during travel. He had appointed trusted officers to get him sealed *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Though water from river *Yamunā* or rainwater was used for cooking purposes, a small quantity of water from *Gaṅgā* was being added to that. Not just Akbar, even the bigot Aurangazeb used to love *Gaṅgātīrtha*. A French physician of those times by name Vernier tells us-“*Gaṅgātīrtha* is being kept along with other food stuff and drinks of the king in Delhi and Agra. It would be there even in his travels. Camels used to carry it.” “Even Muslim Nawabs stupefied by its healthy properties, were consuming it.”—statements like this can also be seen \(Narrative P. 248\). Gulām Hussain in his book on the history of Bengal writes “No water can be equal to the water of the *Gaṅgā* in sweetness, taste and the quality of lightness. It does not deteriorate even after a long time.” Taivernier says “It would cost two to three thousand rupees to get *Gaṅgātīrtha* from a long distance and to distribute during marriages.” We come across a statement which says that after the Bhūtān War, the Tūshilāmas of Tibet bought land on the shores of *Gaṅgā* and built a monastery there. Modern physicians and scholars have conclusively stated after conducting experiments that the water of *Gaṅgā* is curative of ailments and a sure cure for skin diseases and infectious diseases, and it does not get stale like the water of other rivers. One Dr. Nelson has said “*Gaṅgātīrtha* taken from Calcutta and carried to London by ship would be thoroughly pure. But water from Thames would turn stale before it could reach Bombay. When I landed in Agra, I came to know of the astonishing fact that the water of *Gaṅgā* had the property of destroying bacteria.” After conducting research on *Gaṅgātīrtha* Dr. Han Cran declared—“We drew water from the *Gaṅgā* at *Kāsi* from a spot where a lot of dirt was getting collected. It contained cholera spreading germs in lakhs. When we examined the water after six hours, we found that all the cholera germs had died. The same was the result in the water collected at a spot where a dead body was floating. When the cholera causing germs were let into pure water, they found that they had multiplied in large numbers. And when placed in *Gaṅgātīrtha* they became dead within six hours. Therefore we began to use the *Gaṅgātīrtha* now and then for curing diseases.” *Pandit Ṭhakūrdatta Sharma*, a researcher of the periodical *“Amṛtadhāra”* says that experiments have confirmed that *Gaṅgātīrtha* kills cholera germs. One *Kaviraj Pratāp Simha* has cured a number of cholera patients in his clinic treating them with the water of *Gaṅgā*. To the question why cholera does not figure in the list of diseases in Bhutan, he says”—They drink only the water of *Gaṅgā*. They bathe the cholera afflicted patient in the *Gaṅgā* and cool him down. They make him drink *Gaṅgātīrtha* frequently and cure him of the diseases the doctors there say. “Water of the *Gaṅgotri* cures diabetes” “By using *Gaṅgātīrtha* in injections, many diseases have been cured.” the doctors say.

### Gaṅgatīrtha qualities 
A Discussion on the praise of the qualities of *Gaṅgatīrtha*.

**a\) A discussion on its capacity to cure diseases**

		
We have already noted scriptural evidences and also the statements of modern physicians based on experiments, which declare that *Gaṅgatīrtha* has the potential to remove sins and cure physical ailments. Here, some people argue “Only because it has the power to cure bodily ailments and improve health, it is called holy water.” And they comment—“The reason for this belief is the presence of some special chemicals in that water which absorb the bacteria in the water and kill them. The cholera bacteria themselves get dissolved and die in it\! The human body is benefited most by the use of this kind of water\! That is why our ancestors who understood this, called *Gaṅgā* holy and attached religious importance to that.” But this is a wrong opinion. Because, many substances prescribed as medicines which fecilitate health and nourishment are prohibited for consumption when one is healthy. And they are not considered sacred just because they are healthy. On the contrary, persons who pursue spirituality seriously are barred from consuming them, when their health is alright.

**For example:-**‘औषधार्थं पिबेन्मद्यम्’ \(liquor should be consumed as a medicine\) i.e. In some diseases, alchohol should be taken in a certain quantity as medicine. Though recommended as healthy \(in exceptional cases\), alchohol is not considered as sacred. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, a Mahāvaidya, used to say ṝ “Onion and garlic are indeed healthy substances. Raw onion is a good medicine for farmers, who inhale unavoidably dust in the fields. It increases urination and clears the dust collected inside, through urine, and cleans the body. So it is recommended for the farmers, at that time. Garlic removes rheumatism and improves digestion. It is a best remedy for diseases of rheumatism and indigestion.” He also used to caution “But these \(onions and garlic\) are not helpful for those who pursue spiritual life. So, they should not be consumed by people whose inclination is mainly towards spirituality.” Thereore, it is not correct to say that all those things that contribute to health can annihilate sins. And there is no substance in the argument that *Gaṅgā* came to be considered as sacred only because of its capacity to cure ailments.

Many ancient and modern physicians have proclaimed by experiments that *Gaṅgātīrtha* has the capacity to cure many diseases. But we have to come to a conclusion in this matter only after examining their opinions, and arguments of objections.

Now, argument that the water of *Gaṅgā* does not cure diseases, but causes diseases: “*Gaṅgā* is clean only at the place of its origin, and only for a few kilometers further. In all other places, it is a stream of filth and pollution. It’s water is full of filth and it is nothing but an open drain and stinking gutters. It is a godown of bacteria.”

The reasons for these are as follows. Dangerous chemicals and effluents from many industries join *Gaṅga* river in plenty exereting urine and faces on its banks is common. Animals are washed in those waters. During festivals, thousands of people take bath at the same place, and the dirt of their bodies collects in the river. In pilgrimage centers like *Kāśī*, half burnt corpses are thrown in abundance into the river, spoiling the water further. Therefore river *Gaṅgā* is one of the most polluted rivers of our country. Germs which cause typhoid, cholera, gastroeneteritis, hepatitis and tapeworms in the stomach, spread by consuming \(drinking\) that polluted water.” This is the statement issued by an organization called *Gāndhi Śāntipīṭha*. A research work in 1976 by physicians has reported that the water of river *Gaṅgā* is unfit for consumption. We cannot refute this opinion which is based on medical research. But there is also a statement from physicians which says-“Abundant bacteria in the water was noticed by us. But we also noticed that after six hours all the germs had died.” These are opinions that have come up at different times. We need to find out the quality of water only by scientific examination from time to time. Contextually, it has to be noted that generally all rivers are naturally gifted with the property of purifying their waters.

#### Self purifying rivers
The natural capacity of rivers to purify themselves

Generally all rivers naturally purify their water themselves. Scientists explain it in a book \(*Holasu Tumbida namma nadigalu—BSN\)* as follows:-In rivers, bacteria which clean water are also present. There are two types of bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. Bacteria belonging to the first type thrive on oxygen. The bacteria of the second type abhor vital air and live without oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria destroy the solid substances at the bottom of the stream, and the one of the other variety destroy the substances on the surface of water. And these bacteria devour even organic matter that are present in filthy water. When they enter the body of the bacteria those organic matters get converted into inorganic matter. They wont decay. They cause no harm. Moreover, some of the single cell bacteria present in the water destroy disease causing germs in the filth. “Aerobic bacteria take away the oxygen dissolved in water which is their food. Is it not harmful?”, one may ask. The answer is, even if oxygen is lost like that, the rivers draw oxygen present in the atmosphere to make up for the loss. And also, the algae in the water produce oxygen by photosynthesis, and supply it to the bacteria.

When the organic matter get reduced in the river water, the aerobes get reduced in number because of lack of food. Then the river increases its oxygen content by absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere. But if the amount of filth in the water is too much, the process of purification slows down. Because, the bacteria that devour the organic matter coming with the filth in large numbers, grow in large quantities and empty the oxygen content \(in the river\). The river by itself cannot make good this enormous loss of oxygen. Then the aerobes and the bacteria-killing single celled organisms, die due to lack of oxygen. Then the entire river becomes a settlement of the aerobes. They get a lot of food, and, oxygen that is inimical to them will also be not present there. Therefore they multiply on the surface of water. In addition to this, they release a foul smelling black coloured toxic gas called hydrogensulphide to water, and render it black and stinking. They cause the vegetation in the river to die. The fish in the water also die because of the lack of sufficient oxygen. And the entire river gets polluted.

This is the capacity of rivers to purify themselves commonly seen. Since *Gaṅgā* flows across medicinal plants and herbs, its capacity to destroy germs and to purify may be greater. Even then, if the river is dumped with filth all the time beyond a limit, the above purification capability may get weakned.

####  Preview of the argument

Simply because river *Gaṅgā* is getting overpolluted and becoming an abode of diseases due to our own thoughtlessness, it does not mean that the statement that *Gaṅgātīrtha* is by itself is disease-resistant and health-promoting is untrue. If unwise persons mix poison with nectar like milk and meet with death, it does not go to falsify the statement that milk by itself is nectar like.

It is an act of great sin to pollute river waters with sewage. Even while bathing in the rivers, we should not let our body dirt into them. Bath should be taken elsewhere and, with a pure body and mind, one should take a dip in river waters with the feeling that it is a sacred water flowing from the holy feet of the Lord. While proclaiming these words, we feel horripilated to remember the great value attached to the purification of river water by our *śāstras*. We should decry ourselves for the heinous act of letting various filths into the waters of great rivers without an iota of hesitation\! This is indeed the result of deviating from the dos and don’ts prescribed by *jnānis*, and it is nothing but the crookedness of the mind to add filth to the flow of river waters, advancing the ruse that the rivers are gifted with the capacity to purify themselves. Rivers by themselves remove the filth accumulated unavoidably. But the offence of adding filth to them should not be commited from our side. It is not wrong to cleanse and purify polluted rivers scientifically without causing damage to their properties. It should necessarily be taken up even if it may cost much, as the great benefit of health is obtained thereby.

A story goes like this-Someone said that sewage should not be let into the *Gaṅgā* and dead bodies should not be thrown into its waters. Goddess *Gaṅgā* appeared in their dream and said-“Why do you insult my greatness? Have you no belief in the fact that I have the capacity to destroy any filth of any quantity? You have no right to tell that filth or dead bodies should not be let into my waters” The truth of this story is worth discussing. This goes against the principle that we have to take a holy bath in a river and not the mere bath that removes dirt from the body. It is common sense to know that a holy great river which is to be worshipped as a goddess should not be polluted, either with body filth or with the filth of mind. We can see that as a rule, even idols of gods are cleaned before giving them a bath and then they are given an *Abhisheka* with *pañcāmṛta* and *śuddhodaka*. When we look at this, it can be understood that it is not wrong to purify scientifically and consume the waters of rivers, which are like deities.

To conclude, it can be said that the water of *Gaṅgā* by itself, has the special capacity to cure ailments. This matter has been established by experiments. We should profit from this god given gift. But it is a great sin to deliberately add poison to this nectar and commit an offence against divinity and the living beings, who use its water. It should be given up. We should safeguard the purity of this great river which is a gift of god and accomplish our purity also.

1. The argument that *Gaṅgātīrtha* has the capacity to cure illness, is just an idea of sentimental origin.

Answer: *Gaṅgātīrtha* has an uncommon ability to cure diseases. In the *Mānasasarovaratīrtha,* which is it’s origin, and in its tributaries such as *Alakanandā*, *Mandākinī* and also in the great water streams of *Gaṅgā* which is formed by the confluence of the above rivers, there exists a potential to cure indigestion, sloth, some types of fever and some contagious diseases, and the water of *Gaṅgā* is a nourishing drink. These facts have been established by the experiments of many physicians. But one Dr. Kovoor of recent times, has stated that there is nothing special about *Gaṅgātīrtha,* and he states that this is proved by his experience. He gives an example of an incident that occurred in his life.

“When I set out for Kolkata from Kerala for further studies, Hindus in my village had requested me to bring the holy water from *Gaṅgā*. But on reaching Calcutta, it was nauseating to see the dirty water of *Gaṅgā*. My conscience did not agree to give this water to the devout people, which could cause diseases from germs. On my return journey from Kolkata, I took some water from a well in a railway station near my village and gave it to the village people telling them that it is the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* which was requested for. Many people who drank that water came to me and shared their experiences.—“We are grateful to you. Just by drinking a few drops of that *Gaṅgātīrtha,* my chronic illness vanished. My sister also was relieved of such and such an evil.” So it can be established that, the above said cure became possible only by faith cure and there is nothing special about *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Because, I had not given them the real *Gaṅgātīrtha* at all” This has been put forth by him as a proof \(Be gone Godmen\)

We do not say that the incident quoted by him is untrustworthy. But the conclusion drawn by him is unscientific because, he has not stated what exactly was the effect of consuming *Gaṅgātīrtha*. The only thing that is conveyed by the incident is that a good effect was the result because some well water was consumed with the faith that it was *Gaṅgātīrtha*. So, *Gaṅgā* came to be invoked in some \(ordinary\) water, with a full faith that it was *Gaṅgā*, though it was actually not *Gaṅgātīrtha*. Thus, the fact that there is great power even in sentimental *Gaṅgā*, has become loudly clear.

In reality, *Gaṅgā* and other *tīrthas* are present within us. *Jnānis* enjoy bliss by immersing themselves in that internal *Gaṅgā*. The scriptures of *maharshis* declare that the external holy waters \(*tīrthas*\) are instrumental in taking ordinary people to the internal *tīrthas*. “आत्मैव सर्वतीर्थानि”, “यः स्नाति मानसे तीर्थे स याति परमां गतिम्”, “त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा.”

*Śāstras* have prescribed in our *Nityakarmavidhi* itself, that *Gaṅgā* should be invoked in any water used for bathing.

> इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति, शुतद्रि स्तोमं सचता परुष्णिया ।  
> असिक्निया मरुद्वृधे वितस्तयार्जीकीये शृणु ह्यासुषोमया ॥\(महानारायण\) 

> गङ्गे च यमुने चैव गोदावरि सरस्वति ।  
> नर्मदे सिन्धु कावेरि जलेऽस्मिन् सन्निधिं कुरु ॥ 

Thus, drinking of even sentimental *Gaṅgā* \(water\) can help in the curing of diseases. We have noted previously, that not only sentimental devotees but even discriminating scientists, and people with first hand experience have stated that actual *Gaṅgātīrtha* has even more potential in that regard. It is our responsibility to maintain the holy water of *Gaṅgā* in the natural state and use it for the curing of both mental and physical ailments.

####  The redemptive power
The redemptive power of *Gaṅgā:* An explanation

Let us agree for the moment that clean *Gaṅgātīrtha* when consumed, can cure diseases. But how to believe that it has redemptive power? Doing worship of God and following the path of *dharma* is known to redeem one’s sins. How can it happen just by drinking water from a river? If sins are redeemed just by drinking water, then the fish, crocodiles and other acquatic creatures that always live in water must be more blessed than human beings, isn’t it? This question naturally arises here. The answer for this can be found by recollecting what Śrīraṅgamahāguru had expounded about the meaning of pāpa and puṇya.

*Pāpa* and *Puṇya* are *samskāras* that are imprinted on the gramophone plate of the mind. The marks which cause misery or misfortunes are called sins and the marks that lead to happiness are called *puṇya*.

The marks of sins disturb the mind, make it impure and cause agitation. They incense the *dhātus* and cause anger in the mind. The impressions of *puṇya* generate waves which dissipate agitation and impurity, and help to attain a state of happiness.

One who has *samskāras* of sins may appear healthy outside, but his *dhātus* remain irritated in the inner layers of his nature. When this agitation within is gone and tranquility prevails, it can be understood that the marks of evil have vanished and sins are removed. It is established by experiment that when holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* is taken with the right disposition mind, the above said effect takes place. When a person sees holy *Gaṅgātīrtha*, takes a holy dip in it and drinks that sacred water, the abnormal nature vanishes and the tranquility of *dhātus* manifests. This can be clearly known by those who are in the path of self realization and the ones who possess the knowledge of the body and corporeal science.

This effect will be there even on ordinary people, at least in small proportions. When this pleasantness of *dhātus* is accomplished completely, then the very realization of *Brahman* occurs as proclaimed by the *Upanishads* in the words “धातुप्रसादत् महिमनमीशम्.” Just as the above said result \(i.e. the pleasantness of *dhātus*\) happens from *tapas* and meditation etc., it also happens in a measure, by drinking the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha*. And that is why it is valued greatly. Thus, as the drinking of the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* causes attainment of the *brahmī* state, it may be called a destroyer of sins, without any doubt.

#### Mechanism of sin-removal
The ways in which the taking of *Gaṅgātīrtha* results in the removal of sins.

A\) Drinking of *Gaṅgātīrtha* causes the removal of ailments and thereby becomes instrumental in the tranquility of the self. Only a healthy person indeed can meditate well says an ayurvedic aphorism.

“अनामयी यावदात्मानं सम्मन्यते” 

Ill health is unnatural and a stronger. It is surely a result of sin. The holy water that removes sins should be indeed called a redeemer. Ill health is the fruit of sins committed during previous lives. *Āyurveda* states “पूर्वजन्मकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते.” The modern medical science has clearly demonstrated that diseases are caused by bacteria. Then, is it not blind faith to say that ill health is a result of sins?-To come to a judgment on a matter without pondering over it right from its origin, is also blind faith. It is not wrong to say that bacteria causes diseases. But to conclude that bacteria alone are the root cause for all diseases is not correct. They happen to be the cause in the intermediate phase. Bacteria can cause illness only when our body becomes weak due to the imbalance caused by *Vāta, pitta* and *kapha* in our system. They cannot cause any disease in the body of a person who possesses a state of balanced *dhātus* and who is robust. Bacteria of the same type and same number, can cause diseases to some, and cannot cause diseases to some others. Therefore the root cause of diseases is the rage \(imbalance\) of *dhātus* in our body system. *Āyurveda* says that the marks that cause the imbalance are nothing but sins and so, sins are responsible for diseases. Thus, *Gaṅgātīrtha* which is capable of correcting the unevenness in dispositions and removing ailments, is indeed the redeemer of sins.

The *Himālayas* abound in medicinal plants, herbs and mountain born minerals. It is natural that *Gaṅgā* which flows across all these, has the power to cure ailments.

B\) *Gaṅgātīrtha* relieves one of sloth and infuses spiritual inspiration. It brings about great happiness of the mind. The cognizance of this comes to the mind only because the marks of sins get washed away.

c\) The blemishes which distort the mind are called sins. How *Gaṅgātīrtha* is capable of removing them, has to be discussed here.

As the Holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* has had the contact of sacred most people, it brings to our mind sacred memories. “Lord *Rudra deva* performed penance in *Rudraprayāg* a on the banks of the holy *Gaṅgā*, regularly drinking its water. *Nara* and *Nārāyaṇa* \(*Arjuna* and Lord *Kṛshṇa*\), did *tapasyā* in the hermitages on the banks of this *Gaṅgā* river consuming this *tīrtha* regularly. They performed fire sacrifices at a place called *Daśāśvamedha* on its banks. The seven *ṛshis* perform rituals in its water Great sages like *Nārada, Vyāsa*, and *Vālmīki* have consumed its holy water.”—When such holy memories come to our mind, bad impressions vanish.

#### Divine and grand reminiscences.

A holy dip in *Gaṅgā* brings to our memory all that has been said in the holy *Vedas, purāṇas*, history and great literary works based on them, which describe the holy bath, the holy men and the power of *Gaṅgā*. These reminiscences will erase all the sinful *samskāras* in our dispositions and purify our mind, intellect and senses.

For example, in the beginning of OM it adorned the water pot of Lord *Brahma*.

‘आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलम्’ It is the sacred water that flowed from the holy feet of Lord *Vishṇu.* “पश्चात्पन्नगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम्” “विष्णुपादोद्भवा गङ्गा” “विष्णुपादात्परिभ्रष्टं प्लावयित्वेन्दुमण्डलम्” “तत्र भगवतः साक्षाद्यज्ञलिङ्गस्य विष्णोर्विक्रमतो वामपादाङ्गुष्ठनखनिर्भिन्नोर्ध्वाण्डकटाहविवरेणान्तः प्रविष्टा या बाह्यजलधारा. . . . साक्षाद्भगवत्पदीति’ “अथाङ्घ्रये प्रोन्नमिताय विष्णोः उपाहरत्पद्मभुवोऽर्हणादिकम्” “धातुः कमण्डलुजलं तदुरुक्रमस्य” “पादावनेजन पवित्रतया नरेन्द्र” “स्वर्धुन्यभून्नभसि सा पतिता निर्मार्ष्टि” “लोकत्रयं भगवतो विशदेव कीर्तिः” It is the holy *tīrtha* that found a blessed abode in the knot of har \(on top of the head\) of the Lord of Lords *\(Śiva\)*

“भूयो शम्भुजटाविभूषणमणिः” ‘भवाङ्गपतितं तोयं पवित्रमिति पस्पृशुः” “निपपात ततो गङ्गा धन्ये शिवशिरस्युत” “नैव सा निर्गमं लेभे जटामण्डलमोहिता” “तच्छङ्करशिरोभ्रष्टं भ्रष्टं भूमितले पुनः । व्यरोचत तदा तोयं निर्मलं गतकल्मषम्” “It is the holy *tīrtha* that came out of the opening of the ear of *Jahnuṛshi*.” “ततो हि यजमानस्य जह्नोरद्भुतकर्मणः । ततस्तुष्टो महातेजाः श्रोत्राभ्यामसृजत्पुनः” It is the holy water which incarnated on the earth as a result of the grace of god bestowed on *Bhagīratha* for his penance. “इयं च दुहिता श्रेष्ठा तव गङ्गा भविष्यति” गङ्गा त्रिपथगा नाम दिव्या भागीरथीति च”

We come across such sayings in the stories of *Gaṅgā’*s descent \(to earth\). Among these, Lord *Brahma* is the divine entity, who keeps on performing the work of, creation while he remains unchanged.

एतन्मतं समातिष्ठ परमेण समाधिना । भवान्कल्पविकल्पेषु न विमुह्यति कर्हिचित्” ॥ “सर्वभूतमयो विश्वं ससर्जेदं स पूर्ववत्” *Mahāvishṇu* is the changeless supreme *Brāhmaṇ*. “अविकाराय शुद्धाय नित्याय परमात्मने । सदैकरूपरूपाय विष्णवे सर्वजिष्णवे” Mahādeva is *Parameśvara* \(Lord of Lords\). “विष्णुर्यथैकः पुरुषोत्तमः स्मृतः महेश्वरस्त्र्यम्बक एव नापरः” Sage *Jahnu* is a *Brahmīshṭha* who is absorbed in the bliss of meditation in the matted hair of Lord *Mahādeva. Bhagīratha* is a *Rājarshi* who by his highly astonishing penance visualized the Lord of lords, and caused the holy contact of *Gaṅgā* to his manes, to himself, and also to the world. When the flow of sentiments concerned with these great personages makes movement within us, the evil marks viz. the sins, dwelling in our dispositions get undoubtedly washed out.

#### The holy water used by great men.

From times immemorial many *Brahmajnānis*, *Satyakāmas, Satyasaṅkalpas* and *Siddhas* have taken a holy dip in this river. They, who are holy by themselves, in the pretext of making a pilgrimage to *Gaṅgā*, have consumed its water and enhanced its holiness. With the words “May the sins of those who take this water \(with devotion\) vanish,” they have added their divine will power to it. Because of this power also, the sins of people who take it persish,—“भवद्विधा भागवतास्तीर्थभूताः स्वयं विभो । तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि स्वान्तस्थेन गदाभृता” “प्रायेण तीर्थाभिगमापदेशैः स्वयं हि तीर्थानि पुनन्ति सन्तः” ।

> सनन्दनाद्या नरदेवयोगिनः  
> ववन्दिरे यत्स्मरणानुभावतः  
> स्वायम्भुवं धामगता अकर्मकम्”  
> “ततः सप्तर्षयः तत्प्रभावज्ञा यां ननु तपसः

### Representative of Principles-a symbol

“The river of *jnāna* and *dharma* itself is the spiritual *Gaṅgā*. This is nothing but the image of God in the form of water.”-So say the *jnānis*. Also, we come across compositions of *jnānis* which express the following sense.-“The *Idā* nādī in our body is *Gaṅgā*. *Piṅgalā* is *Yamunā* and *Sushumnā* is *Sarasvatī*. And the place of confluence of these three viz. the place of meditational immersion between eyebrows \(*bhrūmadhya* is nothing but the *tīrtharājaprayāga*.”

“काशीक्षेत्रं शरीरं त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा”  
> “सेयं जलमयी मूर्तिः शिवस्य परमेशितुः”  
> धर्मस्रोतोऽवहं तीर्थं शिवं कल्मषनाशनम्”  
> “इडा भागीरथीनाम्नी पिङ्गला यमुनानदी ।  
> तयोर्मध्ये स्थिता नाडी सुषुम्नाख्या सरस्वती ॥ 

*Jnānis* have done the *tattvasamyoga* here in the ascending and descending order, in the following manner—Placing the lucid vision in the river obtained by delving deep in the above said principles, remembering those principles while taking a bath in the river, and again delving in the principles.

We come across statements in scriptures which say that all the accumulated sins will get redeemed by taking a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*. “सर्वपापहरां शिवाम्.” We also see statements such as “A person bereft of spiritual knowledge, cannot attain salvation by any means, even if he takes a holy bath in the *Gaṅgā*, or performs rituals or offers great gifts. “कुरुते गङ्गासागरगमनं व्रतपरिपालनमथवा दानम् । ज्ञानविहीनः सर्वमतेन मुक्तिं न भजति जन्मशतेन” These two statements appear to be contradictory. But when seen in the background of the above *tattvasamyoga* principles, they concur with each other. Undoubtedly, the evil impressions present in our inner and outer nature get washed out and the divine knowledge in the form of bliss, and *dharma* which is its natural disposition, flow naturally in us, if *Gaṅgātīrtha* is taken with the faith that it is a spring of *jnāntattva* and *dharmatattva*.

### The map of tattvas

Śrī Raṅgamahāguru used to expound-“The basin of Gaṅgā and the holy pilgrimages along its banks are indeed the maps drawn in the land of Bhārata by mother nature. This can be made clear by one or two examples.

Lord *Mahādeva*, who had held *Gaṅgā* captive in his head, laid her down at *Bindusaras,* to bless *Bhagīratha*. We see in the *Rāmāyaṇa* that the river branched into seven streams while descending.

विससर्ज ततो गङ्गां हरो बिंदुसरः प्रति ।  
“तस्यां विसृज्यमानायां सप्तस्रोतांसि जज्ञिरे ॥ 

ह्लादिनी पावनी चैव नलिनी च तथोऽपरा ।  
तिस्रः प्राचीं दिशं जग्मुः गङ्गागाश्शिवजलाश्शुभाः ॥ 

> सुचक्षुश्चैव सीता च सिन्धुश्चैव महानदी ।  
तिस्रस्त्वेता दिशं जग्मुः प्रतीचीं तु शुभोदकाः ।  
> सप्तमी चान्वगात्तासां भगीरथमथो नृपम् ॥” 

We can observe a map that conforms to the inner design also, in the external form of *Gaṅgā*. This *Bindu* is an effulgent principle, which can be seen only by the inner vision of the *jnānis*. And *nāda* gets manifested out of that. Then the seven *prāṇas* are created. The universe is created next.

> बिंदोर्नादसमुद्भवः समुदिते नादे जगत्कारणम्”  
> “मध्ये फालं बिन्दुर्दीप इवाभाति वर्तुलाकारः”  
“सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति” 

At the origins of river *Gaṅgā*, we come across a *tīrtha* by name *Gomukha*. This happens to be the map of the principle that is responsible for the origin of speech.

The holy places related to *Gaṅgātīrtha* such as *Brahmakapāla*, *Brahmakunḍa*, *Haridvāra* and many others, belong to this category.

On the banks of Gaṅgātīrtha we see a bathing ghat called Maṇikarṇikā in the Kāśikshetra. Śrī Śaṅkaracārya in his stotra ‘Maṇikarṇikāshṭaka says that both Gods Hara and Hari vie with each other to bestow their world to those who take a bath here. This may sound like a funny story or like an arthavāda \(exaggeration either to praise or to disparage\). But we humbly remember here the explanation bestowed by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, based on his vision of truth and dharma that it is the external form of the philosophical truth \(tāttvik satya\). “Maṇi means God, a self luminous light. The words of the Vedas and also the scholars of the past exhort this. “अन्धो मणिमविन्दत्, तमनङ्गुलिरावयत्” “चिन्तारत्नं सुलभमिह नः” “आराधयामि मणिसन्निभमात्मलिङ्गम्” There are two nādīs associated with the place of vision of that luminous light within. One nādī takes a person to the abode of Vishṇu and the other to the abode of Śiva.” This was the description graced by ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru. The jnānis have given this name to it \(i.e Maṇikarṇika\) because the river Gaṅgā has formed two beds resembling the passage of these two nādīs.

Thus, *Gaṅgā* is chosen by Mother nature, as an important ‘line’ to draw the map of the abode of *tattva*. Those who take a dip at some special nodal centres of this line with their mind immersed in the divine meaning will travel in the abode of those principles only. With this, \(it can be known that\) *Gaṅgā* is giving a message to both intellectuals and sentimental people, that they should give up the path carved out by the evil, and take the path of the aforesaid maps.

In this article on *Akhshayatṛtīyā*, the discussion on the *Gaṅgā* has occupied a large part. Though this may appear to be an encroachment on the discussion of *Akshayatṛtīyā*, a lengthy analysis of *Gaṅgā* was necessitated because, this is a very important and useful matter in the study of all festivals, where the taking of the holy *Gaṅgātīrtha* is prescribed. Now, we shall attempt answering some important questions regarding *Gaṅgā*, as a remaining part of this discussion.

### The forms and features of Goddess *Gaṅgā*.

*Āgamas*, history and *purāṇas* proclaim Goddess *Gaṅgā* as a river of divine knowledge, a stream of *dharma* and an embodiment of the supreme power of the Almighty. In the *dhyānaśloka* of that river, it is described that *Gaṅgā* has a unique third eye, holds a lotus, a pot and a rosary in her hands, sports *varadamudrā*, and has a crocodile as her vehicle.

> सितमकरनिषण्णां शुभ्रवर्णां त्रिनेत्राम् ।  
> करधृतकमलाक्षां कुम्भहस्तेष्टमुद्राम् ॥ 

Are these just fantasies of a poet, or can there be a form of a deity with the above said paraphernalia? This is the first question.

### Ordinary view
Answers coming from an ordinary vision

When viewed ordinarily, these appear to be the forms imagined by a poet. “As *Gaṅgā* is in the form of a river, a water filled pot is placed in her hand. The small quantity of water that can be filled in the *kalaśa*, later expands and flows as a great river.

“The term *tīrtha* also means *āgama* or *vidyā* \(निपानागमयोस्तीर्थं\). To suggest that the garland of letters i.e. the alphabet is the mother of all learning, the poet has presented an *akshamāla* \(rosary\) in one of her hands.

		
“As the lotus is the best of flowers born in water, a beautiful lotus has been placed in the hand of the goddess of holy water. The waves of the river are her hands. The shining fish are the many eyes of the goddess. As she is a great sustainer of the livelihood of people, she is fancied as one who sports the right hand in the blessing posture. As crocodiles abound in the river, a crocodile has been shown as her vehicle.”—Such answers come to the minds of the sentimental people.

### Exrta-ordinary view
Answers that are perceptible to the extraordinary vision

But, when the disposition \(of a person\) is purified and the *tattvas* are pursued with an inner vision, it can be realized that they \(the form of *Gaṅgā* and the parapheralia\) are not mere imageries but sublime forms that are clearly and naturally visible in the divine ground. In the chapter *‘Devatā vigrahatattvādhikaraṇa* of the *Brahmasūtras*, the subject matter viz., whether the gods have forms or not, has been discussed, and it has been established that they do have forms. And, just because of this, one need not believe that \(gods have forms\). It should be clearly understood that they are forms which have been seen, being seen and are going to be seen, directly, by pious persons who undertake a spiritual inward journey in the body called *Brahmapura*. Also, it is not impossible that those principles and their paraphelnalia could be seen manifestly, by the will of God who is the almighty, *Satyakāma* and *Satyaksaṅkalpa*.

“They are the forms seen and described by the yogis”—these are the words of ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru the great yogi par excellence, who uttered from his own experience, and we remember them here with reverence.

The upward facing lotus which has adorned the hand of the holy *Gaṅgā*, is the thousand petalled lotus of the *yogis*. It has blossomed by the golden rays of the sun of divine knowledge. Even the *Kamanḍalu* in the shape of a lotus facing upwards held in her hand, is filled with the nectar of divine knowledge. The rosary is the canon of the universe. The beads in that are the principles under her control. Her shining eyes are not the representatives of the fickle fish. They are the steady eyes of a *jnāni*. Among them, in the middle, is the bright upward eye that is similar to the third eye in the region of the forehead of Lord *Mahādeva*.

अन्तर्लक्ष्यं बहिर्दृष्टिः निमेषोन्मेषवर्जिता ।  
> एषा सा शाम्भवी \(वैष्णवी\) मुद्रा सर्वतन्त्रेषु गोपिता ॥ 

\(Even though the eyes appear opened, the focus is inside. There is no movement of the eyelids. This is a *mudrā* called *Shāmbhavī mudrā-Vaishṇavī mudrā*, which is esoteric in all the *tantras*\)-This is precisely described in the *śāstras*. Anyhow her lotus, *Kamanḍalu*, eyes etc., have all taken the upward path, as can be seen in the words. “ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्थाः”

Now, about her vehicle *makara*. It is nothing but *avidyā*, which by its sharp jaws slashes the poor ignorant souls into pieces and devours them. But that goddesses of *vidyā*, who is an embodiment of divine knowledge, has conqured it and has transformed it as an instrument that takes the devotees to her divine abode. The *Upanishads* proclaim that ignorance can be a ladder that dismounts one to death, and can also be a boat which can make \(the souls\) to cross the \(ocean\) of death, and elevate them to immortality.

> “अविद्यया मृत्युं तीर्त्वा विद्ययामृतमान्ते”\(ईशोपनिषत्\) 

They acquire the above said second power when they come under the command of a *guru* who has a penetrating wisdom. In the present context, the *makara* which symbolizes the *avidya*, has almost obtained that capacity, as it has come under the rule of the goddess of *Vidya*. Because of the association with that goddess who is an embodiment of *Śuddhasattva* and who looks comely with her pure white complexion, even that crocodile has turned white.

### Some problems
Some problems posed by the stories relating to *Gaṅgā*:

The *Gaṅgā* is a river which takes its birth at the top of the *Himālayas*. Let us believe that its water has the power to cure a number of ailments. But *Itihāsas, purāṇas* and *āgamas* pronounce strange statements about the river. “It is the holy water which was in the *Kamanḍalu* of *Brahma Deva.* When he \(i.e. *Brahma*\) the Lord of *Satyaloka*, washed the lotus feet of *Trivikrama Nārāyaṇa*, *Gaṅgā* took birth \(there\). There-after, she ascended the head of *Śiva* the most auspicious, and later, due to the efforts of the great ascetic *Bhagīratha*, she was made to descend to the earth and the nether worlds. She also happened to flow out of the ears of the sage *Jāhnu*. The gods took her, who was a sibling of *Umā,* to heavens for their work.” We come across such statements about her origin \(*Rāmāyaṇa* 1-53 to 65-*Śrīmadbhāgavata* 8-21\).

Many questions arise here about these stories. Are they not imaginary stories? There is no unanimity also in them. Is it true that *Gaṅgā* descended from heaven to the earth? Or Is it true that it was taken from the earth to the heaven? On the contrary, if *Gaṅgā* is a river of divine knowledge, should she not always stay in the head of lord *Śiva* a *jnāni*? Did it become empty in its origin, when it descended to earth? We hear that *Gaṅgā* became arrogant, imagining that she would even wash *Śiva* away by Jumping down on his head. Then *Śiva* arrested her in his matted hair and made her roam about there only. If so, can there be arrogance even in the power of God?

One more question invades us-*Gaṅgā* is the holy water of Lord *Vishṇu’s* feet. The statement that *Siva* bore it on his head, could be only a part of a story composed by devotee poets, to show the difference between *Śiva* and *Vishṇu*.

It has to be noted here that the solution for the questions pertaining to topics related to the visualization of *Gaṅgā* within, should be searched only in the *jnānabhūmi* and not in the sphere of intellectual gymnastic. A brief answer will be provided hereby, in the background of the upadeśa of our Gurudeva who has travelled in all the relevant spheres.

#### Brief Answers

*Śāstras* state that *Gaṅgā* is associated with the Trinity-famously known as *Brahma, Vishṇu* and *Maheshvara*.The philosophical meaning of this is that all these three gods are forms of *jnāna*, and they also bestow *jnāna*. *Gaṅgā* is the nectar of the divine knowledge filled in the vessel of the will of creation of Lord *Brahma* who is thoroughly proficient in the *Vedas*. She is the nectar of the divine knowledge dwelling in the head of Lord *Śiva*, which is the abode of *jnāna* of *Sadāśiva* who is the annihilator, super universal, and the embodiment of divine knowledge. She is the ambrosia of the nectar of the upward going lotus foot of *Urukrama*-*Trivikrama* praised by *Purushasūkta* as “पादोऽस्य विश्वा भूतानि, त्रिपादस्यामृतं दिवि” As all these three are \(different\) modes of the almighty, taking refuge in any one of these results indeed in the obtaining of *jnānāmṛta.*

The *Vaishṇava purāṅas* say that *Śiva* came to be known in the true sense of the word, on bearing *Gaṅgā* in his head, who was in the feet of *Vishṇu*. “पादोदकेन स शिवः स्वशिरोधृतेन” The purport of this is to state *Vishṇu’s* supremacy. Similarly *Śaiva Purāṇas* say that *Vishṇu* engaged himself in searching for the feet of *Śiva*. This is to state the supremacy of *Śiva*. But actually speaking, the *tattva* of the statement that *Gaṅgā* belongs to *Vishṇu’s* feet and the head of *Śiva*, should be understood in the *Yogamārga* only. The place of *Nārāyaṇa* is *Sahasrāra*. The place of *Rudradeva* is the midpoint of the eyebrows. This entire region is the abode of *jnānatīrtha* which is the redeemer. This can also be termed as, “The origin of *jnānaGaṅgā* is the feet of *Nārāyaṇa* and the head of *Śiva* is its expanse.” This is the principle here.

The feet i.e. the tread ofLord *Nārāyaṇa* who is known as *Tripadvibhūti* fills the three worlds viz *bhū*, *bhuvas* and *suvar* and crossing even them, covers the upper \(regions\). When the foot \(of *Nārāyaṇa*\) comes to the abode namely *Vyāhrti* it is natural that God *Brahma* who is its Lord, worshipped it. But the upward foot of the Lord doesn’t stop just at that place viz *Satya*, but rests in the place of supreme effulgent light \(*paranjyothi*\) proclaimed as *‘Satyasya satyam* in the *Upanishads*. This is the principle here. Our respectful *Pradakshiṇa namaskāras* to that *jnānaGaṅgā* who, after participating in the *Sṛshti*, *sthiti* and *laya* and later has positioned herself in the fourth and the superfourth state, which is beyond the commotion of those three \(viz *sṛshṭi*, *sthiti*, and *laya*\)

*Gaṅgā*, who jumped down on the head of *Śiva*, is his infinite power. Lord *Śiva* is the possessor of power. “परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च” “अखिलशक्तिधरः स्वधाम्ना” When a power competes against the sustainer of power, it has to face defeat. “तेन कोऽर्हति स्पर्धितुं” The principle that God is capable of both arresting and also releasing that power, is proclaimed by the story of *Gaṅgā* getting entrapped in the matted hair of Lord *Śiva*.

A *Brahmajnāni’s* right ear is the refuge for knowledge and also the path for the flow of currents of sound which is endowed with divine knowledge. This truth is expounded by the statement of the sages “ब्रह्मण आणी स्थः.” The story of sage *Jahnu* the king of *Jnānis* letting out *Gaṅgā* from his right ear proclaims this very same principle.

The right ear is the place by which the hearing of the current of *praṇava* is fecilitated “शृणुयाद्दक्षिणे कर्णे नादमन्तर्गतं शुभम्”

*Gaṅgā* and *Gaurī* are the two modes of divine knowledge of *Mahādeva*. They are together even in the incarnation state, as they are seen in the original state, and therefore we find them in stories as sisters and as daughters of *Himavān*.

*Gaṅgā* is the flow of *jnāna* which always adorns the head of Lord *Siva*. Sheerly to bless the people, he makes a small part of it to descend, and those who take a dip in that are rendered pure and drawn towards the origin of divine knowledge. This is the exposition of the way, by which a *mahāguru* lifts up the devotees.

When we say *Gaṅgā* is the daughter of *Himavān*, it does not mean that an inert entity called water is born of another inert entity called a mountain, as it may seem to the eyes. The purport is that the *jnānadevi* took birth as the daughter of the mountain’s reigning deity, only to bless him and to render him holy. It is also natural that gods took her back to their place for their work, after the purpose of her incarnation got accomplished. In this way, both the descent of *Gaṅgā* from the heaven to the earth, and her ascent to the heaven from the earth match well.

Thus, the stories about *Gaṅgā* found in our *Āgamas, Itihāsas* and *purāṅas* appear just like stories at first sight. But we understand that they are beautiful compositions which expound a *mahātattva* that is eternally true. Those who merge in them, get all their sense organs sanctified.

What should be done by those people who are unable to have a holy bath directly in the *Gaṅgā* on the day of *Akshaya Tṛtīya*? They should sentimentally feel that the water they are going to use for bathing is *Gaṅgātīrtha* itself. The *jnānaGaṅgā* will bestow her divine presence in that water and sanctify them.

We would like to conclude after discussing briefly, the time science and the science of other modalities pertaining to *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, and sing the epilogue for the discussion of the festival. Here *Vijnāna* means knowledge backed by discussion “विविच्य ज्ञानम्” and knowledge distinguished by the inference obtained by the study of cause and effect. “विशिष्टं ज्ञानम्”.
