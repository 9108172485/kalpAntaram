The *Parva* is celebrated on the *śukla tṛtīyā* of *Vaiśākha* which comes only in the *vasantaṛtu*. We have already described in the chapters of *Rāmanavamī* and *Ugādi*, that *Vasanta* among seasons, and *śuklapaksha,* are most commendable for the worship of god, and for rituals relating to gods. Now let us discuss the *māsa*, *tithi* and *nakshatra* of the *parva*.

## Māsa
**A\) *Māsa:*** In the celebration of this festival, barley is prescribed as the main substance for *Havana*, *pūja* and *dāna*. Gifting wheat, Bengalgram and roasted barley powder are also mentioned as the most suitable ones for *dāna*. In our country which is predominantly agricultural, it is only in the month of *vaiśākha* all these \(grains\) become readily available, both for consumption and for sacrificial and religious purposes. Thus the science in \(mentioning\) *Vaiśākha* as the month may be noticed, when all the specific materials required for the ritual of the *parva* are available in plenty.

Further, *Meshasaṅkramaṇa*, the most auspicious time of *Vishuvat* comes in this month only. We have already discussed and explained the importance of this *puṇyakāla*, in the chapter on *Ugādi*. This *saṅkramaṇa* and the time proximate to it, are the most suitable times for worshipping the *pitṛs*. Therefore it has to be noted here that the month of *vaiśākha* is convenient for the observance of *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, which is best for the worship of both *devas* and *pitṛs*. Though the advantage of the spring season is available in *caitra* the month previous to this, there is no guarantee that grains arrive at homes in the ready-to-use form. And also, the *Vishusaṅkramaṇa* does not occur in that month. It \(i.e. *Caitra*\) is considered as a *Kharamāsa* because of the happening of *Mīnasaṅkramaṇa* in that month.

## Tithi
**b\) *Tithi***: The *tithi* of this *parva*, viz. *tṛtīyā* is called *‘Jayātithi’*. And that too, the *Jayātithi* of *Śukla Paksha* is very auspicious.

		
> नन्दा भद्रा जया रिक्ता पूर्णाःस्युः तिथयः पुनः ।  
> पर्यायत्वेन विज्ञेयाः ॥\(पीयूषधारा = नारद वचन\) 

“उदकुम्भान् सकनकान् सान्नान् सर्वरसैः सह ।  
“यवगोधूमचणकान् सक्तु दध्योदनं तथा ॥\(निर्णय सिन्धु\) 

The name *Jayā* indicates that it is the precious time for success, ie the securing of the accomplishment of the endeavours taken up with auspicious intentions.

We have also heard that *tṛtīyā* conjoined with *caturthī tithi* is highly auspicious for this festival. *‘Gaurī Vināyakopetā’*. *Tṛtīyā* is considered to be the *tithi* of goddess *Gauri* who bestows auspiciousness for all living beings, and *caturthī* as the *tithi* of Lord *Gaṇeśa*, the remover of all obstacles. “चतुर्थीगणनाथस्य” गौर्याः तत्पूर्ववासरे” \(Agnipurāṇa\)

The union of these two *tithis* which is dear to these gods \(i.e. Goddess *Gauri* and Lord *Gaṇeśa*\) is indeed \(a time\) which cherishes the removal of obstacles and the accomplishment of auspiciousness, brought about by the tranquility of the said time.

The main reason for laying down that the *tṛtīyā tithi* should extend till noon is because *śuklapaksha* is dear to gods. As it is the domain of the gods, they desire the forenoon only for their worship. Also, in the duration of the day, the forenoon is dear to gods and the afternoon to the *pitṛs*. If any worship is offered in the afternoon of a *śuklapaksha,* it enters the sway of the *pitṛs* typically. So the *śāstras* stipulate only such a *tithi* which has a forenoon pervasion, and as the bright half of a month belongs to the gods, it is commended for worships and rituals.

## Vāra and Nakshatra
**C. *Vāra and Nakshatra***. *Yogis* says that if on that day, there is a conjunction of *Rohiṇī* with either Monday or Wednesday, it is a \(rare\) *Yoga* which is a result of imperishable good deeds. This is because, those two days and *Rohiṇī* are very auspicious days for the worship of Lord *Kṛshṇa*. So, on *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*, it is only *ŚrīKṛshṇa* who is to be specially worshipped after the worship of the *ishṭadevatā* isn’t it?

> यः करोति तृतीयायां कृष्णं चन्दनलेपितम् ।  
> वैशाखस्य सिते पक्षे स यात्यच्युतमन्दिरम् ॥ 

\(We shall explain how the \(conjunction of the\) above said day and star \(*Rohiṇī*\) match well for the worship of *ŚrīKṛshṇa*, in the chapter of *ŚrīKṛshṇa Jayantī.*\)

## Application to the festival

*Śāstras* have prescribed the third day of the *Śuklapaksha* of *Vaiśākha* which happens to be the latter half of the spring season for this festival. It should be noted that all the limbs of the above said time, happen to be highly favourable for the observance of this festival.

The distinction of *Vasanta* renowned as the king of seasons, has been explained in the discussion on *Ugādi*. Pertaining to this festival \(i.e. *Akshaya Tṛtīyā*\) it should be specially noted that grains such as barley, wheat etc., which are necessary for the worship of God and also for the offerings, arrive at homes in a ready-to-use state, in this season.

It is not certain that all those grains in the ripened state arrive at homes in *caitra,* the first month of *Vasanta*. But by *Vaiśākha* they will have surely arrived at homes. As *Vishuvat parva* also occurs in this month, it is a month which is best both for the worship of gods and *pitṛs*.

*Śāstras* say that the entire six months of *Uttarāyaṇa* is the day time for *devas* and the *śuklapaksha* especially is time of their delight and nourishment. In addition to this, if festivals like *Sankramaṇa* and *AkshyaTṛtīyā* also occur, they will be dear to *pitṛs* also. The time that is dear to both of them \(i.e. gods and *pitṛs*\) is the time when the centers connected with them in the temple of the human body blossom. And it is the time when nature gets specially propitious and takes those who worship at that time to the grace of gods easily and swifly. This need not be believed just because a statement is made to that effect. Those who honestly undertake that worship can experience it at the distinct time. The *Tṛtīyā* of this festival is also known by the appropriate name *“Jayā”*. Particularly the *Tṛtīyā of śuklapaksha* is still more auspicious.

> नन्दा भद्रा जया रिक्ता पूर्णाः स्युस्तिथयः पुनः ।  
> पर्यायत्वेन विज्ञेया नेष्टमध्येष्टदा सिते ॥


And if the *Tṛtīyā* which is associated with the all auspicious *Gauri,* and the *caturthī* associated with *vighnādhipa Gaṇeśa* come together, it becomes a festival of great accomplishments.
