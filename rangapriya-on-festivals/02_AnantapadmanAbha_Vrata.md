02 ānantapadmanābha Vrata

\(Anantana Caturdaśī-Anantana Habba\)

**The *Āradhya Deva* of this *Anantana Vrata***

*Ananta Padmanābha Vrata* is one of the auspicious *parvas* observed by a vast number of *sanātana Ārya Bhāratīyas*. It is called *AnantanaVrata* as it is a day of austerity of deity worship, and many precepts of *Vratas* have to be followed on that day. The term *Ananta* means ‘king of serpents’, and also *Ādiśesha* the *Śeshanāga*.

“शेषोऽनन्तो नागराजः”

The meaning of the component parts of this term is ‘the one who has no end’. *Ādiśesha* has this name because he is the form of the *prāṇaśakti* \(*Kuṅḍalini*\) of the Lord, who has infinite power.

This term *Ananta* also refers to the the great Lord *Ādinārāyaṇa* who is a *Śeshī* for this endless *Śeshanāga*, whom the Lord has employed \(in his service\) as a couch, a seat, an adornment, the royal white umbrella, a jewel lamp and *Pādukā* \(Sandal\)

“नमोऽस्त्वनन्ताय सहस्रमूर्तये” As his \(i.e. *Śeshanāga’s*\) forms, qualities, powers and glories are all endless, this word \(*Ananta*\) befits him also.

“अनन्तवीर्यामृतविक्रमस्त्वम्”

“अनन्त”is the name in short of that *Nārāyaṇa* the Lord of Lords, who is called *Anantaśayana* as he has made *Anantanāga* his couch, and is also called *Anantapadmanābha,* as he has the navel which is the origin of *Brahma*.

There are three types among the idols of *Nārāyaṇa* who rests on *Anantanāga*. The first one is *Raṅganātha*. He has only two arms. He has no weapons in his hands. He has neither the lotus projecting out of his navel nor Lord *Brahma* on it. The Lord is in the posture of deep sleep placing one of this arms as a pillow. This idol can be seen in *ŚriRaṅgam, Śriraṅgapattaṇam. Śivanasamudra, Raṅgasthala* and some other places.

The second one is *Govindarāja*. He has four arms. He has *śankha*, *cakra* and *gadā* in three hands. The other arm is stretched \(forward\). He is in the posture of having eyes partially opened just after getting up from sleep. *Brahma* is seen sitting on the lotus flower. *Madhu* and *Kaiṭabha* are seen sitting at his lotus feet with folded hands. One can have the *darśan* of this *Govindarāja* in *Govindarājapattaṇa* which is at the foot of *Tirumala* \(*Tirupati*\), and in the *Sannidhi* opposite to that of Lord *Naṭarāja* of the *Cidambara* temple of *Cidambaram*, and in *Kalkunṭe* which is near *Chikkatirupati* \(which is\) near Bangalore.

The third is *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. He has two arms. Of them, the left arm is raised holding a downward faced lotus at the level of his neck. In the outstretched right lower arm, he appears to be covering a *śivaliṅga*. The Lord is shining in the posture of gracing the sages who are wishing him *Suprabhātam* with his broad eyes, just after waking up from *Yoganidrā*.

> योगनिद्रान्तविशदैः पावनैरवलोकनैः ।   
> भृग्वादीननुगृहणन्तं सौख्यशायिनिकानृषीन् ॥ 

The four faced *Brahma* is beaming in the *Padmāsana* posture in the lotus navel of the Lord. One can see this idol in *Tiruvanantapuram*. The *dhyānaśloka* is as follows:—

> श्रीकृष्णं क्षेत्रपालं ध्वजबलिसहितं भूतनाथं नृसिह्मम्   
> व्यासम् शम्भुं गणेशं रघुवरमनुजं जानकीं वायुपुत्रम् ।   
> विष्वक्सेनं सुपर्णं सुरमुनिकमलाभूमिब्रह्मादिसेव्यम्   
> वन्दे श्रीपद्मनाभं परमपदमहोपन्नगाभोगसुप्तम् ॥ 

I salute *Padmanābha* the Lord of the highest abode who is resting on *Anantaśeshanāga*, and who is being attended by *SrīKṛshṇa, Kshetrapālaka, Dhvajabali, Bhūtanātha, Śāstā, Yogānṛsimha, Vyāsa, Śiva, Gaṇeśa, ŚrīRāmaśītā Lakshmaṇa, Hanumanta Vishvaksena, Garuḍa, devatās, sages, ŚrīDevi, Bhūdevi* and *Brahmadeva*, *Sanakādisiddhas, Tumburu Nāradas, Saptarshis, Sūrya* and *Candra, Dikpālakas*, and *Jaya Vijayas*. As all these three are *Śeshanāga Anantamūrtis*, who among the three should be meditated upon and worshipped during *Anantana Vrata*? It is the third one i.e. *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*. \(*Ananta* is also the short form of *AnantaPadmanābhamūrti*\)

## When should this Anantana Vrata be celebrated?

This *Vrata* should be observed on the *caturdaśi* of *Bhādrapada śuddha*. This *vrata* should be observed even if *caturdaśī* prevails to the extent of just three *muhūrtas* at sunrise.

“उदये त्रिमुहूर्तापि ग्राह्यानन्तव्रते विधिः” “मध्याह्ने भोज्यवेलायाम्”

In all the *Vratas*, the *tithi* should extend till the afternoon.

A scholar by name *Divodāsa* says—

“पूजाव्रतेषु मध्याह्नव्यापिनी तिथिः”

If *caturdaśī* prevails atleast for one *muhūrthakāla* on *Bhādrapada pūrṇima*, it should be considered as *pūrṇa tithi* and *ŚrīVishṇu Pūja* should be performed—

“मुहूर्तमपि चेद्भाद्रे पूर्णिमायां चतुर्दशी । सम्पूर्णांतां विदुस्तस्यां पूजयेद्विष्णुमव्ययम्” \(*Skānda purāṇa*\)

The *Bhavishya Purāṇa* says:

> तथा भाद्रपदस्यान्ते चतुर्दश्यां द्विजोत्तम ।   
> पौर्णमास्याः समायोगे व्रतं चानन्तकं चरेत् ॥ 

“If *caturdaśī* is there at least for a duration of one *muhūrta, Ananta caturdaśī* should be celebrated on that day itself” says a treatise by name *Nirṇayāmṛta*. But, as per the axim “सन्दिग्धेष्वेकवाक्यत्वात्”, it is mandatory to observe *AnantaVrata* on *Caturdasī tithi* if it prevails either at the beginning or at the end of the afternoon. This is the conclusion stated in the treatise *Nirṇayasindhu*.

## How to celebrate the *Vrata*?

*Saṅkalpa* to perform this *vrata* should be done after bath and *ācamana*. And a *saṅkalpa* should be done for performing *YamunāPūja,* which is a part of the *Anantavrata*. \(This *yamunā pūja* should be performed by the side of a river, a lake or a pond or even near a well\)

> लोकपालस्तुतां देवीम् इन्द्रनीलसमप्रभाम् ।   
> यमुने त्वामहं ध्याये सर्वकामार्थसिद्धये ॥ 

> क्षीरोदार्णवसम्भूते क्षीरवर्णोपशोभिते ।   
> प्रसन्ना भव मे देवि यमुने ते नमो नमः ॥ 

And, as a part of the *Yamunāpūja*, the worship of \(the following viz\) *Tuṅga* who is *Sūryapādābjasambhūtā*, the dark hued *Kṛshṇaveṇi*, *Nandipādā, Bhīmarathī, Godāvari* river, deities and *Gaṅgadevī* should be performed. *Yamunādevī* should be worshipped with flowers. After the *Aṅgapūjā*, *nāmapūjā*, and *ashṭottaranāmapūjās* to *Yamunā* are performed, *uttarārādhana* should be done. All the services such as *Dhūpa, dīpa* etc should be offered. And river *Yamunā* should be praised \(with the sloka\):—

> विगाहे यामुनं तीर्थं साधु बृन्दावने स्थितम् ।   
> निरस्तजिह्मगस्पर्शे यत्र कृष्णः कृतादरः ॥ 

The worshipped *Kalaśa* which is filled with the water of *Yamunānadī—devī* who is the daughter of the Sun god, and sister of *Yamadharmarāja,* and who is dearest to *Padmanābha ŚrīKṛshṇa*, should be taken home along with *Maṅgalavādyas*. The *tīrtha* in the *Kalaśa* should to be added to the *Pūjākalaśa* of Lord *Ananta* and, on that \(*Kalaśa*\) the *darbha* knot, clothes, coconut and flowers should be arranged decoratively. That *darbha* knot should be in the shape of a seven hooded snake.

## Worship of *AnantaPadmanābha*

The number fouteen is a fixed number very dear to *AnantaPadmanābha*. The day of his *pūja* is the fourteenth day of *Śuklapaksha*. The number of knots in the thread in which is he invoked, should be fourteen etc. After invoking Lord *Ananta* in both the *Kalaśas*, the following should be done viz *saṅkalpa, Sarvopacārapūja Kalaśapūja, Praṇapratishṭhā, Dvārapālādiparivārapūjā, Dikpālaka pūjā, aṅga pūjā, pūjā* with leaves and flowers \(even red coloured flowers are best\), invoking *śesha* in fourteen darbha knots, *śeshapūja*, *Pūja* of fourteen *doragranthis*. and āvāhana. After *āvāhana*, these fourteen *granthi devatās* \(deities of knots\) viz., *Vishṇu, agni*, *Sūrya*, *Indra, Brahma, Vāyu, Śiva, Vighneśa, Skanda, Soma, Ākaśa, Varuṇa, Pṛthvi* and *Vasus* should be worshipped. And then *pūjā* should be done with *nāmāvalis* and *Ashṭtottara Śatanāmāvalis* addressing *Ananta*.

*AnantaPadmanābha* can be worshipped in a *kumbha* and also in a *manḍala*, an idol, or even in a picture. He can also be meditated upon and worshipped in the abovesaid form, as seen in *Tiruvanantapuram*. Or, he can be meditated upon and worshipped in the form, where he is seen resting on the seven hooded *Ādiśesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*, Four armed holding a lotus in his right hand and a conch in the lower right hand, a disc in the left hand and the mace in the lower left hand, and attended by *Śrī, Bhū* and *Nīlādevīs*, servants like *Garuḍa*, deities, sages like *Sanaka* and the seven sages such as *Bhṛgu* etc. The *dhyānaśloka* \(for that worship\) is as follows:

> कृत्वा दर्भमयं देवं वारांनिधिसमप्रभम् ।   
> फणसप्तान्विते सर्पे पिङ्गलाक्षं चतुर्भुजम् ॥ 

> दक्षिणाग्रकरे चक्रं गदां तस्याप्यधःकरे ।   
> शङ्खमूर्ध्वकरे वामे पद्मं तस्याप्यधःकरे ॥ 

> दधानं सर्वलोकेशं सर्वाभरणभूषितम् ।   
> दुग्धाब्धिमध्ये संस्थाप्य तत आवाहयेत् सुधीः ॥ 

The Lord is resting on a seven headed *Śesha* in *Kshīrasāgara*. He is dark complexioned, has four shoulders, holds five weapons such as *Śankha* and *cakra*. He is being served by *Garuḍa* and *Vishvaksena*, and is accompanied by *Śrī-Bhū-Nīlā Devīs*, and *Dvārapālakas*. He is worshipped by *Brahma, Indra* and other *devatās*. He is attended upon by *Siddhas* like *Sanaka* etc and seven sages like *Bhṛgu* etc. He holds a disc in the upper right hand and a mace in the lower one, a conch in the upper left hand and a lotus in the lower one. He should be offered *Shoḍaśopacāras* in detail. Also, pūja of fourteen *āvaraṇa devatās*, *pūja* with fourteen *patras* and fourteen *pushpas*, and *pūja* with fourteen *doragranthis* should be offered to him. Fourteen types of *bhakshyas* \(eatables\) should be offered to him. They are—

1. *puri unḍe* 
2. *pullangāyi unḍe* 
3. *Tuṇitenkoḷalu* 
4. *araḷunḍe*, 
5. *Cakkuli* 
6. *Thenkoḷalu*, 
7. *muccore*, 
8. *Kāyi obbattu* 
9. *Sajjappa*. 
10. *Āmbode*. 
11. *Kārāseve* 
12. *Kobbari Miṭhāyi* 
13. *Kadubu* 
14. *Atirasa* 
15. Butter \(mixed with saffron, Cardamon and sugar\) and, 
16. beaten rice mixed with jaggery. \(beaten rice should be prepared at home with purity\) 

Each one of these items should be prepared in twenty eight numbers and after offering them to God, fourteen from each of the items should be offered to *ṛthviks*. The rest fourteen should be retained as *prasāda*. And, the services viz *tambūla samarpaṇa*, *uttara nīrājana*, *arghya*, *pradakshiṇa* and *namaskāra* should be offered.

Then, new *doragrahaṇa* \(is done next\), reciting the *śloka*

> अनन्तकामदं देव सर्वपापप्रणाशन ।   
अनन्तदोररूपेण पुत्रपौत्रान्प्रवर्धय ॥   
> अनन्तसंसारमहासमुद्रे मग्नं समभ्युद्धर वासुदेव ।   
> अनन्तरूपिन् विनियोजयस्व ह्यनन्तसूत्राय नमो नमस्ते ॥ 

And saluting God, the *dora* should be tied to the right wrist. The following *śloka* is chanted during *dorabandhana*:

> संसारगह्व्रगुहासु सुखं विहर्तुं   
> वाञ्छन्ति ये कुरुकुलोद्भव शुद्धसत्त्वाः ।   
> सम्पूज्य च त्रिभुवनेशमनन्तदेवम्   
> बध्नन्ति दक्षिणकरे वरदोरकं ते ॥ 

The worn out old *dora* should be discarded chanting

> नमस्ते सर्वदेवाय विश्वरूपधराय च ।   
> सूत्रगन्थिषु संस्थाय अनन्ताय नमो नमः ॥ 

The last part of the *Vrata* is *upāyana dāna*. \(The *Kalaśa* of *Āvāhana*, *vastra*, *dakshiṇā* and half of the *naivedya* offered to God should given as *dāna* to *srotriyas*\)

> गृहाणेदं द्विजश्रेष्ठ वायनं दक्षिणायुतम् ।   
> त्वत्प्रसादात् व्रती देव मुच्यते कर्मबन्धनात् ॥   
> अनन्तः प्रतिगृणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> अनन्तस्तारकोभाभ्यां अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The hymn *“Devasyatvā”* should be chanted while offering the *dāna,* and also during the *Pratigraha*. *Pūjā* should be performed again. And *Anusandhāna* should to be done with the wish that Lord *Anantapadmanābha* may become pleased, graceful and may grant boons.

“अनया पूजया भगवान् सर्वात्मकः अनन्तपद्मनाभः सुप्रीतः सुप्रसन्नो वरदो भवतु”

The story of *AnantaVrata* should be listened to, after the worship.

An important point to be taken note of regarding *Ananta Vrata* is that the number fourteen is significant in this *Vrata*. The day of his *vrata* is *Caturdaśī*. The number of knots in the threads that are tied to the hand in his worship is fourteen. The number of deities in the *Āvaraṇapūja* is fourteen. The number of leaves, flowers and items for *Naivedya* are all fourteen. *Udyāpana* is also after fourteen years. This unique number is symbolic of the fact that the entire universe consisting of the fourteen worlds is under his unabridged reign. *Ādiśesha* who happens to be his couch is *Ananta*. He \(i.e. *Ādiśesha*\) is adored with infinite qualities and endowed with endless power and is totally *Śeshabhūta* to *Anantapadmanābha*. Remaining in close proximity to him, he happens to be the foremost recipient of his *Śeshaprasāda*.

***“Garuḍa* and serpants are enemies by birth. But in the vicinity of *Ananthapadmanābha,* both are friendly and are completely at his service. *Garuḍa* is not gandering at his wings and *Śeshanāga* is not worried about his hoods. Because, the gazes of both of them are fixed at *Nārāyaṇa* who is the eternally blissful Lord.”—These were the words of *Śrī Gurudeva* pertaining to this.** *Kālidāsa* also describes this as “मुक्तशेषविरोधेन”. \(“The one who has not an iota of enemity with *Ādiśesha*”\) *Nāgasarpas* are of different colours and kinds. But this *Nāgarāja Ādiśesha* is pure white in complexion, as described by the *aḷvārs* who were greatest devotees. “Vellattaravil tuyil amarndavittinai”. He is of pure bright white colors is of pure bright white colors is full of pure *Sattvaguṇa*, and not a smidgen of *rajas* and *tamas* is found in him. This *Anantanāgarāja* has one thousand hoods.

The *purāṇas* say that this entire earth is perched on one of his thousand hoods, like a mustard grain. In the images and pictures in temples, he is seen with five or seven hoods. Which is this strange \(imaginary\) serpent?

One may say no such snake carrying the earth is seen around. Yes, it is not the physical serpent. This *Śeshasarpa* is the very *Kunḍalinī Śakti* which is described in *Yogaśastra* and visualized by *jnānis*. As it has countless *Vrttis*, it is called as a thousand hooded serpent, say the *jnānis.* The *jnānis* who witness it say that the *Prāṇaśakti* \(*Kunḍalini*\) in our *pinda* \(body\) which has five *vṛttis* such as *prāṇa, Apāna* etc. or seven *Vṛttis,* is itself *Ādiśesha* as expressed in “सप्तप्राणाः प्रभवन्ति”. That is why the *Ādiśesha* who is both the couch and umbrella etc to the Lord, is shown as a five hooded or a seven hooded serpent. One can see this *Śeshanāga* whom the *yogis* who are *jnānis* have seen with the *Jnanadṛshṭi* and described, only after obtaining the inner eye.

*Yogis* see this *AnantaPadmanābha* who rests on this *Anantanāga*. We wish that the external worship offered to Lord *Padmanābha* helps us to obtain the *Yogadṛshṭi* and *Jnānadrshṭi* which are needed for that.

We noted that as per precepts, fourteen pairs of *Bhakshaṇas* should to be prepared and offered as *Naivedya* in the worship of *Ananta*. What should one do if he cannot afford to prepare so many *Bhakshaṇas*? It will be O.K. even if one item among them viz. *Sajjappa* is prepared and offered. God will be pleased even if fruits are offered. Those who can afford, many prepare all of them in fourteen numbers which is a mystrical, significant number and offer them for the awakening of the spiritual centres, and for bliss.

It is prescribed that at the end of the *Pūjā*, half of the things used for the worship of God viz the pot, the idol, clothes and the *Bhakshaṇa* and *Naivedya* etc., should be gifted to *Srotriyas*.

But, eligible recepients who are austere, do not \(generally\) receive \(any gifts\) from others. In such a case, without finding out whether a person is *satpātra* or *apātra*, can those things be gifted as *dāna* to anyone that comes by at that moment?

No. A *dāna* should be given to *satpātras* only. *Dāna* should be made after meditating upon God and with the sentimental feeling that all the items of gift are *Brahmasvarūpas*. The *dāni* also should receive it with the same *Brahambhāva*. Divine observances should be completed without any blemish touching anyone on both the sides. It is for this very reason, the following *sloka*, the purport of which is, “everything is *Anantapadmanābha Svarūpam”* should be chanted and reflected upon.

> अनन्तः प्रतिगृहणाति अनन्तो वै ददाति च ।   
> द्वयोश्च तारकोऽनन्तः अनन्ताय नमो नमः॥ 

The person who receives the *dāna* is also *Ananta*, the person who gives it is also *Ananta* and the divine force that helps the two to attain salvation is also *Ananta*. We salute Lord *Ananta* again and again.
