Even though born of a low caste, Akṣamālā, the wife of Vaśiṣṭha, became,
through that union, ‘*worthy of worship*’.

Similarly the ‘*doe*’ though an animal, on becoming united with the sage
Mandapāla, ‘*became worthy of worship*.’

Thus it is that even low-born women, belonging to the lower castes, came
to be honoured like their husbands; as it has been said that ‘women are
honoured by their age’.—(23).
