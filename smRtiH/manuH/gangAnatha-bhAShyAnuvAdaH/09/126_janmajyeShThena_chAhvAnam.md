This is a declamatory text, supporting the view that seniority is to be
determined by birth.

The ‘*Subrahmaṇyā*’ is the name of a *mantra*—text recited by the
*Chandogas* at the *Jyotiṣṭoma* sacrifice,—occurring in the *Aitareya
Brāhmaṇa* (63). The plural number in ‘*Subrahmaṇyāsu*’ is due to the
multiplicity of verses.

In connection with this mantra, the ‘eldest son’ addresses the
invocation to the father—‘Devadatta’s father offers the sacrifice.’
(Where it is the eldest brother who names himself).

Thus it is ‘seniority’ by birth that is *real* ‘seniority’ in the true
sense; the ‘seniority’ based upon the position of the mother is only
secondary, figurative.

‘*Between* *sons* *conceiced as twins*,’—those that have been
simultaneously conceived—seniority is determined by birth.—(126)
