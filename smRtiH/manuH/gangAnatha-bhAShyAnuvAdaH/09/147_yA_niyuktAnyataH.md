Before ‘*niyuktā*,’ there should be an ‘*a*’ (coalescing with the ‘*ā*’
in ‘*yā*’); for otherwise (if the word meant ‘authorised’) the present
verse would be contrary to what has gone in the preceding verse. It
might be argued that with ‘*aniyuktā*,’^(‘)not authorised,’ this would
be a needless repetition of what has gone before. But such superfluity
can be, and has been, explained.

The older writers however do not accept the reading ‘*aniyuktā*,’ ‘not
authorised.’ And according to them the text is to be explained as
meaning that ‘the son born of the *authorised* woman also is not
entitled to the paternal property.’

‘*Last-born*,’— even when the man acts under ‘authority,’ there is
always a certain amount of ‘*lust*’ involved, hence the child is called
‘lust-born.’

‘*Born in vain*;’—this means that he is incapable of accomplishing the
purpose for which he was begotten.

This verse turns out (according to the older writers) to be a denial of
the title to inheritance declared before (in 147); and hence an option
has been accepted in this case,

Our revered teacher however declares that if we read ‘*aniyuktā*,’ ‘not
authorised,’ the two texts become reconciled.—(147)
