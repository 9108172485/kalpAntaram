‘*The woman is the mainspring*’— the prime cause of the begetting of
children and the rest.

That this is so is quite ‘*clear*.’

‘*Ordinary life of the world*,’—such as offering food to guests that
have arrived, welcoming and inviting others, and so forth.

‘*Of each of these things*’—the woman is the mainspring. Another reading
for ‘*pratyartham*’ (‘*of each of these*’) is ‘*pratyaham*’ (daily)

The term ‘*clearly*’ implies *importance*, the sense being that the
woman is the *prime* cause.—(27)
