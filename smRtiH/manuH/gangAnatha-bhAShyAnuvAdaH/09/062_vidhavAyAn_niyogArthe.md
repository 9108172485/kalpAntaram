The ‘authorisation’ herein laid down refers to the act of ‘intercourse’,
ending with the sexual act. After this act has been accomplished, their
behaviour towards each other should be like that of the ‘elder’ and the
‘daughter-in-law’. If the woman is the wife of the elder brother, she
shall be treated like an ‘elder’; but if she is the wife of the younger
brother, she shall be treated like a ‘daughter-in-law

The use of the term ‘*towards each other*’ implies that the woman should
behave like the daughter-in-law towards her elder brother-in-law, and
like an ‘elder’ towards her younger brother-in-law.—(62)
