‘*Malevolent rite*,’— encompassing death by such superphysical means as
incantations and the like. If anyone performs such a rite, he shall
receive the prescribed punishment, if the person aimed at does not die
off. But in the case of such rites being successful, the man cannot
escape with such a simple punishment. In that case the penalty shall be
the same as that for ‘man-slaughter.’

The term ‘*all*’ is meant to imply that the same punishment is to be
inflicted in the case of *Vedic* as well as *non-Vedic* rites;—*Śyena*
and other sacrifies being the ‘*Vedic* malevolent rites,’ and the
‘taking of the foot-dust’, ‘pricking with a needle’ the *non-Vedic*
ones.

‘*Magic spells*’— such as ‘bringing under control’ and so forth.

‘*Persons related*’ are the son, the wife and such relations of the
victim; other than these are the ‘*presons* *not related*.’

‘*Sorcery*’ also is only a form of ‘malevolent rite,’ consisting of
‘expulsion’ and such ends as ‘bringing about feelings of disgust against
friends and relations,’ ‘insanity’ and other similar magical effects
brought about by means of incantations.—(290)
