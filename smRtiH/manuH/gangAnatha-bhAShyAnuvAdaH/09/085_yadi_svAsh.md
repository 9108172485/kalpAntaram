If urged by carnal desire, men should wed women belonging to the same
caste as themselves, or those belonging to other castes, then their
‘*seniority*’ shall depend upon ‘*the order of their castes*,’— and not
upon age, nor upon the order of their age.

‘*Honour*’—consisting in the presenting of fruits and other things.

‘*The order of the caste*’ is that the Brāhmaṇa-wife comes first, then
the *Kṣatriya*, then the *Vaiśya*.

‘*Habitation*’—*i.e*., the principal apartments. This belongs to the
Brāhmaṇa-wife.

Among wives of the same caste, all this is governed by the order of
their marriage.—(85)
