‘*Learning*’—teaching, *etc*., as also proficiency in an art.

‘*Friendly presents*’—Presents received from friends.

‘*Marriage—presents*’—in the shape of dowry and the like.

‘*In connection with the honey-mixture*’—*i.e*., in consideration of
priestly functions. Though this also is a ‘gain of learning,’ yet it has
been mentioned separately, because it is obtained by means of the
special kind of work of officiating at sacrifices.

‘*Marriage*—*presents*’—stand for all that is received from the
father-in-law’s house. Others explain it to mean any presents that are
made to one in connection with his marriage.—(206)
