Those officers who have been ‘*deputed*’—appointed—‘*to look after the
business*’— investigation of eases and so forth—‘*of suitors*’,—as
representatives of the King;—if these, ‘*fired by the heat of
wealth*’—*i.e*. having received bribes from either party—‘*hamper that
business*’,—‘*these the king shall render penniless*’,—*i.e*. he shall
confiscate all their property.

Though for the delinquency of officers a distinct punishment is going to
be prescribed (in 234), yet what is here laid down refers to the case of
repeated offences.

Other officers also—such as the commander of an army and the like—when
ordered against a certain party, take bribes from him, and do not
proceed to capture him;—these also shall be met with the same
punishment.

Others read ‘*aniyukta*’ (for ‘niyukta’); and in that case the meaning
is—‘If some persons though not appointed to any office, proceed to help
one or the other party,—either on account of their considering
themselves the king’s favourites, or of their being very rich,—and thus
prevent justice bring done to the other party,—they shall be punished as
here prescribed.’

In this case, the epithet ‘*fired by the heat of wealth*’ (*i*. *e*.,
bribed) would not have any significance; *not* ‘*appointed*’ being the
most significant qualification in this case.—(231)
