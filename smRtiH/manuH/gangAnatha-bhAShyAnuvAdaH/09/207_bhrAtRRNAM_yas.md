When several brothers are living together, and jointly manage their
ancestral properly by cultivation and other means, if any one of them
does not help in the management,—it is the debarring of such a brother
that is declared here.

‘*He shall* *be debarred*’— set aside—‘*from his share*’ in the nett
profits of the estate. These profits shall not he given to the said
brother; he however is not to be debarred from the main ancestral
estate. But the profits also shall not be wholly taken away from him; a
part of his share of the profits shall be taken by the others, in
exchange for their own labour, and the remainder shall he given to him
‘by *way of maintenance*.’

Or ‘*nirbhājyaḥ*’ may mean ‘shall he separated,’ ‘not allowed to live
jointly.’ Because, it is just possible that after some time ho may
acquire more property and become entitled to an equal share (?) In such
a case what the allotment of shares shall be has been indicated by
Nārada, whose declaration shows that the man is to have a larger share
in the property named, and only a small share in what is not. so named.
