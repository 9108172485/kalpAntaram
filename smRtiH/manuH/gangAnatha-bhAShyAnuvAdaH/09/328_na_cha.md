“Why should there be any question of *willing* regarding what forms a
means of livelihood? It has been already pointed out that, even though
there is a transcendental factor in the matter, yet stress is laid upon
only the visible aspect; just as in the case of the rule regarding
*facing the East* during meals. It is in view of this that the text
says—‘*The Vaiśya shall never conceive the wish*.’ So that if the Vaiśya
is not in want of a livelihood, he shall not incur any sin (in being
unwilling to tend cattle.)”

True; but the author has used the particular words with a view to show
that the duty of tending of cattle does not stand on the same
footing—and is to be regarded as leading to the same results—as that of
‘cultivating the land,’ along with which ‘cattle-tending’ has been
mentioned before; and hence men may be led to regard all of them as
leading to the same results. And according to the view that they are all
conducive to the same results, ‘wish’ also would come in as a
determining factor; specially when the man is one who may be hankering
after other actions. In a ease where ‘cattle-tending’ is the most
profitable means of livelihood, the man would naturally have recourse to
it, and not engage in other kinds of work; he would naturally live by
the said means of livelihood. (?)—(328)
