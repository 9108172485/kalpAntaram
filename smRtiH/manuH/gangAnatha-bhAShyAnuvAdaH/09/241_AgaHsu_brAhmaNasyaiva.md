The condition of expiatory penances being performed does not apply to
what is asserted here.

In the case of all these offences—of Brāhmaṇa-slaughter and the rest—the
Brāhmaṇa shall be fined ‘the middle-most amercement’

The qualification ‘*unintentionally*’ of the next verse has to be
construed with this also.

After he has paid the fine, he should be made to perform the expiatory
penances.

‘*Along with his goods and chattels*.’—This is a special favour to be
granted in the case of highly qualified Brāhmaṇas.

In the case of the offence being *unintentional*, he may not be
banished.—(241)
