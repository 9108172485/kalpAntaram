In course of the enunciation of the ‘heads of dispute’, after ‘adultery’
comes ‘the determining of the duties of husband and wife’, it is this
therefore that is now going to be set forth.

When the husband is very much harassed by his wife, or the wife is very
much persecuted by her husband, the dispute is to be brought up before
the king.

It has been laid down that the wife shall attend upon her husband who
behaves in the right manner, who is not beset with hate and jealousy and
who is well-disposed towards his wife; and the husband has no sort of
‘sovereignty’ over his wife; and the (attending) is to consist in
shampooing his feet and rendering such service as behoves a servant

Though the words used in the text are ‘man’ and ‘woman—which only denote
the human genus in its two sexes,—yet in the present context they are
relative terms, connotative of the *husband* and *wife*; specially as in
the next verse, the term ‘*sva*’ (*svaiḥ*) clearly indicates that the
‘man’ and ‘woman’ bear a distinct relationship to one another.

The present verse contains the author’s declaration as to what he is
going to do in the coming discourse.

Of the husband and wife ,—‘*during union*’—while they are together,—and
‘*during separation*’,—when the husband has gone away from home.

‘*The righteous path*’— regarding toilet, the care of the body and so
forth.

All this ‘*I am going to expound*’.

The epithet ‘*eternal*’ is only by way of praise.

‘*Who keep to the righteous path*—this is purely reiterative of the fact
that it is the path laid down in the legal scriptures that is the most
righteous.—(1).
