‘*Disquisitions*’—the setting forth of a matter for investigation; or a
dissertation.—‘*Listen*’ to that,—‘*set forth*’—put forward—‘*regarding
the son*’—with reference to the son,—‘*by the wise patriarchs and the
great sages*’

‘*Salutary to the world*’—calculated to do good to all men.

‘*Propitious*’—beneficial.

The subject of the ‘laws relating to children,’ which was introduced in
verse 25 has been interrupted by the few verses dealing with the
greatness of women; hence it has been necessary to recall attention to
the original subject-matter—‘*listen to the disquisition*’.—(31)
