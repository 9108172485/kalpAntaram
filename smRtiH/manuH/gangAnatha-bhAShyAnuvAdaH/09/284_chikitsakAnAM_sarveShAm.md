‘*Physicians*’— doctors.

‘*Dealing dishonestly*.’—The prescribing of medicines by dishonest
practitioners may be done in two ways—(1) it may be due to the man being
devoid of theoretical and practical knowledge entirely, or (2) to
negligence or greed, even though the knowledge of the science is there.

‘*In the case of patients other than human*’—*i.e*., cows, horses,
elephants, and so forth.

‘*The first*’—the term ‘amercement’ has to be construed here.

Similarly in the case of human patients, the ‘*middlemost amercement*.’

But if on account of the dishonest dealing, the patient happen to die,
then severe punishment shall be inflicted.—(284)
