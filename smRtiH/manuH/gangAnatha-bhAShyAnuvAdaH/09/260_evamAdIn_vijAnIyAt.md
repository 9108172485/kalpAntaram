‘*Others of the same kind*’— It is not possible to enumerate each and
every kind of rogue addicted to robbing other persons; hence this
phrase;—*e.g*., there is one class of men who come and tell a man who is
stricken with a certain woman that she is in love with him, though in
reality she hates him; and another who, though not a servant, behaves as
if he were one, and thus robs a simple-minded man of his gold; others
again who flatter the foolish rich with such words as ‘you are Brahmā,’
‘you are Bṛhaspati’ and cheat them out of their riches; telling him —‘
kindly give me such and such a thing, I shall repay it in a few days’;
and as soon as their business is accomplished, they become scarce, and
hitherto smooth-tongued, become harsh.—(260)
