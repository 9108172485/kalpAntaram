It has been declared ‘that consummation of it is to be understood as
occurring at the seventh step’
[(8.227)](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201157.html).
People may be inclined to the notion that if the bridegroom dies before
this point has been reached, the girl may be given away to another man;
it is this notion that the present text, precludes.

This prohibition has been repeated here, in view of the special
circumstances herein mentioned; as a matter of fact, the girl married
after betrothal has been already declared to be a ‘remarried widow.’

When the girl has been betrothed, given away, to one man,—if he happens
to die—she shall not be given to another. By doing this the father
incurs the guilt of ‘*fraud towards men*’; —*i.e*., he incurs the same
guilt that would be incurred by the kidnapping of a human being.—(71)
