‘*All these*’—Eunuchs and the rest.

‘*At all*’—throughout life.

‘*Food and clothing*’—being necessary for the keeping of the body; it is
implied that he should provide enough to enable them to engage the
necessary servants and other attendants; specially because in the case
of the blind and the rest, living would be impossible without a servant.
Those again for whom marriage is permitted, the provision made should
include that for their wives also.

‘*To the best of* *his* *ability*’—the food and clothing provided shall
be in accordance with the man’s own wealth.

‘*Outcast*’—this is purely declamatory.—(202)
