‘*From water*’—*i.e*., from herbs anil trees—springs fire; that is why
it is named ‘*agni*.’ *The* ‘*all-penetrating force*’ of this is that
which burns all that can be burnt; and yet when it reaches water, it
becomes extinguished.

‘*From stone spiring iron*’—in the shape of the sword and other weapons.
It tears everything; and yet when it falls on stone it breaks and
becomes blunted.

Similarly *Kṣatriyas* conquer everywhere; but when they behave
arrogantly towards the *Brāhmaṇa*, they are ruined.
