‘*Out of ten*’— animals.

‘The additional share,’ mentioned in the preceding verses,—there is to
be none,—when the brothers are all ‘*efficient*’—particularly
excellent—‘*in their occupations*’—of learning, study and so forth.

Some people take the term ‘*daśasu*,’ ‘out of ten,’ as purely
illustrative;—the sense being that there is to be none of the additional
shares that are mentioned in the text which speaks of ‘the best of ten;’
and the reason given for this explanation is that the text lays down
‘efficiency in occupations’ as the ground.

Even in such cases however, the other brothers should give to the eldest
brother ‘*some little thing*’—some present—as a mark of respect.—(115)
