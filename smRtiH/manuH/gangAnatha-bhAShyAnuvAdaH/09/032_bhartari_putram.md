‘*Husband*’—the marrier; the man with whom the woman has gone through
the sacrament of marriage; and when a son is born from this husband in
that women, ‘*they*’—all learned men—‘*recognise*’—accept—the son to be
that man’s. There is no difference of opinion on this point; it is an
acknowledged principle.

‘*There is diversity of opinion however in regard to* one *who is the
progenitor only*’; in a case where the man is not one to whom the woman
has been married, but only the begetter of the son in a soil belonging
to another man.

This diversity of opinion is next pointed out—‘*Some people declare the
begetter*’ to be the person to whom the child belongs; while others
declare ‘*the* *owner* *of the soil*’ to be so; *i.e*., the person whose
wife the woman is, even though he be not the actual begetter.

Having thus propounded the doubt due to the difference of opinion among
teachers, the author himself proceeds to justify the doubt.—(32)
