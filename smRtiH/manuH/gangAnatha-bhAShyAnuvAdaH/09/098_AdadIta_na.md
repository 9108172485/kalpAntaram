What is to be done when the fee is received voluntarily, has been laid
down in the preceding verse. Hence some people might come to entertain
the following notion—“There is nothing wrong in receiving the nuptial
fee, since the scriptures have laid down special rules regarding the
subject.” And with a view to preclude such a notion, the text
says—‘*even a Śūdra should not take a nuptial fee*.’—What the foregoing
text has done is to lay down certain rules relating to cases where a man
receives the fee, of his own will; and it does not lay down the
propriety of receiving the fee. Just as the laying down of expiatory
rites in connection with wine-drinking does not mean that the drinking
is permitted.

The ‘nuptial fee’ here spoken of is the same as what has been deprecated
in another text; and we have already explained why the same fact has
been reiterated in the present verse.’—(98)
