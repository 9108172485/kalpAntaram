‘*Commonpractice*’— ordinary usage; what has been stated here is the
‘common practice’ obtaining in the world; and when it is said that
‘women are to be guarded in such and such a manner, and not otherwise’,

‘*Now listen to the laws relating to children*’;—*i.e*., to whom does
the child belong?—to the owner of the seed, or to the owner of the
field?

‘*Udarka*’ stands for ‘*futurity*’; and that whose ‘*future is happy’
is* called ‘*sukhodarka*’, *conducive to happiness*. The praise is that
while all things perish in the end, these do not perish.—(25)
