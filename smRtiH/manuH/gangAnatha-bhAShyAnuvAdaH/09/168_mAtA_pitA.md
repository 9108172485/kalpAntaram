It would be more reasonable to read ‘*ca*’ ‘and,’ instead of ‘*vā*,’
‘or’—‘The father *and* the mother’; the child belongs to both the
parents, and cannot be given away, if either of them is unwilling.

Or, we may accept the reading ‘*vā*’ ‘or’; according to another text,
which says—‘The father or the mother may give the child’; but when the
father is spoken of as the *superior* of the two parents, this
*superiority* pertains to other matters.

“Since there is the mother’s ownership also over the child, the father
cannot have the sole right to give away the son.”

True; but there are texts declaring that in the absence of the parents
(?) the child belongs to the owner of the seed. It is for this reason
that the ‘father’ has been mentioned. Vaśiṣṭha also has declared—“The
woman shall neither give away nor adopt a son.’

‘*Worthy*’;—this refers, not to *caste*, but to the presence of
qualifications in conformity with the family concerned. Thus, it is that
the Brāhmaṇa can adopt sons of the *Kṣatriya* and other castes also.

‘*Affectionately*.’—This has been added with a view to preclude *greed*
and such motives for the giving away of the child.—(168)
