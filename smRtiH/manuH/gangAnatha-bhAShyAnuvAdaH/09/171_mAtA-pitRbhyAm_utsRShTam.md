A child may be deserted by the parents, either because they have many
children whom they are unable to support by reason of poverty, or
because the particular child has some such defect as disaffection
towards his parents and the like.

But the child should not have been openly deserted; as in that case it
would not be entitled to being received as a son,—as has been shown
elsewhere.

This desertion may be by either one of the parents.

‘*Takes up*’—with a view to making him his son,—and not to only
supporting him.—(171)
