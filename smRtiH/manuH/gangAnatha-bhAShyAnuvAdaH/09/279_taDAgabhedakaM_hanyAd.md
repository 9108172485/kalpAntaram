‘*Tank*’—has been mentioned only by way of an illustration.

The same thing applies to the ‘stealing’ of the water of a river
also;—say some people.

This however is not right; because the harm done in the breaking of the
tank is very great; and it is only slight in the case of the breaking of
a river-dam.

The law here laid down applies also to the case of cutting the
embankments of a tank.—(279)
