All that is meant by the injunction here put forth is that whenever a
man goes abroad, he should do so after having made provision for his
wife’s subsistence; the form of the injunction being—‘one going abroad
should make provision for the subsistence of his wife’; that is, he
should so arrange it that during the time that he is away, she shall be
supplied with means of sustaining her body, with food, clothing and
other household requisites.

Having provided for all this, he shall^(‘)*go abroad*,’ *i.e*., go away
to foreign lands.

‘*Having business*.’—‘*Business*’ stands for the man’s purpose, visible
(temporal) as well as invisible (spritual); the latter consisting in
‘merit’ and the former in ‘wealth’ and ‘pleasure.’ This same idea is
going to be set forth again (in 76)—‘If the man has gone abroad for the
purposes of merit, etc.’

This text forbids journeying abroad and leaving the wife behind, in the
absence of some such purpose as those herein mentioned.

‘*Distressed by want of* *subsistence*.’—This points out a visible harm
likely to arise; and is a purely declamatory assertion.
‘*Distressed*’—troubled—‘*by want of subsistence*’— by poverty.

‘*May* *become corrupt*’—by intercourse with other men.

‘*Even though virtuous*.’—‘*Virtue*’ stands for the customs and ways of
the family; and she who keeps up these is ‘*virtuous*.’

It is quite likely that through hunger and other forms of privation, the
distressed wife may fall into corruption, and maintain herself by
betaking herself to another ‘husband.’ The affix in ‘*praduṣyet*’
indicates likelihood—(74)
