‘*Treasury*’—the place where the king’s riches are stored; those who rob
this are to be put to death, irrespectively of the quality or quantity
of the property stolen.

Those also who behave disaffectedly towards him;—for instance, those who
obstruct the king’s attempts to import such rare foreign articles, as
the coal-black horse which is rare for Easterners, or the elephant,
which is rare for the Northerners,—or try to turn his friends into
enemies, and try to bring about an alliance of these with his
enemies,—and thus ‘*conspire with his enemies*’— and egg them on;—these
he shall put to death.

It has been already explained that since the penalty is meant for the
accomplishment of a definite purpose of the King, it need not always be
actual *death*.—(275)
