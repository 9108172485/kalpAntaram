Women should not be left free to act as they like, in regard to
morality, wealth and pleasure. Whenever they desire to employ their
wealth in acts of righteousness and the like, they should obtain the
permission of their ‘*men*’, the husband or other male relations,
according to her age.

‘*Their men*’—Guardians, indicated in the following verse.

‘*Sensual objects*’—Singing and the like; they become ‘*addicted to*’
having recourse to—these,—‘*they should be kept under one’s
control*,’—should be cheeked.

Though the phrase ‘*not left to themselves*’ indicates the propriety of
depriving them of independence in regard to all actions, yet the text
specifically mentions the ‘sensual objects’ with a view to point out
that in regard to latter special care should be taken; so that people
may not be led to think that all that is necessary is to prevent the
women from associating with other men, and it does not matter if they
become addicted to drink and other evils, while keeping confined to
their homes.

The particle ‘*ca*’ indicates that, though what the words directly
declare is the duty of the man, yet it also follows that the woman also
should not be independent; it is in this manner that the duties of both
‘man and woman’ in relation to one another become expounded, as promised
in verse (1),—and not those duties that consist of sacrificial
performances and the like.—(2).
