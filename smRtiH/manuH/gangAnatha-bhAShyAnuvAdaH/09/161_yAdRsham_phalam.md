The ‘*Kṣetraja*’ and other sons having been mentioned along with the
‘legitimate’ son, people might think that all of them stand on the same
footing; it is with a view to set aside this notion that the author adds
this verse. The sense is that the ‘Kṣetraja’ and other ‘bad sons’ are
not capable of rendering the same assistance that is rendered by the
‘legitimate’ son.

Even though the text does not mention anything definite, yet people have
explained it to mean this, on the basis of the context. Others, however,
have explained the ‘bad sons’ to mean ‘sons of unauthorised women.’

The sense is that even though people have these ‘had sons,’ they should
not regard themselves as having sons, they should still continue to make
efforts to obtain a ‘legitimate’ son.

‘*Gloom*’—of the other world, due to the man’s past misdeeds, in the
shape of not having paid off the debts to his *Pitṛs*,—which could be
cleared off only by moans begetting offspring.—(161)
