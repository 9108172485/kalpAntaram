The sin incurred by the king in punishing the innocent is equal to that
incurred in acquitting the guilty,—in connection with the
above-mentioned crimes.

The king receives taxes for fulfilling certain duties; if he fails to do
these, he incurs sin; but the due fulfilment of these does not
necessarily involve spiritual merit As for the declaration —‘*merit
accrues to him, if he chastises justly*’,—which speaks of merit
accruing—all this is merely commendatory of the injunction regarding the
fulfilment of one’s duties.

The teaching regarding ‘punishments’ is for the purpose of preventing
crime; hence they shall be inflicted, according to law, by various
methods of corporal punishment The declarations made in this connection
pertain to the accomplishment of all such kingly duties as are conducive
to temporal ends; *e.g*. the punishing of the ‘haughty’, the ‘warlike’
and so forth. And as the teaching pertains to visible ends, it is not
the actual *death-penalty* that shall be inflicted in all cases. Hence
if the intended chastisement is secured by other means, there would be
nothing wrong in this.—(249)
