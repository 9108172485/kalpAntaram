‘*Others*’—*the Kṣatriyas* and other castes,—when they have committed
‘*these offences*’—the most heinous crimes,—‘*unintentionally*’— without
actually wishing it,—should have all their property confiscated.

Some people hold that this is another punishment laid down for those who
have performed the expiatory penances,—alternative to the. one
prescribed in the foregoing verse.

In the case of these crimes being committed ‘*intentionally*,’ death has
been prescribed as the penalty.

In the case of the *Śūdra*, if the crime has been committed
intentionally, there is to be ‘branding’ and ‘confiscation of the whole
property’; and if it has been done intentionally, he shall be put to
death.—(242)
