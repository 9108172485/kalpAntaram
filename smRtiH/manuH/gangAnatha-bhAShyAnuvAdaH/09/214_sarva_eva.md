‘*Addicted to evil deeds*’— doing such acts as are forbidden.

When all the brothers are working for the benefit of the whole family,
if the eldest brother surreptitiously takes possession of and invests
the property, under the impression that he would show them the
‘principal’ if they ask for it,—then he should he made to hand over to
all the brothers, the principal along with the interest that may have
accrued to it. But if at the very outset, he lays the whole property
before his brothers and says openly—‘Here is the property, each of you
take your share, I shall separate mine and earn interest on it,’—then
they are not entitled to the interest thus earnad; which belongs
exclusively to the eldest brother, and forms his ‘special hoard.’—(214)
