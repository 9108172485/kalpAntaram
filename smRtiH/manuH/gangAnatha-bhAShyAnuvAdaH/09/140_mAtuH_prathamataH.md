It has been declared (132) that ‘he shall offer the cake to his father
and *to his maternal grandfather*’; where the offering of the cake by
the son of the Appointed Daughter to bis maternal grandfather has been
enjoined; and this is a totally different kind of offering laid down for
him.

‘*The first cake, he shall offer to his mother*,’—the second to her
father.

Some people read ‘*pitustasya*,’ ‘*his* (not *her*) *father*’ And those
who accept this reading offer the cake to the Appointed Daughter, and
then to the *progenitor*, and then the third to the progenitor’s father.

In accordance with this view there would be no offering laid down for
the maternal grandfather.—(140)
