When a *Kṣatriya* tries to injure a Brāhmaṇa, ho shall be restrained by
the *Brāhmaṇas* themselves. Being puffed up through wealth-born
arrogance, when *Kṣatriyas* are apt to overstep all bounds of propriety,
they are brought back to the right path by *Brāhmaṇas*, through prayers,
offerings and curses.

The reason is—‘*Because the Kṣatriya has his source in the Brāhmaṇa*.’
The *Kṣatriyas* were born from the *Brāhmaṇa* caste.

The question arising—“How can one who is the source of another become
his destroyer?”—the answer is supplied by the next verse.—(320)
