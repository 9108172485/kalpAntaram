‘*According to rule*’—in accordance with the rules laid down in the
scriptures.

‘*Has espoused her*’—This would be ‘espousal’ or ‘marriage’ only in
name; as the maiden in such a case would he called a ‘*punarbhū*,’ ‘a
remarried widow’; and even though married, she could not be a ‘wife’ (in
the real sense of the term); her marriage, which is nominal, being only
for a defenite purpose. That this is so is shown in the next
verse—‘Having given away his daughter to one man, one shall not give her
to another,’—which means, that she should not be given to her younger
brother-in-law either; and when she is not *given away*—and as such does
not become the property of the man—how could she he his ‘wife’?

‘*Clad in white garments*’;—this is a rule that is to be observed by the
man approaching the woman; it is to be observed also in other cases of
‘authorisation.’—(70)
