The King shall always keep himself informed of his own and his enemy’s
strength. He should find out.—‘What does he intend to do?’—‘What is he
able to do against me?’—‘What am I able to do against him?’

“How is all this to be ascertained?”

(*a*) ‘*Through spies*’—as described under Discourse VII;—(*b*)
‘*Through display of energy*’— when a King rewards men they are happy
and become imbued with energy, and carrying on their agricultural
operations successfully, reap rich harvests \[and this shows the King’s
power\].—(*c*) ^(‘)*Through the actual carrying out of
undertakings*;’—such undertakings as the disposition of armies and so
forth, which are indicative of the enemy’s strength; as all these are
signs of material prosperity, and from this is all strength
derived.—(298)
