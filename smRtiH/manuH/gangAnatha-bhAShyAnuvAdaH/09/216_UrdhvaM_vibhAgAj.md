After the partition has been made,—in which the father has taken two
shares—if a son happens to be born, he shall receive these two shares,
during the father’s life-time, if the father wishes it so, or after the
death of the father, and his brothers shall not complain—‘why should he
have two shares?’ If, however, such is not father’s wish, then he shall
be assigned by the others a share equal to their own.

If some of the sons become re-united with the father, after the
partition has been made, then the father’s share shall go to them; and
the additional property arising therefrom shall be assigned by them as
the share of the other brothers. This property thus accrues to the son
united with the father; also after the father’s death, he receives his
share out of that same property (?),—in accordance with what has been
said above under 210.

As regards the sisters, they are not entitled to any share until they
have borne a child,—as declared by Vaśiṣṭha.—(216)
