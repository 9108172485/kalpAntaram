**(verses 9.276-277)**

‘*Cut-purse*’—one who cuts out a purse; *i.e*., the opening of knots or
bundles of cloth. Or the name ‘cut-purse’ may apply to those persons who
are bent upon slinking away, on some pretext, with the property that has
been stolen,—after loosening the knots with which he may have been
bound.

When such a man has been detected in doing this for the first time, his
fingers shall be cut off; on the second occasion a hand and a foot; and
on the third, he shall suffer death.—(276-277)
