In regard to certain substances it has been declared that in exchanges
they shall be treated as equivalent:—*e.g*., Sesamum and paddy have been
declared to be equal; if in regard to such articles, some one treats
them as *unequal*—*i.e*., having advanced sesamum, he receives in
payment a larger quantity of paddy;—or even when there is no exchange,
in the act of buying and selling, if one buys sesamum at a price higher
than that given for paddy;—or in a case when one man has an upper
garment for sale, and another an under-clothing, and the latter stands
in need of the latter,—though the two are of equal value, yet knowing
the greater need of the man with the upper garment, the latter offers to
him the under-clothing, but not in equal exchange, but for a higher
price,—such a man is said to ‘*treat equals as unequals*’ in value.

The punishments prescribed are for both the buyer and the seller; since
both are parties to the act of ‘treating equals as unequals.’

The term ‘*vā*’, in this case is superfluous, serving only to fill up
the metre.

The two alternative fines—the ‘first’ and the ‘middlemost’—are laid
down, as to be determined by the value of the commodities
concerned.—(287)
