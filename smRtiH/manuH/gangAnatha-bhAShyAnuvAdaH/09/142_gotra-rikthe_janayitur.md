It is only right that the adopted son should have a share in his
adoptive father’s property; since he does not inherit either the
family-name or the property of his progenitor; and this for the simple
reason that he has gone out of the family.

Inasmuch as he does not inherit the family-name and the property of the
progenitor, he does not offer cakes to him; since ‘*the cake follows the
family-name and the property*’;—that is, a son offers the funeral cakes
etc., to that preson whose family-name and property he inherits.

‘*Ceases*’— drops away from him.

‘*Svadhā*’;—this syllable stands for that which makes the use of the
syllable ‘*svadhā*’ possible;—*i*. *e*., the *Śrāddha* and other
offerings. And when a man gives away his son to another man, those
offerings cease for him; that is. they should not be offered to him.

This law applies to the ‘made’ and other kinds of sons,—*i.e*., ‘the one
conceived before marriage,’ the ‘cast off’ and ‘the one who benefits
both.’

Others construe ‘*haret*’ as implying the causal form ‘*hārayet*’,
‘should deprive’; which means that the adopted son shall benefit both
fathers.

But the fact of the matter is that the verse opens with the
*relinquishing of privileges*; so that consistently with that, the
latter half also should mean that ‘no cake shall be offered’; *i.e*.,
the father also shall relinquish his privilege of receiving the cakes.

In the face of these facts, some authority will have to be found for
attributing a different meaning to the words (‘*haret*’ and the
rest).—(142)
