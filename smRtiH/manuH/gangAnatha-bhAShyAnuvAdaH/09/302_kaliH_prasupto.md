When he is ‘*asleep*’, inactive, he represents ‘*Kali*.’

‘*Awake*’,—*i.e*., while knowing the means of his advancement, if he
does not actually exert himself,—he is ‘*Dvāpara*.’ When he has made up
his mind to act he is ‘*Tretā*.’

When he actually acts with a view to attaining success, in accordance
with the scriptures, he is ‘*Kṛta*’.—(302)
