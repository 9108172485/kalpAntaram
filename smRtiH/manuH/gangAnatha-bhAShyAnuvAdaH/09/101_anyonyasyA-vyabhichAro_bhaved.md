‘*Fidelity*’—unstinted obedience in all actions. Says Āpastamba: (*a*)
‘The wife should not be neglected in matters relating to Duties, Wealth
and Pleasure’;—(*b*) ‘The highest good of man consists in Duty, Wealth
and Pleasure, as it is declared that the whole *fabric* rests upon these
three factors.’

Some people hold the following view:—“What is meant by ‘*fidelity*’ here
is *non-abandonment*; otherwise, as to the woman, so to the man also, it
would not he open to many more than one wife.”

This however is not right; because in regard to men there is a distinct
sanction—(a) ‘Those who act through mere lust, etc.,’ (b) ‘the barren
wife shall be superseded in the eighth year,’ and so forth; while there
is no such sanction in the case of women. There is another text also
which is indicative of the same fact—‘There are several wives for one
man, but not several husbands for a woman at the same time.’

‘*Until death*,’—till they die; *i.e*., it ends only when either of them
dies.

This should be understood to be the highest duty of man and wife, stated
in brief.—(101)
