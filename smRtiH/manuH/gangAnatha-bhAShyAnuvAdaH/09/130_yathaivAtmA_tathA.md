It has been said that the father shall declare—‘The child that is born
of her shall be mine;’ and a man’? child inherits his property; so that
at the time that the father dies, if the daughter has got no child, it
would seem that she cannot inherit his property; it is in view of this
that the present text lays down that she shall inherit it

‘*So long as she is there in her own real character*’—of being meant to
provide a son.

Or, it. may mean—‘while the father’s own self is there, in the shape of
the daughter.’

‘*The daughter is equal to the son*.’—Though the text uses the generic
term ‘daughter,’ yet from the context it is clear that it is the
‘appointed daughter’ that is clearly meant.—(130)
