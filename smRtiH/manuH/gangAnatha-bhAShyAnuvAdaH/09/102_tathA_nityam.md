‘*Should* *exert themselves*’— should make an effort; so that they may
not be unfaithful to each other;—*unfaithfulness* consisting in neglect,
want of co-operation in matters relating to Duty, Wealth and Pleasure.

‘*Passed through the rites*’—performed the rites of marriage.

This verse is meant to be a summing up of what has gone before, and not
the injunction of any thing new.—(102)
