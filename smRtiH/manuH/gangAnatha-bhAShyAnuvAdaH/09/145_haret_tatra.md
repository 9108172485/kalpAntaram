‘*Like the legitimate, son*’;—this has been enjoined here with a view to
permit the ‘preferential share’ ordained for the eldest brother; as no
other ‘equality’ is possible (between the two kinds of sons). What the
present, rule premite is the ‘preferential share’ for the ‘*Kṣetraja*’
son born of the eldest wife. To this extent, this is a exception to ‘the
equal shares’ laid down in verse 121. And since both the rules are
equally authoritative, they must he treated as optional
alternatives,—the adoption of the one or the other being dependent upon
the qualifications of the persons concerned. Apart from this there would
be no purpose in this verse; as all that is herein staled has been
already laid down elsewhere.

‘*That seed is of the owner of the soil*,’—because it serves his
purposes. This is purely commendatory; hence it is added
‘*legally*’—*i.e*., according to the law.

Another reason for this lies in the fact that the ‘*child*’—which is the
visible embodiment of the seed—belongs to the owner of the soil.

This verse is purely declamatory.—(145)
