It has been already declared that a man need not give what he acquires
by his learning; this verse lays down that he need not give what he
himself acquires by agriculture and other means.

“This verse alone would have been enough:^(‘)the man need not give,
unless he wishes it, what he acquires by his own labour’; what was the
need for the other verse making special mention of the ‘gains of
learning’?

The answer to this is that there is no individual^(‘)effort’ or ‘labour’
involved is the case of^(‘)friendly presents,’ ‘marriage presents,’ and
the like; hence it was necessary to have a distinct verse referring to
these.—(208)
