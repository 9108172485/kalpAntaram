‘*Child-bearing*’—Conception.

‘*Procreation*’—Impregnating.

‘*Hence*’—*i.e*., because of the act of child-begetting being dependent
upon both,—the man’s Religious Rites have been ordained in the Veda, as
being in common with his wife.

Consequently, since alone by himself he could not be entitled to the
performance of any rites, he shall not abandon his wife, even though she
be hostile.—(96).
