This is another eulogy on the eldest brother.

The right sort of eldest brother ‘*advances the family*’; and when the
same is devoid of qualities, he ‘*ruins it*.’ When the eldest brother
has a good character, his younger brothers also behave in the same
manner. And when not possessed of good qualities, all these quarrel
among themselves.—(109)
