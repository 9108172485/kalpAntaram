The *Kṣatriya* and the rest, when devoid of property, should not be
harassed by imprisonment; they should make good the amount of fine due
to the king ‘by *labour*’,—such work as may be in keeping with the
character of the man, and profitable to the king.

The Brāhmaṇa shall be made to pay it ‘*by instalments*’—so that his
family may not suffer from want. Imprisonment, beating and such
chastisements are forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa.

What has been laid down before pertains to the repayment of the debt to
the debtor, while the present verse pertains to the payment of fines.
There is thus no repetition.—(229)
