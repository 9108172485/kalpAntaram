‘*Form*’—as prescribed in the scriptures; what is done in accordance
with this—*i.e*., as laid down in 3.35 *et-seq*,—where the use of water
has been held by some to be meant for the case of maidens.

When one has, according to this form, accepted a maiden,—he may
‘*repudiate*, *her*’—before marriage is done.

‘*Blemished*’—disfigured by evil bodily marks, not perceived before.
Even though she may have been accepted, and be very handsome, yet if she
be found to be wanting in modesty, or harsh of tongue.

‘*Diseased*’— suffering from consumption.

‘*Corrupted*’—one who is known among men as suffering from an incurable
disease, or as being in love with another man.

Such a girl one may repudiate.

Some people have explained ‘*vipraduṣṭā*’ as ‘deflowered.’

This however is not accepted by others as right. So long as the girl has
not been enjoyed by a man, and as such remains a ‘maiden,’ she cannot be
regarded as ‘corrupted’; and after she has been enjoyed, she is no
longer a ‘maiden’; so that in this case there could be no sense in the
assertion that ‘one may repudiate the corrupted *maiden*.’ And the
abandoning of the ‘deflowerd’ girl has been already laid down before
(under 8.226).

‘*Betrothed by deception*’—actually wanting in limbs, or having
superfluous limbs.

Since the text mentions the presence of defects as the ground for
repudiation, it follows that even in the presence of such minor defects
as are not mentioned here,—one may abandon the girl, even after
betrothal.—(72)
