Ornaments that may have been given to her on previous occasions by her
brother or other relations, who would be ignorant of her desire to
choose her own husband,—all such ornaments she should hand back to them.
She is not to give up what has been given to her after she has actually
done the act

It is only when the ornament has been given to her beforehand by
persons, with the motive that she shall not be given to a particular
person,—and yet it is this same person that the girl chooses for her
husband,—it is not right for her to retain the gift

‘*Stenaḥ*,’ in the masculine form, is another reading for ‘*Stenā*’; in
which case the ‘theft’ would lie upon the bridegroom; in which case, the
father should force him to give up the ornament.—(92)
