An example is cited—‘*interlaced like the Triple Staff*—*i.e*., each is
dependent upon the other. This same idea is further emphasised—‘*since
their qualities are mutually helpful*;’—inasmuch as they are helpful to
one another, there can be no distinction among them; just as there is
none among the soil, the seed and the water, in the process of
cultivation.

From this it follows that special attention is to be paid to every one
of the seven limbs.

There certainly is some difference in their relative importance; what
then is meant by the assertion that ‘*no one of them is superior*’ is
that due care should always be taken in the guarding of the Ally and
other ‘limbs’ also (which, in the preceding verse, have been declared to
be of minor importance). Because the destruction of the Ally also would
eventually lead to the destruction of the King’s own kingdom, specially
when the attack upon the former comes from a powerful quarter; even
though the danger may be not so imminent.—(296)
