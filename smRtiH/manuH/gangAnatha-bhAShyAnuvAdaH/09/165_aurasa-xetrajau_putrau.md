The first half of this verse is only a reiteration of what has been
enjoined before, and not a distinct injunction; specially because the
‘soil-born’ son does not stand on an equal footing with the ‘body-born’
son.

The other sons inherit the ‘family name,’ and they inherit also ‘*a
share in the property*;’ and it has been already explained that this
‘share’ consists of *mere subsistence*. But the case of the ‘adopted’
son stands on the same footing as that of the ‘soil-born’ one. In
support of this view people quote other *Smṛti-texts*.

‘*According to their order*.’— The ‘body-born’ and the ‘soil-born’ sons
are entitled to inherit simultaneously; but among the rest, the
succeeding one inherits only in the absence of the preceding one.

“If only six of the sons are ‘heirs,’ and the other six are *not*
heirs,—according to the distinction into ‘heirs’ and ‘non-heirs’ made
(in 158), it cannot be right to declare all these to be *inheritors* of
property.”

As a matter of fact, those that have been described as ‘non-heirs’ are
so only in the presence of the ‘body-born’ son; all that is meant by the
distinction is that the first six are larger beneficiaries than the
second six.

Among the first group, all except the ‘body-born’ are equal
beneficiaries, and less than these latter are the six in the second
group; these latter are all equal, and there is no difference among
themselves, due to these being mentioned earlier or latter.—(165)
