‘*Impotent*’ and ‘*seedless*’, both denote absence of manly vigour; the
only difference is that while the former indicates *futility of the
seed*, the latter implies *total absence of virility*.

punishment.

‘*Wresting*’—means *confiscation. Banishment, stopping of food* and such
other punishments have been forbidden by other *Smṛti-texts*.—(79)
