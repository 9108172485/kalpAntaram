When the nuptial fee has been received by her father and other
relations, but she has not been given away,—only the verbal betrothal
having been done,—if, in the interval, the giver of the foe happen to
die, then there arises the doubt, as to whether she, in the manner of
other goods, shall revert to the younger brother-in-law, or to all
brothers, as in the ease of Yudhiṣṭhira and others, or in the absence of
brothers, to ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relations,—the text lays down the rule that
‘*she should he given to the younger brother-in-law*’;—not either to all
the brothers of her husband, or to all his ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ relations,—but to
his younger brother only. But hero also, only if the girl consents.

“In the event of the girl not consenting, what shall become of the
nuptial fee?”

If the girl desires to take to life-long celibacy, then the fee shall
remain with the members of her father’s family; but if she seeks for
another husband, then the fee shall be refunded out of the fee received
from this second man.—(97)
