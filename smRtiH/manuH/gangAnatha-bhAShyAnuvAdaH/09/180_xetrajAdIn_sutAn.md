‘*Substitute*’—when the ‘principal’ is not there; which means that these
other sons are to be taken only in the absence of the ‘legitimate’ son.

In other *Smṛtis*, these sons have been mentioned in a different order;
*e.g*., the ‘secretly born’ occupies the fifth place in one text, while
the sixth in another. But no significance attaches to the order in which
these? are mentioned; this is what is indicated by the fact that there
is no uniform order adopted by the *Smṛtis*. Even though no special
significance attaches to the order, yet a distinctly useful purpose is
served by it; as we shall explain later on.

These sons are taken ‘*with a view to*’— on account of—‘*the failure of
a religious duty*’; *i.e*., with a view to prevent the transgression of
the injunction that ‘one shall beget a child.’ This injunction is an
obligatory one, and as such, must, be acted up to by the Householder.
The principal method of doing this consists in begetting a ‘legitimate’
son; but in the absence of that, he may have recourse to the others here
described.—(180)
