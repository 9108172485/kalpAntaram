‘*The child that may be born of this girl shall be the performer of my
funeral rites*.’ The term ‘*svadhā*,’ stands for the *Śrāddha* and the
other after-death rites; it is not necessary that this shall be; the
exact formula uttered. Says Gautama (28.18)—‘The father, having no son,
shall offer sacrifices to Agni and Prajāpati, and shall give away the
appointed daughter, stipulating that *the child shall be for me*.’—The
opinion of some people is that the daughter becomes *appointed* by mere
intention, (28.19); from which it is clear that the daughter becomes
‘appointed’ even without the pronouncement of any definite formula.

“In the absence of a distinct stipulation, even though the intention may
be present in the father’s mind, yet, until it has been clearly
declared, the son-in-law may not agree (to surrender the child).”

It is in view of this that the text says—‘*Shall make his daughter an
appointed daughter*.’—(127)
