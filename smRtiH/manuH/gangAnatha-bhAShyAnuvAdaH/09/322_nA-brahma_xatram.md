The ‘*Kṣatriya*’—*i.e*., the realm.—‘*Without the Brāhmaṇa*’—*i.e*.,
where neither the councillors nor the priests and other officials are
Brāhmaṇas,—how can there be any prosperity?

Similarly Brāhmaṇas obtain prosperity only when resting upon Kṣatriyas.

When both are united, they are successful.

The terms ‘*Brahma*’ and ‘*Kṣatra*’ in this verse stand for the two
castes, *Brāhmaṇa* and *Kṣatriya*.—(322)
