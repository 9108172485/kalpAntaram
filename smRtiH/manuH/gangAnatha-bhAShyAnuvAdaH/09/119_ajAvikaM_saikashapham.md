‘*Animal with uncleft hoofs*;’—such as the horse, the mule, the ass etc.
When the number of cattle available do not admit of division in equal
numbers, then the odd animal should be given to the eldest brother; and
its value shall not be made good by giving (to the other brothers) other
things, nor shall the animal be sold and its value distributed among the
brothers equally.

‘*Ajāvikam*;’—the singular form is justified on the ground of its being
a copulative compound standing for animals.—(119)
