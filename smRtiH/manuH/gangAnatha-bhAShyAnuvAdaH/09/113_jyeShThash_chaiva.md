In a case where a man dies leaving more than three sons, the eldest and
the youngest shall receive their shares in the manner just stated, if
they are duly qualified; and (a) the ‘fortieth part’ which has been
ordained ‘for the qualified middlemost’ in the preceding verse, shall be
divided among the several middle ones; but (b) when all the middle ones
are qualified, each of them shall receive the ‘fortieth part’ of the
property. Both these methods of division are indicated by the words of
the text—‘to them *would belong the middlemost share*’—*i.e*., (a) the
middlemost share allotted to the middle brothers shall be given to all
the middle brothel’s conjointly; or (b) every one of them shall get it,
in accordance with their relative ages. The former of these would be
most proper in the case of all the middle brothers being unqualified; as
these do not deserve much property; and the latter method should apply
to the ease where all are duly qualified—(113)
