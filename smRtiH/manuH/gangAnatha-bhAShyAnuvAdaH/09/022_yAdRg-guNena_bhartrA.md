If a man wishes to guard his wife, he should guard himself also against
evil habits; and it is not the woman that should preserve her chastity.
Since if the man has a bad character, his wife also becomes the same;
just as the wife of a man possessed of good character becomes good. For
instance the river, though herself sweet-watered, becomes saline like
the Ocean, when she joins this latter.—(22)
