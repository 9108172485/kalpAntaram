‘*Will-disposed*’—towards her husband; devoted to his service.

The present verse enjoins—(a) that her consent is to be obtained, and
(b) that she shall not be disgraced. This applies also to the case of
the barren wife, and to that of one who bears only daughters; because,
all these have been mentioned in the same context; and in none of these
is there any reason why she should be disgraced.

‘*In no cane*’—never.

‘*Disgraced*’—in the form of harsh words addressed in admonition.—(82)
