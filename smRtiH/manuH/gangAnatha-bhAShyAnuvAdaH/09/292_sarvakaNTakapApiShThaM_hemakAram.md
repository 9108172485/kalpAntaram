Of all the ‘thorns’ described above, the goldsmith is *the worst*’

*Question*’.—If what is meant is the *selection* (of the ‘goldsmith from
among the ‘thorns’),—then why should not the compounding (in
‘*Sarvakaṇṭakapāpiṣṭham*’) be avoided \[in obedience to *Pāṇini*
2.2.10\]?

What is meant by his being ‘the worst of sinners’ is that the stealing
of a small quantity of gold involves a great sin, while the stealing of
gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa involves ‘the most heinous crime.’

For this reason, if the goldsmith behaves dishonestly, ‘*he shall be cut
to pieces*.’ Goldsmiths steal gold by manipulating the scales and during
the processes of heating and cutting.

In this case, considerations of the quantity stolen, or the caste of the
owner do not enter; repetition alone has to be taken into consideration;
*e.g*., in the ease of the first offence a fine shall be substituted for
the slicing of flesh with a razor.

It has already been explained that in the case of corporal punishment,
the sin disappears by virtue of the punishment inflicted—(292)
