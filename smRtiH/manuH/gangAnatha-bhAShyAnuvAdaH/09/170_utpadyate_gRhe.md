If the mother were not known, then the caste also of the child would not
be known; as it has been declared by the ancients that ‘the caste of the
child whose progenitor is not known can be ascertained from his mother.’

The rule here laid down refers to a case where there is no suspicion
regarding the progenitor being of a lower caste. In the evenṭ. of such
suspicion, there would be likelihood of an ‘admixture in the reverse
order’; and in that case, the son would not be entitled to perform the
functions of a ‘son.’—(170)
