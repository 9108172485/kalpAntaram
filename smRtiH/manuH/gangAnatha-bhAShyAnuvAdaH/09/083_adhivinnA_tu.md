For the wife going off in anger, caused by the super-session,—the
present text lays down two optional alternatives in the shape of
*confinement* or *divorce*. It would not be right in such a case for
either the mother-in-law or the father-in-law and other relations to
console her and appease her anger by means of presents of food and
clothing, or by sweet words, eta

‘Confinement’ consists in placing her in the charge of guards.

‘*Divorce*’, ‘*Casting off*’, has already been explained as consisting
in dropping intercourse with her, and avoiding her bed.

‘*Family*’—Relations, on the woman’s father’s side, as also those of the
husband’s own side.—(83)
