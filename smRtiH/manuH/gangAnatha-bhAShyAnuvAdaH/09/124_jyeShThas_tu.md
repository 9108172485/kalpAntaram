This verse puts forward another alternative regarding the ‘preferential
share’ in the ease of sons spoken of in the preceding verses.

If the elder son is born of the younger wife, he shall take *fifteen
rows*, and a hull as the sixteenth. That the fifteen are meant to be
*cows* is indicated by the mention of the *hull*;—the hull needs the cow
as its companion.

The ‘*others*’—the remaining sons—shall take the cows—‘*according to*
*the* *seniority of their mothers*;’—*i.e*., he whose mother is senior
shall take a better cow than the one that is taken by him whose mother
is junior.

Or, the verse may be taken as laying down an additional ‘preferential
share’ for the *son born of the elder wife*,—in addition to what has
been laid down in the preceding verse. In this case, there would be no
‘*a*’ before the word ‘*jyeṣṭhāyām*’ (which, in the former explanation
has been taken as ‘*ajyeṣṭhāyām*’).

It would appear to be necessary to consider what is exactly meant by the
expression ‘*according to the seniority of their mothers*.’ But,
inasmuch as the two verses (in which the phrase occurs) are purely
declamatory, we make no Attempt to find out its exact meaning.

What has been said hitherto is only by way of a preface; the settled
conclusion is going to be stated now (in the following verse).—(124)
