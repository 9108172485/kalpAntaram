‘*Worlds*’—the three regions, the earth and the rest.

‘*Gods*’—are dependent upon the Brāhmaṇas, through the libations offered
by these latter. The Gods are ‘dependent’ upon the Brāhmaṇas also, in
the sense that the greater part of Vedic teaching and Vedic rites are
done by them;—the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* not doing them to the same
extent.—(316)
