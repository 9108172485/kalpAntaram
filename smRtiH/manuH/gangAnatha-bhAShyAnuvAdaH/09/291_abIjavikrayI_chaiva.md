He who sells as ‘seed’ what is ‘*not seed*,’ by concealing its real
character. It is after the lapse of a long term that seeds germinate in
the field; so that it cannot be ascertained whether or not they are real
‘seeds.’

‘*He who picks out seed*’—good seed germinates quickly; the offender
therefore picks out the good seed and sells the remaining bad ones. Or,
the meaning may be that the man ‘*picks up the seeds*’ that have been
sown in the field and takes them away.

‘*Bounds*’—rules and practices sanctioned by scriptures and usage.

‘*Mutilation*’—cutting off of ears, nose etc.—(291)
