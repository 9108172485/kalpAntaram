**(verses 9.122-123)**

‘*Elder wjfe*’—married first:—‘*younger wife*’—one who was married
later.

As between the sons born of these wives, the question arises whether
‘seniority’ shall he determined by the order in which their mothers have
been married?—or, by the order in which they were themselves born?
Having raised this question, the author answers it in the next
verse;—this method being adopted with a view to making the rule more
easily comprehensible.—(122)

‘*Pūrvajaḥ*’—he who is horn of the ‘*pūrvā*,’ the *elder*, wife, though
himself *younger* (in age)—is entitled to one excellent hull.

The other bulls that there may be,—‘*which are not so good*’—shall he
allotted to the other several brothers, one to each.

Hence the ‘preferential share’ laid down for the son born of the eldest
wife consists of the *best bull*;—the superiority of his share
consisting only in the *quality* of the bull, not in the *number*.

‘*Those who are junior to him*’—*i.e*., to the son born of the eldest
wife.—Junior by what?—‘*On account of the position* *of* *their
mothers*’—*i.e*., according to the order of their marriage. Thus the
seniority among the sons is determined by the seniority of their
mothers, and not by their own age.—(123)
