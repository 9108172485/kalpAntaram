‘*Sītā*’—Stands for the *cultivated field*; and *implements* connected
therewith are the plough, the spade and so forth. For the stealing of
these punishment has to be inflicted.

Is this to be done arbitrarily? No; ‘*after taking into consideration
the time and uses*.’ That is, if the time for cultivation is near at
hand, the punishment shall be severe; and severer still when the field
has been already cultivated and a rich harvest is in prospect.

‘*Taking into consideration*’—having ascertained its advent. Under other
circumstances, the punishment shall be in accordance with the nature of
the object stolen.

Similarly in the case of ‘*arms*’—swords and the rest—if they are stolen
at the time of war, the punishment shall be severe;—or in the ease of
‘*medicines*’— if they are stolen at the time that they are going to be
actually administered,—and the chances are that if the medicine is
stolen and not administered, the patient shall suffer great pain;—and no
other medicine is available at the time,—and even if available, it
requires a long time for its preparation;—all these circumstances have
to be taken into consideration when determining the punishment.

In the case of ‘arms’, if they belong to the king,—or to persons who are
in constant dread of enemies and robbers (and hence need the arms for
self-defence),—the punishment shall be severe; but if they are some
small things, it shall be simple.—(293)
