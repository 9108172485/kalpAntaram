‘Behaving like the eldest brother’ consists (1) in treating the younger
brothers with love, like that towards a son,—(2) in supporting them and
looking after their property, like his own, and (3) in preventing them
from wrong acts?.

If he behaves otherwise, he should he honoured ‘*like a
kinsman*,’—*i.e*., like the maternal or paternal uncle; *i.e*., the
younger brothers shall stand up when they come up, and so forth. This
means that they shall not be entirely subservient to his wishes.—(110)
