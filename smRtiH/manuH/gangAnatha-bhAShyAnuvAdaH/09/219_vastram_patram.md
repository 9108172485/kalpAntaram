The singular number in ‘cloth,’ ‘conveyance‘ornament,’ and ‘cooked food’
is meant to be significant.

‘*Conveyance*’—vehicle; such as a chariot, a cart and so forth.

‘*Ornament*’—the ring and so forth.

‘*Cloth*’—of ordinary quality, not what is exceptionally valuable.

‘*Water*’—well, tank and so forth.

‘*Women*’—female slaves.

‘*Yogakṣeman*’—what is conducive (‘*kṣema*’) to welfare (‘*yoga*’);
*e.g*., experienced ministers, priests, councillors and so forth. These
are helpful in guarding the household against thieves and others.

In another *Smṛti* it is found that ‘there is no division of the
dwelling-house.’

‘*Pasture-ground*’—where the cattle graze.

From what is declared here it would follow that it is not absolutely
true that there is nothing wrong in dividing what has been left by the
father. But this denial is of that kind of which a transgression
involves no sin. (?)—(219)
