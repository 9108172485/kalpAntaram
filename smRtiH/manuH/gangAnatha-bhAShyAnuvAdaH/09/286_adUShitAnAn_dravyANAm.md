+++
When one, with a view to making a profit, adulterates a commodity,
which, by itself, is quite pure—*e.g*., when the dealer in grains mixes
straw and dust with grains harvested quite clean; or when one
adulterates saffron and other such substances with foreign substances.

‘*Gems*’—Pearls and the rest.

‘*Breaking*’—into pieces.

‘*Wrongly boring*’—*i.e*., boring at a place where boring should not be
done. ‘*Apavedha*’—is also derived from the root ‘*vyadh*’, to *pierce*;
the denotation of verbal roots being manifold.

Gems are classed as ‘good,’ ‘bad’ and ‘indifferent;’ and the punishment
shall be regulated in accordance with the class to which the gem in
question may belong; in the case of ‘indifferent’ gems, the fine shall
consist of the ‘middlemost amercement,’ and in that ‘good’ ones it shall
consist of the ‘highest amercement’—(286)
