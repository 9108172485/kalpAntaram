Throughout the realm, hidden spies should find out all that pertains to
the king’s business; and hence they are spoken of as his ‘eyes’, and the
king called ‘*spy-eyed*’.

Though the action of the ‘open’ thief does not stand on the same footing
as that of the ‘concealed’ one—such as those who prowl about at night in
forests etc.’—yet both have been mentioned together for the purpose of
indicating the equality of the punishment to be meted out to them.—(256)
