This is a declamatory supplement to the Injunction of begetting
children.

‘*The hell called Put*’—is the name given to the four kinds of elemental
life on the Earth. And from this is the father delivered by his son, as
soon as he is born; which means that he is born next in a divine life.

It is for this reason that he is called ‘*Putra*,’ ‘Deliverer from
Put.’—(138)
