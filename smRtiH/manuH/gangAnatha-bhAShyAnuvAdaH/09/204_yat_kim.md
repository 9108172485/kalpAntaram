If the eldest brother acquires more properly, either through some
hereditary friend, or from the king or his ministers or his priests, or
out of the farm, by the employment of special methods,—such property
shall be common to all the brothers; and the eldest brother shall not
entertain any such notion as that—‘this property, which was not acquired
by our father, has been acquired by me, through my own efforts, and
hence it is mine only.’

‘*Devoted to learning*’;—this shows that the rule here laid down
pertains to mechanics, artisans and others who subsist by learning; such
as physicians, dancers, musicians and so forth—(204)
