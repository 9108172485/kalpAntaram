‘*Kīnāśa*,’ ‘*ploughman*’,—the slave who tills the soil. Says the
*mantra text*—‘*Indra āsīt surapatiḥ, kīnāśā āsan-marutaḥ, yathāsutam
kīnāśā abhiyantu vāhaiḥ*’

‘*Conveyance*’ — cart and the rest.

‘*Ornament*’— the ring or some such ornament worn by the father.

‘*House*’— the principal apartment.

‘*One principal share*’;—among the several shares into which the
property may be divided, the most important of these shall go to the
*Brāhmaṇa* son.

All this should be set aside as the ‘preferential share’ for the
‘eldest’ son, and the rest of the property should be divided according
to the rule going to be laid down.—(150)
