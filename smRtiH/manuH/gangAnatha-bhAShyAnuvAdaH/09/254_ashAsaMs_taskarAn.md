‘*Repression*’;—the punishment of thieves and others according to rules
laid down in the Scriptures—by the inflicting of corporal and other
forms of punishment;—without which the protection of the people is not
possible.

Hence if the king receives taxes and yet fights shy of repressing
thieves, he incurs the two dangers—in this world, trouble in his
kingdom, and in the next, the loss of Heaven. It is only right that
blame should attach to the King who receives taxes and yet does not
repay it by service.—(254)
