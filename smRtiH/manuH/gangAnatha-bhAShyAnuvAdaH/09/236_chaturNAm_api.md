Even though the Brāhmaṇa alone becomes a heinous criminal by drinking
wine, yet even for him there is to be corporal punishment,—though no
corporal punishment has been laid down for the Brāhmaṇa before this.
This follows from the force laid upon the term ‘*four*’ in this verse.

Others, however, have explained this ‘*corporal punishment*’ as standing
for *branding*; and this would be done in the ease of the Brāhmaṇa also.

Others again explain the particle ‘*api*’ as ‘*even*,’ and declare that
the penalty here laid down is meant for all the *five* kinds of ‘heinous
criminals;’ the construction being that—‘this punishment is to be
inflicted on *even* all these four, as also on the *fifth*, in the shape
of the person associating with these four.’

For the crime of ‘*Brāhmaṇa-slaying*,’ ‘corporal punishment’ has been
already laid down above,—in the rule that—‘the king shall put to death
those who kill a woman, an infant or a Brāhmaṇa.’

From what follows in the next verse it is clear that ‘corporal
punishment’ here stands for *branding*.

‘*According to the late*’—‘he shall make due discrimination regarding
the greater, or less seriousness of the crime.’—(236)
