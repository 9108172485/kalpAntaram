**(verses 9.318-319)**

What is said here has already gone before. The sense is that even though
ill-behaved, the Brāhmaṇa shall not be ill-treated.

‘*Undesirable*’—forbidden.

When they betake themselves to forbidden acts, they shall be dealt and
punished according to law, gently, and not attacked with force, in the
manner of other castes.—(318-319)
