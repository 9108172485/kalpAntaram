‘*Forgers of Royal proclamations*’—give out as done by the king what is
not done by him. ‘*Proclamations*’—royal edicts such orders as ‘No one
shall eat at the house of such and such a person’, ‘such and such a
favour has been conferred upon this man’, ‘such is the law that has been
laid down by the king’, and so forth—are always entered upon a piece of
paper, written by the hand of the royal scribe, and are then known as
the ‘Royal proclamation’. And people may forge these—*i.e*.,
misrepresent them.

‘*Sowers of disaffection among the people*’,—who spread disaffection
among such of the people as may have some grievance or may be too greedy
and so forth;—also the slayers of woman and infants and of
Brāhmnṇas;—‘those that serve his enemies’—secretly carrying on visits to
them.—(232)
