‘*Trusted servants*’—Those who would act in the right manner at the
right moment; *i.e*., persons ever on the alert; and hence considered
fit for being employed in the harem, as chamberlains.

Women who are ‘*confined*’—not allowed to go about freely—in the house
under such men, are not really well-guarded; but those are ‘*who guard
themselves by themselves*.’

And how are they to guard themselves?

Just when they are employed as above.

This verse is meant to be a praise of the method laid down in the
preceding verse, and it does not exclude other methods.—(12)
