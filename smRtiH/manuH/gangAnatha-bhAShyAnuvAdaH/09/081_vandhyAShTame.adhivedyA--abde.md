The text proceeds to lay down the supersession of other kinds of wives.

Among these, the barren one should be superseded in the eighth year; in
the tenth, she whose children die off.

By marrying a second wife the man shall save himself from the
contingency of disobeying the injunction regarding the Laying of Fire
(to which a childless person is not entitled), and that regarding the
begetting of children,—to which he would be liable by reason of his wife
being childless. Because, the Laying of Fire is not found to be
prescribed for a sonless person.

The same holds good regarding the wife that bears only daughters; as
also she whose children die off.

As regards the wife who is harsh of speech, as there is no such serious
defect, there need be no supersession; and she may be forgiven.—(81)
