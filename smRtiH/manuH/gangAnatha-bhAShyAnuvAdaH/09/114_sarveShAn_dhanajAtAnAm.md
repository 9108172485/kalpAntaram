The first half of the verse only reiterates what has been said above
regarding the eldest brother taking the be of the chattels.

The terra ‘*jāta*’ is synonymous with ‘*jāti*,’ ‘kind’; or it may mean
‘variety.’

‘*First-born*’—eldest.

‘*Best*’—most excellent.

‘*Anything particularly good*;’—such as a piece of cloth or an ornament

‘*Best of ten*.’—He shall take the best one among the ten. That is, if
there are ten cows or horses, he shall take the best among these. The
term ‘ten’ is used in the sense of a *group consisting of ten*.

Others explain ‘*daśataḥ*’ as ending in the ‘*tasi*’ affix, which has
the reflexive sense, and hence meaning ‘*ten*’ (not ‘from among ten’);
and according to this they read ‘*varān*’ in the plural (for ‘*varam*’);
and the sense in this case is that he should take *ten good animals*.

Others again declare that the term refers to a particular kind of
animals; those that have single hoofs, for instance (?).—(114)
