The king shall ‘*establish*’—place—houses of incarceration on all
well-known roads,—where the ‘*suffering offenders might be seen*;’—this
implies that the position of the prisons shall be so arranged as to fall
within such places as are passed by ordinary passers-by; and it follows
from this that various forms of torture shall be inflicted on the
prisoners.

‘*Disfigured*’—the condition of their body being altered by either total
starving or reduced rations.

The rest is quite clear.—(288)
