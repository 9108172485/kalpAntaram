It has been said in the preceding verse that in the absence of a
compact, the produce belongs to the owner of the soil. The question that
arises next is—In case there is a compact, does the crop belong to the
owner of the seed or to both? It. is in answer to this that the present
verse declares that it belongs to both.

^(‘)*Acceptance of the compact*.’—The term^(‘)*Kriyā*’ stands for the
compact, the agreement, that^(‘)this shall be so and so’;—when such
compact has been ‘accepted,’—‘*it’—i.e*., the ‘*seed*,’ as is clear from
the context—is^(‘)*given*’—‘*for the purpose of sowing*’—*i.e*., for the
purpose of the raising of the crop,—then of this crop both are
sharers.—(53)
