This verse precludes the idea that the son of the elder brother begotten
by the method of ‘authorisation’ is entitled to the ‘preferential share’
that would have been his father’s.

‘*The division in that case shall equal*’—That is, there shall be no
‘preferential share;’ nor shall the eldest receive ‘one more’ (as laid
down in 117), or the ‘some trifle’ (laid down in 115).

It shall be equal:—equal to whom? To that of his begetter—his younger
uncle.

The son horn without ‘authorisation’ is not entitled to any share,—as is
going to be declared later on.

This text, is indicative of the rule that when the brother is not alive,
the division shall be between the surviving brother and his nephew.
