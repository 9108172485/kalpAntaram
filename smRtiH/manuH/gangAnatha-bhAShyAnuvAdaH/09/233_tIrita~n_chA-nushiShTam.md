Whenever a transaction in the King’s Court has been ‘*finally
settled*’,—the root ‘*tīr*’ (in ‘*tirtam*’) denoting
*completion*,—*i.e*. definitely concluded,—not only verbally, but duly
recorded;—as also ‘when a punishment has been inflicted’;—all this the
king shall ‘*accept as lawfully done, and shall not annul it*’;—except
in the case of the doubling of a fine,—which is thus recommended—‘the
king shall revise the case with a view to inflicting a double
fine’.—(233)
