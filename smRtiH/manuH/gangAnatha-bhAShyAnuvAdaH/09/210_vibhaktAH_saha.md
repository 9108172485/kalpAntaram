The meaning of the verse is quite clear. It is meant to forbid the
‘preferential share’ which would appear to be the standing rule in
connection with all partition; specially in view of what has been said
above (205) regarding ‘the property being not acquired by the
father’(205). It is only out of all kinds of property *acquired by the
father* that there is to be a ‘preferential share.’ In the present case,
however, the property might in a sense be regarded as ‘acquired by the
father,’ and hence, the possibility of the ‘preferential share,’—which,
therefore, has had to be expressly denied.—(210)
