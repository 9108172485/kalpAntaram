‘*Pāṇigrāha*’ is *husband*;—of him ‘*whatever ill*’— disagreeable, in
the form contact with other men—‘*she*’—the woman—‘*thinks of*;’—of that
mental transgression, the ‘*expiation*’— purification—is expressed by
the aforesaid *text*, if used in the right manner at the proper rite.

By the way the author has indicated the use of the particular text. Even
though the use of such texts lies in forming part of the ritual, yet
what is meant is that when the particular text is laid down as to be
recited, it serves the purpose of expiating the sin of
transgression.—(21)
