‘*Utkṛṣṭāyci-abhirupāya*.’—The first term qualifies the second; and the
meaning is ‘who is of exceptionally distinguished appearance.’—Or, the
two terms may be taken as two distinct qualifications—‘*utkṛṣṭāya*’
meaning ‘one whose caste and other qualifications are remarkable,’ and
‘*abhirūpāya*’ meaning ‘handsome’;—the literal signification of the term
being ‘*rūpam ābhimukhyena prāptaḥ*,’ ‘who has acquired a good
appearance.’—Or, ‘*abhirūpāya*’ may mean *well-disposed*; it is in this
sense that a learned man also is called ‘*abhirūpa*.’

‘*Equal*’—in caste and other matters.

‘*Bridegroom*’—one who marries; the son-in-law.

‘*She who has not attained*’;—*i.e*., who has no carnal desires aroused,
who is still too young, not having reached the youthful age,—called
‘*nagnikā*’ in another *Smṛti-text*; *i.e*., one in whom the sexual
instinct has not arisen, who is only eight or six years old,—but not a
mere *infant*; as is indicated by the qualifications (elsewhere)—‘one
who is eight years old.’ This same qualification may also be indicative
of the fact that marriage is meant to be conducive to spiritual merit If
mere Lust were the sole inducement to Marriage, wherefore could there be
any marriage of the girl ‘*who has not attained her age*’?

There is no force however in this; as people are found to many very
young girls with a view to her dowry. And it has been fully explained
under Discourse III that all forms of activity are not in accordance
with what is laid down in the scriptures.—(88)
