When the King begins to be harassed by old age, if be finds that he has
done all that he bad to do,—then if he has any wealth,—such as that
accumulated from fines—he shall give all this away to *Brāhmaṇas*. As
for fines realised from the ‘heinous offenders,’ it has been already
laid down that they shall be disposed of by being offered to Varuṇa, and
none of it shall be taken by the King himself. But when he finds that
apart from this there is much wealth that has accumulated from all kinds
of fines,—and he realises that his death is approaching,—he should
dispose of the wealth in the manner here described.

Others have explained that the term ‘*fines*’ is meant to include all
sources of income—such as taxes, tolls and the like.

According to this the meaning would be that he should give away all his
wealth; that is, he should give away everything, with the exception of
chariots, arms, lands and slaves.

Under this explanation, the clause, ‘making over the kingdom to his son’
would not be quite consistent Because it would be impossible for the son
to carry on the administration, with a depleted treasury.

‘*Bring about his departure in battle*,’—*i.e*., he shall go forth to
battle, with a view to give up his life. If even towards the end of his
life, he finds no chances for a battle, then he should destroy his body
either in fire or water. But the best results would be attained by
giving up the body in battle.—(323)
