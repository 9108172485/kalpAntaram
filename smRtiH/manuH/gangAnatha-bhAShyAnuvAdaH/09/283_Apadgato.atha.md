‘*One in urgent necessity*’—described above.

‘*The aged person*’—and others include all those who are unable to go
away out of the village.

Blood also is included under ‘*filth*.’

‘These shall *be reprimanded*’—with such words as ‘you shall not do this
again,—if you do it yon will be committing a great crime against the
king.’ Such words said in an angry tone are what is meant by
‘reprimand.’

‘*It should be cleared*’,—this is an advice meant for the king;
specially if the person who committed the nuisance cannot be discovered.
In such cases, the public road shall be cleaned by *Caṇḍālas*.—(283)
