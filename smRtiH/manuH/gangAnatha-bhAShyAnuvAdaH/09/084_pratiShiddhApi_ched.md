‘*Forbidden*’,—by elders and relations.

The fine here prescribed is for the woman belonging to the *Kṣatriya*
and other lower castes; and not for the

Brāhmaṇa woman, who cannot be let off by the small fine here prescribed;
in her case the fine shall be a heavy one. Further, there is no chance
of the latter partaking of wine at festivals. It is only the former
class of women for whom wine-drinking is not entirely prohibited, who
are found to give themselves to much drinking, when they come together
on festive occasions; and it is in view of this that they are forbidden.

This fine is to be inflicted by the husband. Even though the inflicting
of punishments in the duty of the king, yet, inasmuch as the husband is
the ‘lord’ of his wife, he is regarded as competent to inflict the fine;
specially as it is found that people are considered free to inflict
fines upon servants and other dependents, in certain cases.

‘*Festivals*’—rejoicings in connection with the birth of a son,
marriages and the like.

‘*Shows*’—theatrical and other spetacles (spectacles?).

‘*Assemblies*’—large crowds of men.

This fine is to be imposed upon the woman who evinces anxiety to visit
these.—(84)
