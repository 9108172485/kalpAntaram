What the injunction means is that the maiden married should be so much
younger than the man;—and not that marriage must be done only at. the
age stated. Nor is any stress meant to be laid upon the exact number of
years mentioned; all that is meant is that one should many a girl *very
much younger* than himself.

This injunction does not occur in the section dealing with Marriage;
hence, what is stated here cannot he regarded as a qualification of the
persons undergoing that sacrament, and consequently, as an essential
factor in the rite itself; for this same reason, it cannot be taken as
precluding the age of ‘ten’ or ‘twenty-five’ or such others.

“But it is often found that even though laid down in a distinct passage,
a detail does form an essential factor of an act”

True; but the very fact that the teacher has thought it fit to place the
present text apart from the section on marriage is clearly indicative of
the fact that he had some special purpose in this.

The practice of cultured men is also as we have stated.

Further, the age here stated can never be observed in the case of one’s
son marrying a second time; so that, if the injunction were meant to be
taken literally, it would mean that there should be no second marriage;
and this would be absurd.—(94)
