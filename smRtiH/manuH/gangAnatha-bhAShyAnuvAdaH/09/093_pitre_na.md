This prohibits the payment of nuptial fees in the case of the girl who
has reached puberty, and who is intended to be given away for a fee; and
the reason for this is that—‘*he would fall off from his ownership*.’ It
is only during *childhood* that the girl is to live under the tutilage
of her father; so that when she is taken away by a man after she has
reached a higher age,—the father’s ownership over her has ceased.

Even in the case of a girl who is not intended to be given away for a
fee, the father’s ownership ceases,—the grounds for such cessation
(*i.e*., the girl having reached the higher age) being equally present
in her ease also.

‘*Falling off*’ means *cessation*.

‘*Thwarting*’—impeding its fruition in the shape of bearing children.

Some people say that this verse does not belong to Manu.—(93)
