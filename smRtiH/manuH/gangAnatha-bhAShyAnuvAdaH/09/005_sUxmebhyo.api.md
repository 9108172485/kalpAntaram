‘*Attachment*’— association, with a woman of unknown character,—one who
is in the habit of standing at the doorway, looking at gaily dressed
young men passing by, and so forth.

The meaning is that they should be guarded against temptations. Even
though the acts mentioned above,—*i,e*. gazing at young men and so forth
are not wrong in themselves, nor is the association of women with women
wrong in itself.

   \*         \*

Against these they should be ‘*guarded*’; they should be checked.

‘*Specialty*’ with particular care.

\*         \*         \*     
   \*         \*       
 \*

Thus the meaning is that the woman should be guarded by all the men of
the family, her brother, father, brother-in-law, and the rest.
