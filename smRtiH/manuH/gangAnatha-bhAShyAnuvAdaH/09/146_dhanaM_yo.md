‘*Shall beget a child for that brother*’—*i.e*., by the mode
of^(‘)authorisation.’

‘*Shall give the property to that child*;’—nor to its mother.

It is in accordance with this principle that women are entitled to
*maintenance*, and not to *ownership* of properties; as they are taken
care of in oilier ways.

^(‘)*His property*’—*i.e*., the property of the separated brother.—(146)
