In the case of a Śūdra, the child born from an unmarried woman, or from
an unauthorised woman, is a ‘son.’ From the text, it is clear that if a
slave were to beget a child upon a female slave belonging to another
slave, that child would belong to the former, and not to the latter.

‘*When permitted*’—by his father—‘*shall receive a share*’—equal to that
of the ‘legitimate’ son; when the partition is done during the father’s
life-time, or when the father has declared to his sons that ‘this child
is entitled to a share equal to yours.’

If, however, the father does not permit it, what should he done has been
declared in another *Smṛti*—‘The son born to a Śūdra from a female slave
shall receive a share according to the wish—\[of his father, *i.e*., as
much as his father permits him to take\],—*but on the fathers death, his
brothers shall allot to him a half-share*; \[that is, they shall give
him half of their own share; if they themselves take two shares each,
they shall give him one\];—if he has no brothers, he shall take the
entire property, except when there are daughter’s sons;—*i.e*., in the
absence of ‘legitimate’ sons, he shall inherit the whole property, but
only if there is no daughter’s son; if the daughter’s son is there, this
latter shall be treated like a ‘legitimate’ son; because, nothing else
is mentioned in connection with the daughter’s son, and it is he that is
presented to the mind by the context.

In the case of the *Brāhmaṇa* and other castes, the sons of slave-girls
are entitled to mere subsistence.

Such is the law.—(179)
