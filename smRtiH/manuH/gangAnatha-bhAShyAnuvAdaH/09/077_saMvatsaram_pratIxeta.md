‘*Hating*’—she who hates her husband.

The meaning of the verse is that he shall not turn her out of the house.
Though the use of the root ‘*vas*’ with ‘*sam*’ is not compatible with
the Accusative ending in ‘*enam*’; and ‘*samvaset*’, ‘co-habit’, would
stand for ‘*samvāsayet*’, ‘allowed to live with him yet it should be
taken to mean ‘chiding’. Even in the case of grievious sins, the woman
is not to be turned away, since it has been laid down that ‘she is to be
kept imprisoned in one room’; similarly, in the case of expiatory rites
in connection with such sins. The confiscation of her property also is
for the purpose of bringing her to her senses; and it does not mean
absolute taking away of all her belongings.—(77)
