It has been said (*yājñavalkya*, 2.116) that—‘an unequal division has
been declared to be legal, if made by the father’;—it is this that is
denied here.

‘*Joint concern*,’—*i.e*., when all of them together earn something—one
by agriculture, another by receiving gifts, another by service, while
another takes care of what is earned by others, and invests them and
uses them to the advantage of all;—all this shall be brought together
and divided equally; and no excessive share shall be given to any one by
the father, through his love for him.—(215)
