Among five-nailed animals, the Porcupine and the rest are fit to be
eaten.

In another *Smṛti*, there is option regarding the Rhinoceros. Says
Vaśiṣṭha (14-4?)—‘They dispute about the rhinoceros.’

With the exception of the camel, all those animals are fit to be eaten
which have only one line of teeth: for instance, the cow, the gout and
the deer.

“In as much as the present verse specifies the porcupine &c. as alone
fit to be eaten, among five-nailed animals,—it follows that all the
other five-nailed animals are unfit to be eaten; so that the prohibition
of ‘all five-nailed animals’ becomes entirely superfluous.”

There is nothing wrong in this. When the prohibition is stated in so
many words, our comprehension of it is *direct*; if on the other hand,
we were to derive our knowledge of what should not be eaten from the
specification of what should be eaten, our comprehension of the
prohibition would be only inferential, indirect; and this would he a
complicated process.—(18).
