Some people think that the term ‘*his own*’ qualifies the ‘Teacher’
only; and it serves to exclude the Teacher’s Teacher, would be thought
of as deserving the same treatment, according to what has been said

‘father’ and the ‘mother.’ But it may be explained as emphasising the
obligatory character of the rule as regards these particular
*relations*.

‘*Monitor*’, ‘*Guru*’,—is one who has been described in 2.149.

these persons; and what the text means by this specification is that
there is interference in the observances by the carrying of the dead
bodies of persons other than these—(90).
