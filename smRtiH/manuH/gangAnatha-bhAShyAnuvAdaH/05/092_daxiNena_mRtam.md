The term ‘*City*’ stands for the village &c. also.

This rule applies to those places where there are several gates; the
advice pertaining to such persons as may be capable of following it.

The *Śūdra* has been mentioned first, because it is an inauspicious
subject. And this reversal of the order indicates that the term
‘*respectively*’ indicates that the *Vaiśya* should be carried by the
western, the *Kṣatriya* by the northern and the *Brāhmaṇa* by the
Eastern gate.—(91)
