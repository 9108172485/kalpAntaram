A general rule of conduct is here laid down for the better class of
*Śūdras*.

‘*Living according to law*;’—*i.e*. attending on twice-born men and
performing the great sacrifices. By these ‘*shaving*’—of the head—shall
be done ‘*every month*’. The Genitive in *Śūdrāṇām* has the sense of the
Instrumental. Or, in as much as *śūdras* are entirely dependent upon
Brāhmaṇas their shaving shall be got done by these latter; and in this
case the root ‘*kṛ*,’ which has several meanings, is to be taken in the
sense of *advising*.

The details of the manner of purification—in connection with births,
deaths and the rest—should be like those of the *Vaisḥya*.

‘*Their food shall consist of the leavings, or twice-born men*.’—This
has been already explained before.—(138).
