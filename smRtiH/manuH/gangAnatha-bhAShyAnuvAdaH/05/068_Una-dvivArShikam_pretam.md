The child whose sacramental rites have not been performed, and since
whose birth less than two years have elapsed, is called ‘*less than two
years old*’. Such a child, when it dies, ‘*the relations should place
outside*’—the village —‘*under the ground*,’ that has been dug out.

Another *Smṛti* -text contains the word ‘*nikhavet* (?)’. should bury’.

‘*Having decked*’—with ornaments befitting the dead. The ‘*decking*’,
mentioned here in connection with the child ‘few *than two years old*’,
should be understood, on the strength of usage, to apply to those also
whose sacramental rites have been performed.

‘*Clean*’—where there are no bones. That is, the ground that is clean by
reason of the absence of heaps of bones,—under such a ground should the
child he placed. As a rule, the crematorium abounds in heaps of bones;
hence what the present text means is that the child should be buried in
a place other than the crematorium; and it does not mean that in this
case the rite of ‘bone-collecting’ shall not be performed: because this
later fact is already implied by the absence of burning in the
case.—(67)
