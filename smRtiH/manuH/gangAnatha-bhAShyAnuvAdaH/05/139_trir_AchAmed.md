This is the reiteration (of a former injunction), for the purpose of
enjoining what is necessary for the woman and the *Śūdra*. Though what
is said here has been already declared before, yet it is repeated here
for the sake of women and *Śūdras*.

Some people explain this text as follows:—According to the rule that
‘the Śūdra is purified by touching water’, all that the ordinary Śūdra
is to do is to touch water; hence washing and touching of the ear, etc.,
that are understood as applying to the

*Śūdra*, are regarded as pertaining to the better class of *Śūdras*. As
regards women,—the general rule being that ‘the Brāhmaṇa is purified by
water reaching the heart &c., &c.’ (2. 62), where the different castes
are specified, it would seem as if all that is prescribed for males is
to be done by females also; and it is with a view to preclude this
notion that we have the present text.

‘*Desiring bodily purification*’;—this indicates that if one is quite
clean when going to read or to take food, he need not necessarily repeat
the acts *thrice*; nor need there be *washing*;—*all* that need be done
is the sipping of some quantity of water, and the touching of the
organs; and not all the details that have been laid down in connection
with the ‘sipping of water’ prescribed among the duties of the
Student.—(137).
