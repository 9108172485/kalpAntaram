‘*Unintentionally*’—unwillingly,—^(‘)*having eaten these*’—any one of
the six just mentioned that it is any *one* that is meant, and not *all
together*, is indicated by the fact that the act of eating in this case
is nor. what is actually *enjoined*.

^(‘)*In* *the case* *of* *the rest*’—*i.e*. in the case of eating the
other things—‘red exudations from trees’ and other things forbidden
above,—one should desist from eating ‘*for a day*’;—the term^(‘)day’ is
used as including the *night* also; *e.g*. in such passages as^(‘)the
day is dark, the day is bright’ —(*Ṛgveda* 6.9.1.)

In connection with the eating of some of the things here forbidden, the
text is going to prescribe in the section on Expiatory

Rites (Discourse 11) distinct expiatory rites:—*e.g*., in connection
with^(‘)carnivorous animals, pig etc.’ (11.156); and in this case those
are the Rites to be performed; since they have been directly enjoined in
so man words; specially as the single ‘day’s fast’ here prescribed will
have its application only in cases other than those especially provided
for.—(20)
