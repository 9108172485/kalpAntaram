The term ‘born’ is to be construed separately with each of the two terms
with which it is compounded. He is said to be ^(‘)*born in vain*’ who
does not worship Gods, Pitṛs or Men; *i*. *e*. he who does not lead the
life proper for uny of the four stages of life, even though he is
capable of doing so; one who is excluded from all offerings and
invitations. Having referred to the man ‘who for one year does not lead
the life proper for any stage,’ the scriptures speak of a great sin
attaching to persons doing this for any length of time. This is so
because with the exception of the Student and the Renunciate, all the
others have to cook food for other people; and it is only cooking for
one’s own self alone that has been prohibited.

‘*Born of intermixture*;’—*i.e*., the *Āyogara*’ and other persons born
of an improper and inverse mixture of the several castes; that the issue
of improper mixtures is meant is indicated by its association with those
‘born in vain,’ which implies lowness of birth. As regards the issue of
legal mixtures, even though these also are ‘born of intermixtures,’ yet
these are not meant here, because they belong definitely to their
mother’s caste and are entitled to all that pertains thereto. Further,
in ordinary usage children of legal mixtures are not spoken of as being
of ‘mixed origin’; *e.g*. in 10.25, where the issues of ‘mixed origin’
are described. The term also includes (*a*) the children of such widows
as have not been ‘permitted’ to beget children, born of the intercourse
of several men, and (*b*) the children of prostitutes; the children of
women begotten by a person other than their husbands are not included in
this category, if there has not been intercourse with several men.

Some people hold that this prohibition refers to *Sapiṇḍa* relations who
are as described, and not to their sons; while in the case of those who
have ‘*abandoned themselves*,’ it applies to their sons also.

This however is not right; as the text makes no distinction among those
mentioned.

*Asceticisms*; *i.e*., of heretics, such as the ‘*Bhagala*,’ the
‘*Raktapaṭa*’ and the rest. That these are meant is indicated by the
plural number and by the fact that it is the heterodox heretic alone
that is excluded. These are regarded as ‘heterodox’ by reason of their
observances &c., being different from those of the orthodox ascetics.

‘*Those who have abandoned themselves*;’—*i.e* ., those who, even before
their life’s span has been run out, give up their bodies (by committing
suicide). \[It is only such suicide that is reprehensible\]. It is
considered quite desirable in the case of old men suffering from
incurable diseases given up by the physicians; as has been thus
declared:—‘If an old man,—incapable of purification and memory, who has
passed beyond the reach of the physician’s art,—kills himself by falling
down from a precipice, or entering into fire, or by fasting, or by
drowning in water,—in his case there is impurity for three days; his
bones being collected on the second day, on the third day the water
offering-should be made, and on the fourth day the *Śrāddha* should be
performed’. Suicide is regarded as desirable also in the case of persons
suffering from leprosy and such other diseases; as has been said in
connection with men who, though still in the Householder’s state, have
lost all energy,—‘Bent upon entering the Great Path, they do not wish to
live on uselessly.’ That man is called ‘devoid of energy’ who is
incapable of doing purificatory acts, as also saying the Twilight
Prayers *&c*. Then again, in texts deprecating suicide, the words used
are—‘if one whose body has not been emaciated, or who has not lost all
energy, should kill himself &c. &c.’; which implies that it is permitted
for those who are not such as here described.

Other Smṛti-texts prohibit the water-offering for other persons also. It
has been thus declared—‘Those killed by kings, those killed by horned or
fanged animals, or by serpents, and those who have abandoned
themselves,—to these no *Śrāddha* is to be offered; and water,
ball-offerings and other offerings that are made to the dead, all this
does not reach them, it becomes lost in the intervening regions. Through
fear of popular blame, one should make the *Nārāyaṇa* offering; and for
the sake of these also food-grains, along with the additional fee, shall
be given.’

Elsewhere again—

‘Sinful men meet death from the *Cāṇḍāla*, from water, from serpents,
from Brāhmaṇas, from lightning and from fanged animals.’

It is also laid down that—

‘For incendiaries, for keepers of baths and makers of ornaments and for
professional mourners, there is purification after the performance of
two *Taptakṛcchra* penances. Hence for these no after-death rites shall
be performed by others; even the name of such persons, or of their
family, should not be pronounced. For truly fearful is the uttering of
the name of such a great sinner, who has gone to the worst hells.’

It is in connection with the acts mentioned here that Saṃvartn has
prescribed the ‘*Sāntapana*’ penance; and Parāśara has laid down the
‘*Taptakṛcchra*’; and Vaśiṣṭha has prescribed the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ along
with the ^(‘)*Taptakṛcchra*’. But these differences may be ignored.

With reference to what has been said above regarding ‘the death of
sinners’ resulting from ‘the Cāṇḍāla, from water &c. &c.,’ there arises
the following question—“Does this rule, regarding the non-performance of
the *Śrāddha* and the performance of penance, pertain to the Cāṇḍāla who
kills himself intentionally?—or to one who is killed through
carelessness, without intention?”

Why should this question arise?

> \(A\) Well, Gautama (14.12) has said—‘In the case of those dying from
> hunger, by a weapon, by fire, by poison, in water, in prison, or from
> a precipice,—it is only when it is unintentional.’ While in the verse

From this it follows that what is meant is *intentional* death.

From all this (A, B, C and D) there arises the above-mentioned doubt—as
to what is the right view.

> The right view is that *intentional suicides* are what are

“But it has been said and pointed out above that the causes of death
spoken of do not resemble the sword and other things used by suicides;
so that the intentional killing of oneself could not be meant.”

Our answer to this is as follows:—If a man does not guard himself
against a danger, he is regarded to be as good as having brought it upon
himself. So that if a man wanders about alone in a forest infested with
*cāṇḍālas* and robbers,—even though he may not have the wish that they
should kill him, yet—there is disobedience of scriptures on his part,
since he acts in a way that invites danger, and he does nothing to avert
that danger. Similarly with the man who goes to swim in the river, or
enters a boat of doubtful capacity rowed by incompetent boatsmen. Under
such circumstances, if by the loss of vigour, or by the turning over of
the boat, the man should happen to die, it would be only right to regard
him as having committed a sin. On the contrary, if persons were to bathe
in water, whose depth they have duly ascertained by means of sticks
etc., and of the presence wherein of alligators and other animals they,
are ignorant,—and were to be carried away by any such animals, no blame
would attach to them. Similarly if one gets into a boat, which is
well-fastened, and rowed by capable rowers, and proceeds to cross a
swift stream,—if, on the sudden rising of a strong wind, the boat happen
to be tossed on a whril (whirl?)-pool and capsize, and the man become
drowned,—he would not have transgressed the scriptures at all. Similarly
again, if one did not carefully avoid places known to be infested with
snakes, and being bitten by a snake were to die, he would have acted
sinfully; not otherwise. Similarly if one does not run to a safe
distance, on seeing a sharp-horned cow or an elephant, and become
killed, he is rightly regarded as sinful. Similarly again if, when it is
raining heavily and lightning is flashing, if one wanders about in
desolate places and does not take shelter in a village or town,—his
action is reprehensible. While if the lightning should, by chance,
happen to fall upon a man who is in the village, there would be nothing
sinful on the part of the man. For these reasons it is always right and
proper that the man should do all that has been laid down (for his
safety).

The prohibiting of ‘water-offerings’ should be taken as applicable to
all kinds of after-death rites; for such is the view propounded in
another *Smṛti* -text.—(88)
