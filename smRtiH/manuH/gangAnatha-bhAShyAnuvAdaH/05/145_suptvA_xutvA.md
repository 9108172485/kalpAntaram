‘*After having sneezed*,’—after having done *sneezing*, which is the
name given to the sound that emanates involuntarily from the nostrils of
a man moved by internal wind.

‘*Even though he may be quite pure*.’—This is to be construed only with
the phrase^(‘)*when going to read the Veda*’; the meaning being that
even though he be quite pure, he should, when going to read the Veda,
read it after having sipped water; *i.e*., the water sipping-should be
done as part of the procedure laid down in connection with Vedic study;
while after *sleep* &c., the water-sipping shall be done *once* only.

As for the following declaration—^(‘)Having slept, having sneezed,
having eaten, having drunk water, the wise man shall sip water and then
again sip water; as also after having spat and told lies’,—this has to
be construed to mean that ‘having sipped water, he should eat and then
sip water again.’ In a case however where it is clearly stated that ‘one
should sip water *twice*, the act has to be repeated consecutively.’
