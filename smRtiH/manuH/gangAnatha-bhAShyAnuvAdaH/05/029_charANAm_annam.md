courageous and active; *e.g*. the kite, the mongoose and the rest.—Of
those the ‘*immobile*’—lethargic animals, such as the pigeon, the
serpent and the like—are ‘*the food*.’

Similarly ‘*of those endowed* *with* *fangs*,’—*i.e*. of the lion, the
tiger, etc.,—‘*those devoid of* *fangs*’—the *Ruru*, the *Pṛṣat* and the
other kinds of deer—arc the ‘*food*.’

‘*Those without hands*, serpents, fish and the like—are the food of
‘*those with hands*,’—of the mongoose and the fisherman, etc.

‘*Of* *the brave*’—of those that are endowed with great
courage—‘*cowards*’—those who are over-fond of life—are the food.

food—(29).
