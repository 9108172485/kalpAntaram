The impurity of the bodily excretions having been asserted in 131, the
present verse proceeds to lay down directions for their cleansing.

‘*Ejectors of urine and faeces*’—*i.e*., the. organs by which these are
passed,—*i*. *e*. the Anus &c.;—for the cleansing of these—one should
‘*use earth and water*, *as much as may be necessary*’; *i*. *e*. not
minding any restrictions as to the number (of washings and rubbings),
one should go on taking up as much water and earth as may be necessary
for the total removal of smells and stains.

‘*Bodily*’—proceeding from the body,—‘*excretions*’—which are sources of
impurity. In connection with the purifications necessitated by these
also, earth and water are to be used as much as may be necessary. In
another *Smṛti* we read—‘In the case of the former six excretions both
earth and water should be used; in the case of the latter six one is
purified even by the use of water only’.

In connection with phlegm &c. it is thus declared in another
*Smṛti*—‘The viscid excretion from the nose is called *Phlegm*’; and
since this occurs among the latter group of six, for cleansing it earth
need not be used at all.—(132).
