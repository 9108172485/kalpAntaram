^(‘)*Proper method*’—*i.e*., of worshipping the Gods and so forth; if
one does not eat meat, regardless of this manner, but eats it only in
the right manner,—^(‘)*he b* *ecomes popular*’—loved by the people: he
becomes dear to all.

‘He *is not afflicted by disease*.’—Diseases are produced if a man eats
the flesh of lean and enfeebled animals. For this reason also one should
eat meat only in the right manner; and by eating it thus, he ‘*is* *not
afflicted* *by* *disease*.’ By eating meat in any other way, he is
always afflicted by disease.

‘*Like a fiend*.’—The term ‘fiend’ stands for a species of lower
animals, which eat flesh always in the wrong manner; hence every one who
eats it in the wrong manner becomes like a fiend;—this is the sense of
the deprecatory simile.—(50).
