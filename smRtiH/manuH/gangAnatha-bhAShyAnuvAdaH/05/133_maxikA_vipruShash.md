‘*Flies*’.—all sweat-born insects.

The ‘*cow*’ includes the goat and sheep.

The ‘*horse*’ includes the elephant and the mule.

The ‘*sun*’ includes all luminous bodies.

‘*Vipruṣaḥ*’, ‘*water-drops*’—such drops of water as are invisible and
can be felt only by touch.

‘*Shadow*’—of the *Cāṇḍāla* and other unclean things.

‘*Earth*’—in contact with, or walked over by, the Cāṇḍāla and the
like—is pure. In other cases its sweeping has been prescribed.

The flies &c. mentioned here, even though coming into contact with
ordure and other unclean things, do net become sources of defilement.

Another Smṛti-text says—‘Goats and horses are pure in their mouths; cows
are pure except in their mouths; cats and mongoose are touchable,—as
also other auspicious birds and animals’.—(131).
