‘*For all the four castes*’.—This is meant to imply that the duties of
the *Śūdra*, generally laid down only in a vague form, could not be
known without special effort.

‘*Pretaśuddhi*’,—the purification of the living after the death of other
persons. This compound is according to the general rule ‘A noun with a
declensional ending is compounded with anther noun with a declensional
ending’.

Though the author announces that he is going to describe the
*purification*, yet, in as much ‘purification is dependent upon, and
relative to, ‘impurity’, and us it is the function of the treatise to
provide information regarding both, the author is going to describe
first the occasions of ‘Impurity’.—(57).
