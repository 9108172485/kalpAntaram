In the preceding verse—‘the dog is pure in the catching of deer’—all
that was meant was that in the act of catching deer, the dog is pure;
while the present verse goes into further details and declares the
purity of what has been killed by the dog, as also of that killed by
others with the stroke of sticks &c. Hence it is only the latter part of
the verse that lays down something new.

‘*Carnivorous animals*’—the kite, the jackal and the rest.

‘*Cāṇḍāla and others*’;—‘and others’ is meant to include the *Śvāpada*
and people of that class.

‘*Low castes*’—the *Nisāda*, the *Vyādha* and others, who live by
killing animals.—(129).
