In connection with food fit to be eaten, the Text proceeds to sanction
the act of killing.

If one’s dependents are very much pressed by hunger, and no other food
can be found, then one may kill such birds and beasts as are fit to be
eaten. The exact meaning of the term ‘dependent’ has been explained
before (as standing for parents, wife etc.)

The mention of Agastya—that Agastya did the act—is only by way of
recommendation.

The first half of the verse is purely commendatory; because the act of
killing in connection with sarcifices is directly enjoined by the Vedic
injunctions themselves (and as such does not stand in need of any
sanction from the present text).

‘*Commanded*’—*i.e*., permitted as lit to be eaten.

This same thing is slated in the next verse in greater detail, as
bearing upon the recommendation of certain acts.—(22).
