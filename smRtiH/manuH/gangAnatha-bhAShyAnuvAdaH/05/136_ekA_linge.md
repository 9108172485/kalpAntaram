After the passing of urine and faeces, for the cleansing of the urinary
organ, earth should be applied to it once.

In another *Smṛti* it has been laid down that one should take as much
earth mixed with water as can be contained in one hand. What I assert is
that in view of what has been said regarding the using of as much earth
and water as may be necessary, the proper quantity would be what is
stated in the present text. Some people quote, in this connection, the
following saying—‘The hand bring filled up, the first (and largest)
measure of it is called *Prasṛti*, the second is half of it; and the
third part of it is called *mṛttikā*.’ But this measure applies to the
case of anus-cleansing only. In all other cases, as much is to be used
as may be necessary.

In the case of a single evacuation also, the number of applications is
to be as here prescribed; and what is prescribed is the repetition of
the act (of rubbing and washing).

There is a distinction among the various kinds of ‘earth’, just as there
is among the various kinds of the ‘cow’ and other things. In present
connection, for instance, it has been declared that ‘earth should be got
from a place far removed from an ant-hill, us also from the stables’ and
so forth. No account need be taken however of the distinction into
‘white’, ‘black’, ‘red’ and so forth.

‘*Who desires*’—who wishes.—(134).
