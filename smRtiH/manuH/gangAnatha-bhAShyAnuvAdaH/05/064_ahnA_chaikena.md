‘*Three three-day periods*’— *i.e*., nine days;—along with one day and
one night,—make up *ten days*. The period has been mentioned in this
fashion in view of metrical exigencies.

‘*Those who touch the corpse*’—*i.e*., those who wash and adorn the dead
body. Mere bathing is going to be laid down later on, for the other
persons touching the body, as also for those who carry it; as will be
made dear from the next verse.

All this refers to the *Samānodaka* relations as also to those who carry
the body for wages received. In regard to the carrying of the dead of
helpless and forlorn persons, we have another *Smṛti*—text, which
says—‘For such persons who do the excellent deed (of carrying the dead
body of a helpless man), there is nothing wrong, nor is there any
impurity involved, for them it has been ordained that they are
immediately purified by bathing in water.’ As regards the assertion of
the text under 5.100—‘He who carries the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa, who is
not his Sapiṇḍa-relation, becomes purified in three days’—what this
means we shall explain under that verse.

‘*Those who offer water*’— *i.e*., the ‘*Samānodaka*’ relations. In
connection with these, ‘immediate purification’ also is going to be laid
down under verse 77. Hence the two should be regarded as optional
alternatives.

What is said here is in connection with ‘sapiṇḍa’ relations and refers
to persons not engaged in Vedic study.—(63)
