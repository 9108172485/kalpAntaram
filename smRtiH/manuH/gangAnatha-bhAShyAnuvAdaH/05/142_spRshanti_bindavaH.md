‘*Helping others to wash*,’—*i.e*. offering water to other persons.

The meaning is as follows When one is pouring water for another person
and the latter begins to sip water, if drops of water flowing out from
between the fingers of that person happen to fall on the ground and
rising from it, touch the feet of the man who is offering the
water,—that man is not made impure by them.

‘*Those on the ground*’.—The drops of water fulling from the hand of the
washing person, though unclean, should be regarded to be as clean as
small quantities of water collected on clean ground.

‘*By them*,’— touched, the man does not become impure.—(140)
