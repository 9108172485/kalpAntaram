The foetus grows in the womb, which is an unclean place: and it is
produced from semen and ovule, both unclean things.

‘*Fettering and killing*’—involved in the obtaining of meat.

‘*Having duly pondered over*’—carefully considered with an alert
mind;—‘*all* *this*,—*one shall abstain from the eating of all*
*meat*’—*i.e*., also of that which is not forbidden; what to say of what
is actually forbidden?

The present text is a commendatory exaggeration: it is not meant that
meat should be always regarded as *unclean*; the sentence does not mean
to lay down that all meat is actually unclean.—(49)
