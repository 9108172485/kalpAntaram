The eating of the meat of the Hare and other animals,—in the form of
remnants of the worship of Gods and Pitṛs—has been sanctioned. If one
abstains from this eating, he obtains the fruits of the *Aśvamedha*
sacrifice; and the fruits of this sacrifice have been described in the
words ‘he obtains all desires, etc., etc.’

In this connection it would not be right to urge the following
objection:—“How can mere abstaining from meat be equal to a sacrifice
involving tremendous labour and much expense?”—Because the said
abstention also is extremely difficult. Further, the principle
enunciated in the Sūtra.—‘The particular result would follow from
development as in the ordinary world’—is operative here also. Hence
there can be no objection against the asserting of results or fruits of
actions.

Our answer however is us follows:—What is said in the text is a purely
commendatory exaggeration; socially because the statement of the
sacrifice being performed ‘every year for one hundred years’ can be
regarded only us such an exaggeration; for it is not possible for the
*Aśvamedha* to be performed every year; nor can it be performed ‘for a
hundred years,’ as no performer would live so long,

‘*Puṇyaphalam*’ is a copulative compound, it being impossible to take it
us a Genitive *Tatpuruṣa*.—(53).
