‘*Unclean things*’.— Those just mentioned are to be understood as meant
here, because of their proximity.

Those *mantras* that are addressed to the Sun are called ‘*Solar*’ and
the mantras meant are ‘*udutyam jātavedasam*, &c. &c.’

The *Pāvamānī verses*.—*The* verses ‘*svādiṣṭaye*, &c. &c.’ occurring in
the ninth *maṇḍala* of the Ṛgveda.

‘*According to his inclination*’ and ‘*according to his capacity*’ mean
the same thing; two words have been used for the purposes of metre.

In as much as the ‘mantras’ and ‘verses’ are mentioned in the plural, at
least three verses should be recited; and as regards more, they may be
recited only if other and more important duties do not suffer thereby.
Then again, since the text speaks of ‘*mantras* and the term
‘*Pāramānī*’ also refers to *verses*, purification is brought about as
soon as one has gone beyond three verses, even though the hymn may not
be completed.

The *dog* also has to be included among the ‘*unclean things*’; as it
also is *unclean*. In the present context Gautama has declared—‘Of the
dog also; whatever it might pollute, say some’ (14.29-30).

‘*Attentively*’;—without allowing his mind to wander about; he should
fix it upon contemplating the deity. Or, ‘*Prayataḥ*’ may mean that ‘at
a time when one is busy with worshipping deities, if he should happen to
touch an unclean thing, he should do what is here laid down,—and not
otherwise’.—(85).
