‘*What he* *thinks of*’,—in the shape of profit and honour, &c.

‘*What he fixes his heart upon*’,—whatever desirable thing he has
longing for;—all this ‘*he obtains without effort*.’

‘*What he undertakes*’—whatever art he does, the reward of that he
obtains, without and difficulty, immediately after the accomplishment of
that act.—(47)
