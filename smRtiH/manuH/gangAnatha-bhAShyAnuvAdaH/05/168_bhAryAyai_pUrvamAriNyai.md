The present verse is added with a view to indicate the man’s title to
another marriage; *i.e*., an exception in favour of his wedding another
wife; and it also serves to prohibit the man forthwith taking to the
life of the Recluse or the Renunciate, as soon as he finds himself
deprived of his help-mate and this because he has still got to fulfil
certain duties. Says the *Śruti*—‘He is abandoned by old age, or by the
omission of his duties.’

Others say that a ‘*yadā*’, ‘when’, should be supplied in this verse; so
that there would be no incompatibility between this end the *Śruti*
laying down life-long *Āgnihotra*.—(166).
