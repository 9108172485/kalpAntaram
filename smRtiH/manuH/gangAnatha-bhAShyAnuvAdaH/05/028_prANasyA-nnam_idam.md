‘*Vital spirit*,’—‘the breath within the body, the very seed of life.
For the sustenance of this breath, as functioning in the fivefold form
of ‘*Udāna*’ and the rest,—and for its maintenance in the
body,—‘*Prajāpati created all this*’—world—as food.

Having indicated the world in a general way, by means of the pronoun
‘*this*’, the author proceeds to specify it in details—‘*all that is
movable or immovable*’. All this, on account of what is said in the
first half, is the ‘*food of the vital- spirit*’. The second ‘all’ is
not redundant, since it is added with a view to indicate the various
kinds of beings,—beasts, birds, men, reptiles, etc.

Since Prajāpati has ordained all this to be ‘food’ in times of distress,
all of it is the food of the vital spirit. This is also what we read in
the dialogue of the Vital Breath contained in the Upaniṣads—‘He
asked—what shall be my food?—Whatever exists, down to the dogs and down
to the insects and worms’—(28).
