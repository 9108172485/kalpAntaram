‘*According to suitability*’.—According to what may be suitable to a
particular thing; *i.e*., that substance should be used for cleaning
which is best fitted to remove the dirt from the object to be cleaned.
It is for this reason that in another *Smṛti* we find it stated
that—‘things made of tin and lead are to be cleansed by means of
cow-dung and chaff.’ Similarly—‘Brass-articles smelt by the cow, or
defiled by the food-leavings of the Śūdra, or defiled by dogs and cows
become cleansed by means of alkaline substances.’ It is with a view to
this that we have the various varieties of alkalines, such as those
prepared out of gruel, or of pomegranates and so forth.—(113).
