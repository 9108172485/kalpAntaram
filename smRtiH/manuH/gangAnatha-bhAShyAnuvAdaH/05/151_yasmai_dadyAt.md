‘*Or her brother with the father’s permission*’— Just as the brother is
entitled to give away the girl only with the father’s permission, so
also is the father entitled to give her away only with the consent of
her mother, though the present text speaks of the father as if he were
free to give her away without consulting anyone else. And the reason for
this lies in the fact that in all things the husband and wife have joint
title, and the daughter belongs to both the parents. In fact in
Discourse IX it is pointed oat that if the father is not alive, the girl
may be given away by the mother. The child is born of both parents, and
on this rests their right over her; hence it is only right that both
should consult each other.

‘*Attend upon*’—Serve.

‘*When he dead*, *she shall not disregard him*.’—‘Disregarding’ means
*not minding*. The meaning is that she should not behave as if she were
her own mistress; just as during her husband’s life-time she is
dependent upon him, so after his death also, she should ever remain
subservient to him. Since it has been declared that—‘the fact that she
has been given away constitutes the ground of his ownership over
her’,—as soon as the father gives away his daughter, his ownership over
her ceases, and then comes into existence the ownership of the man to
whom she is given away. This ‘giving away’ happens not only at the time
of marriage, but even at the time at which the bridegroom is chosen.

“For what purpose then is the *marriage* performed?”

\[The answer is given in the next verse.\]
