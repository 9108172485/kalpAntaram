Having ‘*passed*’—*i.e*., cleansed away according to the aforesaid
directions,—all taint of urine &c., from the urinary organ, etc.;—‘*and
sipped water*,’—‘*one should touch with water the cavities*’.

‘*Also when he may be going to read the Veda*’—*i.e*., according to the
course of Vedic study preserved in Discourse II.

In accordance with its primary signification, the word ‘*kṛtvā*’,
‘*having passed* appears to mean ‘having evacuated’; and the meaning is
that—‘after having passed urine and faeces and washed the anus and the
urinary organ, one should sip water’.

‘*Also when going to read the Veda*;’—the sipping of water has been
prescribed as a necessary duty in connection with the course of Vedic
study, under 2.70. What is prescribed here is meant for all sorts of
reading of the Veda—either by one who is *teaching* it, or *reading* it.
In other cases, people are said to be ‘reciting’ the Veda
(*udaharantaḥ*). The meaning is that after having done other secular
acts, one should not pronounce the words of the Veda, without having
sipped water.

‘*Also when going to take food*.’ (136).
