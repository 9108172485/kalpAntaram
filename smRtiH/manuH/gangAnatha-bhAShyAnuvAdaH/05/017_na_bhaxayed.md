‘*Solitary*’—those animals that move about singly (not in herds); such
as serpents, owls and the like.

‘*Unknown*’—as regards *name* and *kind*.

‘*Beasts and birds*;’—neither beasts nor birds are fit to be taken.

‘*Even though indicated among those fit to be eaten*’—Those that are not
actually forbidden are, to that extent, regarded as fit to be eaten; and
hence indirectly ‘indicated’ as such. In reality, there is no direct
indication of those fit to be eaten. Those that are not specially
recognised as to be avoided come to be regarded as fit to be eaten; and
these are spoken of as ‘*indicated as fit to be eaten*’.

‘*Fire-nailed animals*:’—*e.g*. the Monkey, the Jackal and the like.

‘*Any*’—has been added for filling up the metre.—(17)
