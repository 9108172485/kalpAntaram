*Sprinkling*—with cow’s urine or water; or by milk, as laid down in some
books.

‘*Scraping*.’—Scratching with some weapon and then throwing away the
scraped earth, according to Gautama’s direction that ‘of land there
should be throwing away’ (1.32).

‘*By these five*.’—This re-iteration is with a view to indicate that the
methods may be used singly or collectively. ‘*Smearing* without
‘*cleaning*’, is a means of purifying a spot which is not supplied with
a dust-inn. If the ground is stained with urine or ordure, there should
be *scraping* and *sweeping*. In the case of river-banks and forests,
there should be sprinkling with water.

‘*Lodging of cows*’—making the land a cow-pen for a single day.

All this should be done in the case of land lying near the
cremation-ground. In the case of land containing bones and skull, a
portion of the earth should be taken out and thrown away to another
place; also where all these may not be visible, but where their
existence and subsequent appearance may be suspected.—(122).
