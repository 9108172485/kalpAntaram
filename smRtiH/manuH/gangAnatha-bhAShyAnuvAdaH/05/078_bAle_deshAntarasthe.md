‘*Child*’—*i.e*., a son that has not yet teethed;—‘*resident in a
foreign country*’—*who is a non-sapiṇḍa relation*’—‘*dying*’,—all these
terms are in apposition.

‘*Non-Sapiṇḍa*’—*i.e*., *Samānodaka*.

When such a person dies while residing in a foreign country, the
purification is ‘immediate.’

When such a person dies near at hand, then the purification comes sifter
‘three days’—as declared in verse 63 above—(77).
