Though the terra ‘*rājan*’, ‘king’, is denotative of the
*Kṣatriya-caste*, yet, on account of the reason being stated in the
words that ‘they occupy the position of sovereigns’, it follows that it
indicates the ruler of countries. This we shall explain fully under the
next verse.

‘*Those who are keeping a vow*;’—*i.e*., those who are observing a vow,
and undergoing such penances as those of the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ and the
like.

‘*Performers of sacrificial sessions*;’—*i.e*., those who are performing
the ‘*Gavāmayana*’ sacrifice, or those who have been initiated for the
other sacrifices also. Says Gautama (14.1)—‘For sacrificial priests, for
one who has been initiated and for the Student.’

In support of this we have the laudatory statement (in the second line).
‘*Position of Sovereigns*;’—*i.e*., the kings—‘*occupy*,’—maintain,—The
‘*position*’—place—‘*of* *sovereigns*’—of rulers of men; and the other
two—the keepers of vows and performers of sacrificial sessions—have
attained the character of Brahman.

‘*Taint of uncleanliness*’— *i.e*., impurity.

Others have explained the term ‘*Sattriṇaḥ*’ to mean persons who are
constantly making gifts. But in its primary denotation, the term refers
to a particular form of sacrifice.—(92).
