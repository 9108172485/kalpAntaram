*Objection*—“When the question has been put forward in regard to
Brāhmaṇas *who perform their duties*, it is not right to answer it by
indicating the ‘fault’; nor can there be any connection with what
follows (in verse 4) \[as omission of Vedic Study &c. is not possible
for those who perform their duties\].”

The answer to the above is as follows:—‘Omission of Vedic Study’ and the
rest have been put forward only by way of illustration; the sense
being—‘just as the omission of Vedic Study and the rest are acknowledged
by you all to be the causes of death, so also are the defects of food,
going to be described below. Even when a man carries on Vedic Study &c.,
the fulfilment of his above-described duty is not complete, if it is
beset with the very much more serious drawback of defective food. This
is emphasised here in view of the fact that this is an entirely
different section (dealing with defects of food). (3-4)
