These two verses are to be taken as citing examples in illustration of
what has been laid down in the *Śruti*.

When the cups, the spoons and other sacrificial vessels have been used
in one performance, they become smeared with clarified butter and other
offering-materials employed at that performance; and with a view to
avoid the contamination of the fresh performance by such stains and
smearings, these have to be removed by means of hot water; and this
cleansing has to be done in the manner prescribed for each case:
sometimes by hand, sometimes by kuśa-grass, sometimes by the threads at
the end of one’s garment, and so on.

The purification here mentioned is in connection with sacrificial
performances; in the event of the vessels becoming defiled with
food-leavings etc., the cleaning is to be done in the same manner as in
the case of ordinary vessels. In as much as we have the Vedic
declaration—‘they do not become unclean by Soma’.—it is understood that
in the case of other defilements, the ordinary purification is to be
done.

The exact shapes of the ‘*graha*’ the ‘*chamasa*’ and the ‘*sphya*’ are
to be ascertained from persons versed in sacrificial lore.—(115-116).
