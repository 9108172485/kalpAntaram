The mouth of all women is ‘*pure*’— for the purposes of kissing &c.
‘Women during sexual intercourse etc.’—says another *Smṛti* -text. What
is said here applies only to such women with whom sexual intercourse is
possible, and not to the mother, sister and such women. This should not
be understood to be the denial of the impurity attaching to the mouth
until it is washed after food. Because even though the wife is a woman
with whom sexual intercourse is possible, yet it has been declared in
discourse IV that ‘one should not eat with his wife’.

The addition of the term ‘*always*’ implies that the mouth is pure, not
only at the time of the actual intercourse, but also during the acts
that lead up to it.

‘*The bird in the dropping of fruits*’.— Though the term “*śakuni*’,
‘*bird*’, denotes all kinds of birds, yet by usage, what is said here is
not applicable to the crow, the vulture or other such birds as feed upon
unclean things.

Since the text uses the term ‘*dropping*’, the present rule applies only
to fruits on the tree.

‘*In causing the flow*’.—*When* the cow is being milked, the calf is
made to touch the teats for the purpose of making the milk to flow; and
yet it has been declared that ‘cows are pure except in their mouths’; so
that the touch of the calf’s mouth might be regarded as a source of
impurity; it is with a view to preclude this notion that we have the
present text.

The dog itself is not pure; but it is to be regarded as pure when in the
course of hunting, it catches’the deer—(128).
