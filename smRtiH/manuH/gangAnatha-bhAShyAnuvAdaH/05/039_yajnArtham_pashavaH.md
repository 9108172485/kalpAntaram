The evil just described does not pertain to the killing of animals at
the rites prescribed by *Śruti* and S *mṛti*.

That ‘killing’ which forms part of sacrifices,—for the due fulfilment of
that were animals ‘*created*’—produced, brought into existence,—‘*by the
self-born God*’—Prajāpati ‘*himself*.’

This is a purely commendatory passage.

‘*Sacrifice*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest—‘*is
conducive to the well-being*’—prosperity, development, advancement —‘*of
all this*’— world.

For this reason the killing that is done at a sacrifice should be
regarded as no killing at all. What this means is that it does not
involve the sin of ‘killing’ animals.—(39)
