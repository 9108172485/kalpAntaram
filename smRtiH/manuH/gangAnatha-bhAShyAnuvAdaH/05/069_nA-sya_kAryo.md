‘*Like a log of wood*;’—this signifies absence of attachment,
indifference.

The morning is that in thin case no *Śrāddha*, nor any water, is to be
offered; the prohibition of ‘water-offering’ implying that of the
*Śrāddha* also, through the relation of whole and part. It is thus that
we have to get at the omission of *Śrāddha*, which is in accordance with
usage.

Others explain this to mean the prohibition of burial laid down in other
*Smṛti* -texts. And in this case there would be option.

‘*Keep aloof*’—abstain from all religious acts prescribed in the
scriptures.—(68)
