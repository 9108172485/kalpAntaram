‘*Like* *a relative*’,—*i.e*., from a religious motive, and not on
payment of wages.

‘*Near relatives of his mother*’:— the term ‘near’ is meant to include
such close relations as the maternal uncle and the like. From this it
appears that the term ‘*non-sapiṇḍa*’ here stands for those who are not
‘*samānodaka*’,—and not only for all except *sapiṇḍa* -relations.—(100).
