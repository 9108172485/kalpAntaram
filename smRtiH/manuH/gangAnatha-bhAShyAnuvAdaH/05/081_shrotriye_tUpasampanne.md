‘*Learned*’—Who has studied the Vedic text.

‘*Companion*’—who, through friendship, has been living with one. Or
‘*upasampanna*’ may mean *endowed with good character*.

What has been said before (Verse 70) regarding the case of
‘fellow-students’ pertains to those who have not yet got up the entire
Veda.

In lexicons the term ‘*upasampanna*’ appears as a synonym for ‘dead’;
but in view of the long period of impurity laid down (which would not be
compatible with the case of a *stranger*), the former explanation is the
better of the two.

Others construe the text otherwise—explaining it to mean that ‘the
impurity lasts for three clays in the case of the *learned maternal
uncle*’ and ‘for a night along with the two days in the case of the
pupil, etc.’

The term ‘*relation*’ stands for the wife’s brother, the son of the
maternal aunt and so forth.

When we connect the ‘maternal uncle’ with^(‘)the night along with the
two days’,—then, since this period would be already applicable to the
case of the maternal uncle by reason of his being a ‘*relation*’, the
separate mention of him should he taken as making the rule compulsory in
his case; and this would mean that in the case of other *relations*, it
would be discretionary.—(80)
