‘*Pāṭhīna*’ and ‘*Rohita*’—two particulars kinds of fish-having been
mentioned as fit to be offered to Gods and to Pitṛs, the eating of these
is permitted on the occasion of the performance of *Śrāddha* and other
rites; and not in the course of ordinary daily food. As for the
*Rājīva*, the ‘*Siṃhatuṇḍa*’ and the ‘*Saśalka*’ fish on the other hand,
these are to be eaten ‘*on all occasions*’; *i.e*. they may be eaten
also on occasions other than the offerings to Gods and to Pitṛs.

‘*Rājīva*’ some people regard this as standing for lotus-coloured fish.
Others explain it as standing for those fish that are marked by lines.

‘*Siṃhatuṇḍa*,’—those having a lion-like face.

‘*Saśalka*’—is the same as the fish called ‘*Shakalin*.’—(16).
