‘*Have carried*’—have taken out.

‘*While his own people are there*’—*i.e*., men of the same caste. The
use of the term ‘*oblation into fire*’ implies that the body should not
also be burnt by the *Śūdra*.

The specification of the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is not emphasised; for the
*Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also the Śūdra’s touch is defiling; hence
what the supplementary statement indicates is that the prohibition
applies to the case of these two also.—(103).
