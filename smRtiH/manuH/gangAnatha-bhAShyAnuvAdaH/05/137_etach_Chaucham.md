The rules regarding Purification vary with the stages of life. For those
who do not belong to any of these stages, the only rule is that as much
earth and water shall be used as may be necessary. The same holds good
for the *Śūdra* also, who is entitled to observe the rules regarding the
stage of the Householder; so that he also has to observe the same number
of applications.—(135).
