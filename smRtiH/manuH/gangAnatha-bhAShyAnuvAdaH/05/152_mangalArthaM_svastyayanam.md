‘*Good fortune*’ consists in the accomplishment of the desired object;
what brings about this is said to be ‘for that purpose;’ it is for this
that there is ‘sacrifice to Prajāpati.’ The term ‘*maṅgalārtham*’ is in
the neuter form, because it is an adverb.

‘*Svastyayanam*’ is that by which ‘*svasti*’, *welfare*—‘*īyate*’,—*is
secured*; *i.e*. whereby the person’s loved objects do not become lost.

‘*Their*’—of women.

‘*At wedding*’, ‘sacrifice’ is offered to the deity Prajāpati. This
refers to certain offerings of butter that are presented as to be made
at marriage with the *mantras ‘Prajāpate* &c.’ This is only
illustrative: it indicates the other deities also—*e.g*. Pūṣan, Varuṇa
and Aryaman. Indicative also of these other deities are such
mantra-texts as —‘*Puṣannu devam varuṇanna devam*, &c., &c.’

What, the present text, means is that even without the marriage,
ownership is produced by the *giving away*; and no significance is meant
to be attached to the statement that the marriage-sacrifices are
performed only for the purpose of securing good fortune; because
‘marriage’ has been declared to consist in the ‘taking of a wife’; and
even though there may be ownership, the girl does not become ‘wife’
until the marriage is performed.—(150).
