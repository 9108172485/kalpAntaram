“*Capture*” and ‘*death*’ are the ‘*sufferings*’ meant; or ‘*sufferings’
may* be taken separately, as standing for ‘doing pecuniary harm’ etc.

He who *seeks* to do all this ,—*i.e*., who not only desists from such
acts, but who never has any desire to do it;—such a person does not
merely cense, to do harm to others, he actually becomes their
‘*well-wisher*’,—he is anxious to do good to them; and ‘*he obtains
perfect* *happiness*’— (46).
