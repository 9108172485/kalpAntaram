‘Vomitting’ and ‘purging’ are well known. The man who throws out the
food that he has eaten is said to have ‘*vomitted*’. The man the number
of whose motions has gone beyond the number *eight*,— either through
disease, or through his having taken *Harītakī* or some such
purgative—is said to have ‘*purged*.’

These two persons should first of all bathe.

Then, they should eat clarified butter and then any other kind of food;
and the injunction of eating clarified batter is meant to be a
prohibition of other kinds of food. Just as in the case of expiatory
rites, ashes and water are regarded as means of purification, so in the
case in question, is the eating of clarified butter.

‘*After having taken food he should only sip water*’— After he has taken
his food, if he happen to vomit or purge on the same day, then he should
do the sipping of water only, and not. bathing and eating of clarified
butter.

Others have taken this independently by itself, to mean that ‘after
having taken his food he should sip water this being a reiteration of
the water-sipping that has already been prescribed as to be done after
meals.

‘*One who has copulated*,’—*i.e*., one who has had sexual intercourse
with a woman,—becomes pure by bathing. (142).
