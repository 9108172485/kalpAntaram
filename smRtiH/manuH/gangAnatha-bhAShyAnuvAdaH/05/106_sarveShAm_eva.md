“What is the connection of this in the present context?”

What is meant is that—‘just as one who, after having paid the of nature,
immediately betakes to purifying himself by day and water,—so whenever,
through carelessness and mistake, one happens to steal what belongs to
others, or to do any such act,—he should immediately betake to the
necessary expiatory rites, for the purpose of purifying himself’;—as is
going to be explained under Discourse 11.—(105).
