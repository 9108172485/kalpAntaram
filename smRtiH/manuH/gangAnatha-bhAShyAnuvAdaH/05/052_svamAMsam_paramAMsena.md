This deprecates the man who eats meat for the purposc of fattening
himself, and not one who does it for averting disease. That this is so
is clear from the words of the text ‘*he who seeks to increase*.’ In him
also, only if he does it ‘*without worshipping the Gods and Pitṛs*.’ But
if the man is ill, and recovery is not possible without eating meat,
then there would be no harm, even if the said worshipping were not
done.—(52).
