This is a commendatory supplement to the foregoing prohibition of fish.

When one eats the flesh of an animal, he comes to be described as
connected with the act of eating that animal; *e.g*., the mungoose is
called ‘serpent-eater’, the cat ‘rat-eater’ and so forth. He who eats
fish eats all kinds of flesh; it would be right to speak of him as a
‘beef-eater’ also.

Hence, by reason of the possibility of this calumny, one should avoid
fish.—(15).
