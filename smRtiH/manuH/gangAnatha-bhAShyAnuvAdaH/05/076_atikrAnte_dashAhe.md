In cases where the period of impurity ordained lasts for ten days or
more,—if this period has elapsed, the impurity shall last for three
days. But in cases where the period ordained lasts for three days, or
one day, or less,—if this period has elapsed, one has simply to bathe
along with his clothes: as is going to be laid down later—(Verse 77.)

‘*When a year has elapsed*’—one becomes pure ‘*by touching
water*’,—*i.e*., by bathing. From what has been said elsewhere regarding
‘touching water with the hands and feet &c.’, it is clear that the whole
body is to touch water: and this is what constitutes ‘bathing’.—(75).
