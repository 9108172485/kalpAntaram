‘*Salines and salts*.’—The term^(‘)*salines*’ stands for nitrate of
potash and such substances, and^(‘)*salts*’ for rock-salt and other
salts. These they should not eat.

Or, the term ‘*saline*’, ‘*kṣāra*’, may be taken as qualifying,
‘*lavaṇa*’, ‘salt.’ In that case the prohibition (applying to only
*saline salts*) would not apply to rock-salt.

The ‘bathing’ laid down is to be done in a river or a tank or such other
reservoirs of water as are not regarded as specially ‘sacred’; and it is
to be done without scrubbing the body.

‘*Meat-food*’—is prohibited during the period of impurity, on the basis
of other *Smṛti* texts; where we read—‘They shall not have recourse to
women, they shall not scrub their body and they shall not eat meat.’ The
*Gṛhyasūtra* however says—‘For three days they shall remain without
food, or still live upon food obtained by purchase.’

‘*Should sleep*’—upon the bare platform, without company.

Another Smṛti-text has prescribed abstention from sexual intercourse
during impurity due to *births* also.—(72).
