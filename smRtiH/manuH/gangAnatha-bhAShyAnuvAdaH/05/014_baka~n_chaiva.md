The prohibition of the ‘*Baku, Balākā and* *Kākola*’ being already
included under that of ‘fish-eaters’, these have been mentioned
separately in order to indicate that the eating of the other fish-eating
birds is optional.

‘*Fish-eaters*’.—Animals other than birds also, which eat fish, are to
be regarded as ‘unfit to be eaten’; such animals, for instance, as the
alligator and the like; that this is what is meant, is clear from the
fact that the name ‘*fish-eater*’ is to be applied in its literal sense.

*Kākola* is the same as the Kite, such being its name in foreign lands;
for instance, it is known by this name in the *Bāhlīka* country.

The prohibition of the ‘*village-pig*’ implies the permission to eat the
wild pig. The prohibition of those ‘living in villages’ in the preceding
verse (11) should be taken, on the strength of the context, us referring
to *birds* only. It is only thus that there would be any point in the
mention of the ‘village-pig’ in the present verse. The pig that lives in
villages is called ‘*viḍvarāha*’, ‘*village-pig*.’

“If in verse 11, ‘those living in villages’ are to be taken, on the
strength of the context, as *birds* only, then the term ‘fish-eaters’ in
the present verse also should be taken as referring to *birds* only.”

Not so; because the present context is not restricted to *birds* only;
since it mentions also non-birds, such as the ‘village pig’ and‘fish.’

‘*Sarvaśaḥ*,’— always.

This is a general rule; its exceptions we shall explain later on.—(14).
