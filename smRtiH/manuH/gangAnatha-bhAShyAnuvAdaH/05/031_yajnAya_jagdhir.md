‘*The eating of meat*—in the form of offerings and oblations —‘*for
sacrifices*.’

‘*This* *is* *the div* *ine law*’;—this is what has been ordained by the
Gods.

‘*Behaviour contrary to this*,’—*i.e*. eating meat for the fattening of
the body—is ‘*the* *demonical pract* *ice*’; it is only demons that eat
meat in this fashion. This is said in deprecation of the practice.—(31)
