‘*Ādiṣṭa*’ means ‘*ādeśa*’, ‘instruction’; and the term ‘*person under
instruction*’ denotes the *Student*, by reason of his connection with
the instruction that he receives regarding his observances. The present
text prohibits the making of water-offerings by one who is still in the
state of the Student, to such *Sapiṇḍa* relations as may happen to die
*during that period*. As for those that have died before, the offering
of water to the forefathers and Gods has already been prescribed for the
Student also.

‘*Till the completion of his pupilage*;—*i.e*. till the performance of
the ‘*Samāvartana*’ ceremony; and it does not mean any forced completion
of the stage in the interval.

On returning after having finished his observances, he shall make a
water-offering to each of the dead relations on one day; and he should
observe ‘impurity’ for three days.

As regards the making of water-offering to his mother, this is necessary
for the Student also; and such an offering does not interfere with the
proper fulfilment of his observances. In support of this they quote
another *Smṛti* -text—*viz*. ‘The person undergoing instruction does not
commit a wrong in making a water-offering.’—(87).
