‘*Ḍimba*’, ‘*Riot*’, is fighting done by many people, without weapons;
‘*Āhava*’ is battle.

In the case of persons killed in these, there is immediate purification.

‘*Lightning*’—This has been already explained.

‘*Pārthiva*’—the lord of the Earth, who may belong to any of the four
castes.

Also in the case of one who, even apart from battle, has been killed in
water, or by tusked animals,—for the sake of cows and *Brāhmaṇas*.

‘*Also for the person for whom the King desires it*;’—*i.e*. the person
who has been deputed by him to do a definite work.

*Question*:—“Why should this be so? In the case of the king himself,
immediate purification has been ordained only in reference to his work
of protecting the people; how then could the impurity of any and every
person, without any restriction, cease merely by the king’s desire?”

\[The answer to this is supplied by the next two verses\].—(94).
