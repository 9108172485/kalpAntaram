After the completion of the prescribed period of impurity—of ten days,
&c.—there is something more that has got to be done.

‘*Touching Water*’ stands for *bathing*, as we have already explained
before.

‘*After he* *has* *performed the rite*.’—This goes with the *Kṣatriya*
and the other two that follow; and the ‘rite’ meant is only *bathing*,
none other being found to have been prescribed. The meaning thus is
that, ‘having bathed, they should touch the conveyance and other
things.’

Others however explain the term ‘*rite*’ as standing for the *Śrāddha
ceremonies*; the meaning being that all become pure after having
performed the *Śrāddha-ceremonies*, but the *Brāhmaṇa* after he has
‘touched water’, and the *Kṣatriya* and the rest after touching the
conveyance and other things.—(98).
