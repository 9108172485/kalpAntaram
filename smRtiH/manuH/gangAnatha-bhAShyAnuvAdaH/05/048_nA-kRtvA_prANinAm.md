This verse show’s that all the verses forbidding the killing of animals
are auxiliary to the prohibition of meat-eating.

As a matter of fact, until animals have been killed, meat cannot be
obtained; and killing is very painful. Hence one should avoid meat.

“Meat can be obtained from animals that die of themselves; how is it
then that it is said that it cannot be obtained *without encompassing
the death of animals*?”

The verse is a purely commendatory exaggeration. Further, there can be
no idea of any one eating the meat of animals dying of themselves, for
the simple reason that such meat is the source of disease. Meat is never
eaten without being offered, and what is a source of disease can never
be offered as gift.

‘*Utpadyate*’;—the meat is brought about by *killing*; hence the
nominative of *hilling* and of *obtaining* may be regarded as one and
the same; so that there is nothing incongruous in the expression
‘*nākṛtvā utpadyate*’. Or, ‘*utpadyate*’ may be construed along with
‘*does not lead to Heaven*.’ What is meant is, not only that it does not
lead to heaven, but also that it leads to hell and other evils.—(48)
