‘*Foreign country*,’—means *another village*, &c., as before.

‘*Vigatam*’—dead.

‘*Within ten days*’.—This is only by way of illustration: what is meant
is the period of impurity that has been prescribed in each case;—the
remainder of that period would be the period to be observed in the
special case mentioned. The repeated mention of ‘*ten days*’ is for the
purpose of filling up the metre.

The period of impurity due to birth and death is determined by their
origin; so that the periods of ‘ten days’ and the rest are to be counted
from the day on which the birth or the death may have taken place, and
not from the day on which it may become known to the relations. As a
result of this, if the guest happen to know of the birth, &c., having
occurred in the house, he should not take his food in that house, even
though the master of that house himself may still be ignorant of it.
Thus in both cases (of death and birth) the counting is to be done from
the day of origination.

Thus those who are subject to impurity for ‘ten days’ shall remain
impure for the remainder of that period; and for those who are subject
to a period of ‘three days’, purification is obtained immediately, by
bathing along with all the clothing that may be on them.—(74).
