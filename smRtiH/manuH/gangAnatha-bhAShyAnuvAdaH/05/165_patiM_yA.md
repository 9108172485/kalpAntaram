These verses sum up the duties of women; and these duties are easily
intelligible; hence I have devoted no attention to the explanation of
these.

The meaning of the teaching is as follows:—Though the man is permitted
(in 167) to take to another wife, yet that does not permit of the woman
taking another husband; because according to the injunction—‘she shall
not disregard him when he is dead’, there can be no possibility of her
marrying again; and by the assertion that ‘even childless persons go to
heaven’ it is made clear that the bearing of children, even in times of
distress, is forbidden. It is only in the *Smṛti* sanctioning ‘*Niyoga*’
that this latter is permitted. Hence in view of these (prohibition and
sanction) the two courses are regarded as optional alternatives; and
between these two *Smṛtis* we cannot determine which is superior and
which inferior; since one of them enjoins the bearing of children, and
the other clearly forbids it. Hence by taking them as optional
alternatives we make room for both—(163-164).
