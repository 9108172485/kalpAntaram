The ‘ground’ is mentioned only by way of illustration; so that water in
canals is also pure. Water on the ground, as also in the atmosphere, is,
by its very nature, pure; but the ground, being in contact with unclean
substances, is slightly impure; hence when water is collected on the
ground, it imbibes impurity by contact; and the present text proceeds to
point out what quantity of water thus collected is to be regarded as
*pure*:—‘*Sufficient to* *allay the thirst of the cow*’;—‘*vaitṛṣṇyam*’
means *freedom* *from* *thirst*, This is meant to indicate a particular
quantity; this explanation having been adopted by the ancients on the
strength of the words of the Veda—‘so that the dawlap of the cow dapples
in water &c. &c.’ Thus the quantity meant is that in which the cow’s
dewlap becomes submerged, or which allays her thirst.

Water collected on pure ground is pure, even in small quantities.

“How is it to be known that water has been ‘*contaminated by an unclean
thing*’?”

In answer to this we have the phrase—‘*becoming affected by its*
*smell*, *colour and taste*,’ The Instrumental ending in ‘*amedhyena*’,
‘*by* *an unclean thing*’, has to be changed here into the *genitive*;
the meaning being—‘when the water imbibes the smell, colour and taste
*of* *the unclean thing*, then it is to be regarded as *contaminated* by
it.’ According to this construction, if in a tank, an unclean thing be
found in one part, while in another part the water be found to be free
from its smell &c., then this latter is to be regarded as pure—(126).
