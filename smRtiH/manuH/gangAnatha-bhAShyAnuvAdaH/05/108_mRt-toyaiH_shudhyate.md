When the banks of a river with water shallowed down becomes defiled by
unclean things, its water becomes purified by the current of the same
river, when it has regained its current strong enough to demolish its
sides. The brinks of rivers are not purified in the manner in which
other ground is purified “by means of five things” (Verse 123).

Or, it may be that the text has declared that ‘the river is purified by
its current’ in view of the idea that people may have in regard to the
river having become defiled on account of un clean things flowing along
its current; and the meaning is that it should not be thought that,
inasmuch as the river has become contaminated by the flowing along of
unclean things coming from all sides, it can never, become pure.

The woman who has not been found to have had carnal intercourse with any
man, but continues to think of the beauty and good qualities of other
men, is regarded as ‘*of undean mind*’, and such a woman becomes
purified by ‘*menstruation*’; *i.e*.,; by the flow of blood during her
courses.

‘*Renunciation*’ shall be described in Discourse VI, and by this are
Brāhmaṇas purified. And no mere mental process removes the sin that
they, in their ignorance, may have committed in the shape of having
entertained thoughts for the killing of small insects and so
forth.—(107).
