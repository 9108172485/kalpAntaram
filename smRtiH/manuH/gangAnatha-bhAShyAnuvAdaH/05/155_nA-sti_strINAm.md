It has been more than once explained that women, separated from their
husbands are not entitled to the performance of sacrifices. From this it
follows that, when going to keep an observance or to take to a fast, she
should obtain his permission.

‘*Observance*’ here stands for the vow to give up meat, wine and such
things; it does not stand for the *Kṛcchra* and other penancce; because
the repeating of *mantras* and offering of libertions form part of these
latter, end to these the women is not entitled. It will not be right to
argue here that—“it would be possible for the woman to perform the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances, omitting the mantras and the libations”
because it can never be right to abandon, at one’s will, the details of
a sacrificial performance; specially as it is only the act complete in
all its details that is regarded as lending to prosperity and success.
Nor does the dropping or adding of details depend upon the varying
capacities of performers. Then again, a woman has always available men
of her own caste, among the three higher castes, who could perform for
her the mid acts. For these reasons neither the woman nor the *Śūdra*,
desiring her own welfare, is entitled to the performance of the
*Kṛcchra* and other penances. We shall explain this in detail under the
*Expiatory Rites*.

‘*Fasting*’—living without food, giving up eating for one day. two days
or such limited periods.

^(‘)*Serves*’—attends upon.—(153).
