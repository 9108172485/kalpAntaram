‘*Performance*’— doing.

‘*Are served*’—benefited.

Those handicrafts which are beneficial to the twice-born people (shall
be taken up by the Śūdra).

Though ‘*arts*’ also are the ‘*occupation of craftsmen*,’ yet, inasmuch
as the two have been separately mentioned, the ‘craftsmen’ meant here
should be taken as the carpenter, the wood-cutter and so forth, and
their occupations are *wood-cutting, carpentry* and the like.

‘*Arts*’— such as decorating, toilet, painting and so forth.—(100).
