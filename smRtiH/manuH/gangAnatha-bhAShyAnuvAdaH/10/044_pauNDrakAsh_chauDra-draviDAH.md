‘*Puṇḍra*’—and the rest originally stood as names of countries; but in
the present context they have been used according to the theory that
‘these names really denote the particular Kṣatriya castes, and are only
indirectly applied to countries inhabited by them.’

Pāṇini 4.2.69 lays down the adding of the ‘*aṇ*’ affix in the sense of
*habitation*, and Sūtra 4.2.81 lays down the elimination of this affix;
it is in accordance with this that we have the form ‘*Puṇḍra*’ (which is
formed of the term ‘*puṇḍra*’ with the ‘*aṇ*’ affix);—and the
elimination is not according to Pāṇini 1.2.54.

The assertion that these people have become ‘low-born’ is based upon the
fact that in these countries we do not meet with any dear division of
the ‘four castes.’

If however these terms be tried to be used irrespectively of the names
of countries, then they should be taken as the names of so many castes.

Some people might be led to think that all these races here named are
found to be described as *Kṣatriyas*, so that they must be Kṣatriyas
still. And it is with a view to preclude this idea that it is asserted
that *these are low-born*.

All the people here spoken of form the races inhabiting the borders of
Āryāvarta,—such races for instance, as the *Kirāta*, the ‘*Vena*’, the
‘*Darada*’ and so forth; and it is with reference to this that we have
the declaration that ‘one should not go to the borders’ (*Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad*, 1.3.10).—(44)
