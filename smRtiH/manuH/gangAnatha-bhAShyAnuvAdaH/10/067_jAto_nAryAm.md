‘*Woman*’—female.

‘*Non-Ārya*’—belonging to a low caste.

‘*To an Ārya*’—to one belonging to a high caste.

Such a person would be an *Ārya*.

“Does he actually become a Brāhmaṇa?”

No; he is an ‘*Ārya*’ only ‘*in quality*,’—only figuratively; *i.e*.,
only so far as being entitled to the performance of the *Pākayajña*
rites.

This person is called an ‘*Ārya*’ only in comparison with the person
going to be described in the latter half of the text.

‘*One* *born to a non-ārya*’—a Śūdra—‘*from an Ārya woman*’—a Brāhmaṇa
female—‘*is always non-ārya*’.

This is the decision.

The meaning of all this is that the pre-eminence of any mixed caste is
to be accepted only in accordance with what is distinctly stated in the
text, and no inferences should be drawn regarding this matter. Hence the
right course would always be that one should have intercourse with a
woman of the same caste as himself; and what is said regarding
the^(‘)soil’ being the important factor, pertains only to the case of
the^(‘)soil-born’ son, and not to any other cases.—(67)
