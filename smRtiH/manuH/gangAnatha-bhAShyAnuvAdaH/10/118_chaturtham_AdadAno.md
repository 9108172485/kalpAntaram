This verse permits the King’s receiving of the fourth part (of the
land-produce), instead of the *sixth* usually taken, when his treasury
has become depleted. The rest of it is purely declamatory.

‘*To the best of his ability*’—This is an adverb; the meaning being *to
the best of his power*.—(118)
