‘*Craftsmen*’— such as cooks, weavers, and the like; the occupations of
these are *cooking, weaving* and so forth. By these, ‘*he may subsist*.’

‘*Danger to wife and sons*’—*i.e*., incapability of maintaining them.

*Śūdra* these have been permitted only when all other property is lost
and the man is in dire distress.—(99)
