‘*Unknown*’—*i.e*., there being doubts regarding his parentage, known to

of their character,—they shall be recognised. That is, if a man is found
to be addicted to wicked acts, and of cruel disposition, and if his
parentage is doubtful, it should be concluded that he is of low birth,
born illegitimately.—(57)
