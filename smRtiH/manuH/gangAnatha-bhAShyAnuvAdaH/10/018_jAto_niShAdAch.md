**(verses 10.15-18)**

The ‘*Niṣāda*’ meant here is not the caste born from the Brāhmaṇa on the
Śūdra girl, which has been described above (Verse 8), but the child born
in the ‘inverse order,’ which is going to be mentioned later on. That
this must be so is clear from the fact that the present context deals
with ‘*inverse-born castes*;’ it being well-known that the ‘*Pukkasa*’
is a caste of this latter class.—(15- 18)
