‘*Dwelling*’—living place; this should be far removed from the village.

‘*Apapātra*,’—(*a*) Kept aloof; the vessels in which they have eaten
shall not be cleaned for further use; they shall be thrown away; with
the exception of gold and silver vessels, in connection with which
special methods of cleaning have been prescribed.

(*b*) Or, the term ‘*Apapātra*’ may mean that when cooked rice, fried
flour or some such food is given to them, they shall not be given in
vessels that are in contact with their body; the food shall be given
into the vessel lying on the ground, or held in the hand by some one
else, and when the vessel thus filled has been placed on the ground, it
shall be taken away by them.

(*c*) Or again, ‘*Apapātra*’ may mean broken vessel; as it is going to
be asserted (in the next verse) that ‘they shall eat in broken dishes.’

‘*Their wealth shall consist of dogs and donkeys*’—They shall not
receive cows or horses, or gold and silver, as their wealth.—(51)
