People think agriculture to be a good occupation; one who carries on
agricultural operations obtains much grain, whereby he feeds guests;
that is why it is ‘good.’ To the same end we have such assertions as—‘He
who does not till the ground is not loved by his guests,’ ‘one should
carefully carry on agricultural operations,’ and ‘the plough, the spear,
tills the soil etc., etc.,’ (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 12.71)

This view however is not the right one to take. This is an occupation
that is despised by the righteous;—and the reason for this lies in the
fact that ‘*the iron-tipped wood*’—the plough—‘*injures the Earth and
the earthly creatures*,’—*i.e*., those creatures that live under the
ground, *e.g*., the caterpillar and the rest.

“What sort of injury is inflicted on the Earth? The Earth certainly does
not suffer pain, like the living creatures, by the stroke of the wooden
implement.”

What the text means is that the Earth does suffer pain, and thereby
forbids all tearing of the ground.—(84)
