‘*Maitreyaka*’—by name.

‘*Begets*’—*i.e*., on the ‘Āyogava’ woman.

The ‘*Vaidehaka*’—*i.e*., one who is born from a *Brāhmaṇa* mother and a
*Vaiśya* father.

‘*Maireyaka*’ is another reading for ‘*Maitreyaka*.’

‘*Madhūka-like*’—This word expresses a simile; it means that the man is
‘as sweet as the *madhūka* flower,’ being possessed of a sweet voice.
Or, it may mean ‘he who behaves like the *madhūka* flower’;—the word
being formed with the ‘*Da*’ affix; and the elongation of the second
vowel being one that is permitted in the case of several words; the
elongation of the first vowel being due to the reflexive affix.

‘*Who praise men constantly*’—and are called on that account ‘bards.’

‘*At sun-rise*’—at the time of the rising of the sun,—these people ring
the bell; with a view to awaken the King and other rich men.

The caste here mentioned is begotten on the ‘*Āyogava*’ woman,—she being
the woman mentioned in this connection.—(33)
