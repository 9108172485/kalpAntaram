‘*Ajīgarta*’—The sage of that name—‘*suffering from hunger*, *went
forward to* *kill* *his son*’—Sunaḥśepa, and yet he was not regarded as
‘carnivorous.’

The story of Sunaḥśepa occurs in the Ṛgveda; and it is not necessary for
us to dilate upon what occurs in the scriptures.

As a matter of fact however, this is a declamatory statement in the form
of the assertion of an act done by somebody.

All such passages should be understood to be the same.—(105)
