If the Śūdra be in want of a livelihood, he may serve the Kṣatriya. This
means that the serving of the *Kṣatriya* will serve only as a means of
subsistence, and will not bring any merit; which means that the serving
of a Brāhmaṇa accomplishes both purposes.

Similarly he may make a living by serving a wealthy Vaiśya.—(121)
