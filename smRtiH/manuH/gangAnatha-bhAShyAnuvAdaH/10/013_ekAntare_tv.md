From the *Brāhmaṇa*, on the *Vaiśya* girl—who is two degrees lower—is
born the ‘*Ambaṣṭha*,’ and the ‘*Ugra*’ is born from the *Kṣatriya* on
the *Śūdra* girl—who is two degrees lower;—both these being ‘*born in
the natural order*.’ Similarly ‘*in the inverse order*’ the ‘*Kṣattṛ*’
is born from the *Śūdra* on the *Kṣatriya* girl—who is two degrees
higher,—and the ‘*Vaideha*’ is born from the Vaiśya on the Brāhmaṇa
girl—who is two degrees higher.

And both these two sets stand on the same footing, as regards the
performance of the sacred rites,—but not as regards the functions of
officiating at sacrifices and so forth.

Among the products of the ‘inverse marriages,’ the ‘*Caṇḍāla*’ alone is
untouchable; as under verse 5.85, *bathing* has been prescribed as to be
done only when one touches the *Caṇḍāla*, and not any other product of
‘inverse marriages.’ So that as regards the mixed castes, ‘*Sūta*,’
‘*Māgadha*’ and ‘*Āyogava*,’ their treatment as regards *touchability*
and so forth is to be like the ‘*Caṇḍāla*,’ on the ground of their being
mentioned along with this latter, and this on the principle of the
‘stick and the cake’ (where the stick being placed within the cake, what
happens to the one happens to the other also).—(13)
