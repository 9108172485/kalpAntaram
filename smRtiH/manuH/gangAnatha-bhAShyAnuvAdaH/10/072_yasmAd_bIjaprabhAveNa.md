‘*Honoured*’—saluted by men.

‘*Extolled*’—are eulogised with eulogistic words.

‘*The seed is the more important*’;—as held by those who declare the
seed to be the more, important factor. This however is not right; as has
been dearly indicated by [what was said under 70
above](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201805.html).

Or, what the expression ‘*through the power o* *f* *the* *seed*’ implies
is, not the importance of the seed, but a defect;—the sense being
that—‘people might be led to think that, the fact of Mandapāla and
others, born of animals, having become sages *through the power of the
seed*, proves the importance of the seed; but in reality, that the
children became sages was due, not to the importance of the seed, but to
the force of their learning and austerities and to their particularly
meritorious acts.—(72)
