This verse lays down three occasions on which one may accept gifts from
the king.

\(1\) ‘*Suffering privation*’—*i.e*., in times of distress, being
threatened with the possibility of the whole family perishing.

\(2\) ‘*Seeking to obtain wealth*’—in the shape of ear-rings, bracelets,
turbans, seats, gold, etc.

\(3\) ‘*Seeking to obtain riches*’—cattle, gold and other tilings
necessary for sacrificial performances.

Under these conditions Brāhmaṇas may beg of the ‘*king*’—the sovereign
of their country.

The prohibition contained above in 4.84—‘He shall not receive gifts from
the king’—must be taken as referring to a wicked king,—it being added,
‘of one who is avaricious and behaves against the law.’—(‘87).

‘*Unwilling to give*,’—if on being begged, he be not willing to give
what is wanted,—‘*he should be given up*’— the Brāhmaṇas should cease to
live in his kingdom.

Or ‘*giving up*’ may mean *loss*; and as nothing else is mentioned, it
must mean the ‘loss’ of *merit* on the part of the king.—(113)
