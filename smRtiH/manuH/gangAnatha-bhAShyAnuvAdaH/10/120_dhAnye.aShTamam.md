Those dealing in grains should be made to pay one-eighth part of their
profits.

The term ‘*viṭ*’ here stands for *the people*.

For those dealing in gold, the tax is one-twentieth part of their
profits.

‘*Śūdras discharge their dues by work*.’—They should not be made to pay
any taxes. So also craftsmen and artisans. With regard to them it has
been laid down (in 7.138) that ‘they shall work for the king one day
every month’; and the present text permits the taking of more work from
them in abnormal times.—(120)
