“What is the reason that the Brāhmaṇa alone is entitled to what has been
just stated, and not the *Kṣatriya* and the rest also?”

The reason for this lies in the fact that it is in connection with the
Brāhmaṇa that the scriptures put forth commendatory declarations (like
the present text).

‘*On account of distinctive qualities*,’—*i.e*., of peculiar
characteristics; *i.e*., the excellence of his qualities.

These excellences are next pointed out—‘*of the superiority of his
origin*,’—the Brāhmaṇa having sprung from the highest part of
Prajāpati’s body. ‘*Origin*’ means *source*.

‘*Observance of restrictive rules*.’— Inasmuch as the *drinking of wine*
has been forbidden specifically for the *Brāhmaṇa*, it is this
‘*restrictive rule*’ that is meant here. Or they may refer to the
‘observances of the Accomplished Student,’—such as the carrying of the
bamboo staff and so forth,—which have been prescribed for the *Brāhmaṇa*
only.

‘*The peculiarity* *of* *his sanctification*;’—this refers to the
observances of the Accomplished Student; the ‘*peculiarity*’ consisting
in such rules as ‘water reaching the heart’ (2.162) and so forth. It
cannot mean the ‘Initiatory Rite,’ as this is done for the *child* only
(and hence could not refer to the grown up Brāhmaṇa); it is only in the
case of the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* that it is done after the expiry
of childhood.

For these reasons the Brāhmaṇa is the ‘*lord*’—controller—‘*of the
castes*.’—(3)
