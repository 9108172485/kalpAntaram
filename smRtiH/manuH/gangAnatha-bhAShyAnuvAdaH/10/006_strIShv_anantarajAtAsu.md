*Sons begotten*,—*in the natural order*—*on wives of the next lower
caste*’—*i.e*., the caste immediately lower—are to be regarded as
‘*equal*,’—not of the same caste. That is the son of a Brāhmaṇa father
from a *Kṣatriya* mother, or of a *Kṣatriya* father from a *Vaiśya*
mother, is ‘equal’ to the father, and not the very same.

And the reason for this is that they are ‘*tainted with the defect of
their mother*.’

This declaration of ‘equality’ implies that the sons are superior to the
mother, but inferior to the father.

‘*By twice-born men*.’—The use of the plural number and the fact that
the caste is determined with reference to the mothers, indicates that
this is possible only in the case of marriages ‘in the natural order.’
For in the case of marriages ‘of the inverse order,’ the caste would be
determined with reference to the father, who is of a lower caste than
the mother. It is for this reason that the preceding verse has added the
phrase ‘in the natural order.’ What we said in the Bhāṣya on the
preceding verse, that this phrase had been added ‘with a view to what
follows,’ did not refer to this, but to the forthcoming verses.—(6)
