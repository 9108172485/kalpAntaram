‘*Unrequitedly*’—without: receiving any reward.

‘*Defence*’—favour.

‘*Aliens*’—children born in the ‘inverse order.’

‘*Perfection is secured*’;—the attaining of a superior caste is called
‘perfection,’ on the ground of its leading up to it; the meaning being
that these people come to be born in a caste where they become entitled
to the rights and responsibilities of the higher caste.

Or, ‘*perfection*’ may stand for the *attaining of heaven*.—(62)
