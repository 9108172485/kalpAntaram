‘*Savoury articles*’— described above—‘*should* *be* *buttered for
savoury substances* .’ That is, one should receive the *Āmalakī* and
other *acids* after giving, in exchange, sugar and other sweet
substances. But in no case should salt be given in exchange for any
other ‘savoury substance.’

‘*Lavaṇam tilaiḥ*’ is another reading; by which the prohibition would be
only in regard to the bartering of salt for *sesamum* only, and not any
other substance.

‘*Cooked food*’— such as fried flour, cooked rice and so forth—should be
bartered for other kinds of ‘cooked food’—cakes and the like.

‘*Sesamum shall be bartered for corns*’—Vrīhi and the rest—‘*in equal
quantities*.’ That is, given one seer (of sesamum), he shall receive one
seer in exchange; more or less shall not be received, through any
consideration of relative values.

‘Bartering’ also is regarded as a kind of *selling*; on the ground that
the root to ‘*sell*,’ ‘ *Kṛṛ* (?)’is found mentioned among the roots
signifying the act of ‘exchanging.’

This however is not right. Because Gautama has indicated the difference
between the two, by speaking of ‘selling’ and ‘bartering’ in the same
sentence. So that when things are given on the receipt of the rupee or
such tokens, it is ‘selling’; and it is ‘bartering’ when one article is
received in exchange for another article.—(94)
