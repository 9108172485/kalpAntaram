For the *Brāhmaṇa*, the *Vaiśya* girl is ‘two degrees lower,’ and the
child born of her is the ‘*ambaṣṭha*’; called in another *Smṛti*
(Gautama, 4.20) ‘*Bhṛjyakaṇṭha*.’

The child born of the *Śūdra* girl, who is ‘three degrees lower,’ is the
‘*Niṣāda*,’ also called ‘*Pāraśara*.’

The name ‘*Niṣāda*’ also belongs to a caste born from a marriage of the
‘inverse’ order. (See verse 15 below).

The term ‘maiden’ stands for *woman in general*,—say some people;
‘*Vaiśya maiden*’ meaning *Vaiśya woman*; and so on throughout—(8)
