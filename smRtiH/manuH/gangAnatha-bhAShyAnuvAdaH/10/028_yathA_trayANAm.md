‘*For one*’—to the *Brāhmaṇa*—‘*his alter-ego is born from two out of
the three castes*—*i.e*., from the *Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya* woman is born
a son invested with the character of the ‘double birth,’—‘*as also from
his own caste*’ Thus on three castes the Brāhmaṇa begets ‘twice-born
men.’

‘*Even so is among men of the outer circle*’;—*i.e*., sons born in the
‘inverse order,’ for the *Vaiśya* and the *Kṣatriya* father from the
*Kṣatriya* and the *Brāhmaṇa* mother, respectively, are invested with
the ‘double birth.’

And when these sons are invested with ‘double birth,’ they should have
the Initiatory Ceremony performed for them; as is going to be
added—‘These six partake of the character of twice-born persons.’ (41)

The only difference however is that those born ‘in the inverse order’
take the mother’s caste.

As we are going to explain later on, all this is mere commendatory
exaggeration.—(28)
