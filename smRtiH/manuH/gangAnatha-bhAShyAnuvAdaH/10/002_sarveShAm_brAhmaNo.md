It has been already declared that there is to be no ‘teaching of duties’
for the *Śūdra*, in such texts as ‘he shall not teach his duty to him’
(4.80) and it is as an exception to this that we have the present text
laying down that ‘means of livelihood should be explained to him.’

‘*Livelihood*’—maintenance of the family;—the ‘means’ of that he should
know.

‘*Expound to the others*’—The plural number has been used for the
purpose of including the *Śūdra* \[the dual would

have been used if the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* alone had been
intended \].

‘*Himself do accordingly*;’—*i.e*., he shall have recourse to only such
means of livelihood as have been prescribed for him.—(2)
