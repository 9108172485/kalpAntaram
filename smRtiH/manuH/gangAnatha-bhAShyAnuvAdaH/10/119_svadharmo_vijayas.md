The term ‘*Conquest*’ should be taken here to mean *that which leads to*
*conquest* (), which is laid down as the duty of the Kṣatriya.

‘*He shall not turn back in danger*’—Whenever any danger comes ahead, he
shall not turn his back in battle.

In this manner, ‘*having protected*’ the people, ‘*he shall realise the
tax from the Vaiśya*.’ As a rule Vaiśyas are very wealthy; hence people
realising taxes from them, if they are found to behave improperly, are
not punished.—(119)
