title = "007 अनन्तरासु जातानाम्"

+++
The first half of the verse reiterates what has gone before; and the
second half contains a brief indication of what follows.

‘*Two or three degrees lower*.’—For the Brāhmaṇa, the wife ‘*three
degrees lower*’ would be the *Śūdra*; and the Vaiśya would be ‘*two
degrees lower*.’

There is not much useful purpose served by this verse.—(7)
