‘*This*’—refers to what follows.

‘*Such commodities as are sold by Vaiśyas*.’—If the Brāhmaṇa has no
wealth, he may, if pressed for livelihood, sell such things as are
permitted to be sold by Vaiśyas.

‘*Exceptions*.’—This term stands for the commodities excluded. ‘*With
certain exceptions*’;—from which certain articles are excluded. The
Brāhmaṇa may sell the things, with the exception of those hereinafter
enumerated.

‘*For increasing his wealth*.’—This describes the nature of things; it
being well known that trade is conducive to increased wealth.

‘*Renounces the strictness concerning his duties*,’—*i.e*., his strict
regard for his duty. This implies that as a rule the said selling should
not be done; and the upshot of all this is that from out of the several
occupations of the Vaiśya, Agriculture is the worst for the Brāhmaṇa,
then trade, and then cattletending and the rest—(85)
