By duly performing the duties laid down in connection with times of
distress, the highest state is attained. The proper care of the body
does not involve any transgression of an enjoined duty. Hence it is only
right that a desirable result is attained.

This is the reiteration of the scriptural and logical conclusion that
when fallen in distress, one should not hesitate to accept improper
gifts and so forth.—(130)
