The sense is that he shall serve Brāhmaṇas.

‘*When he has attained the title of the Brāhmaṇa*,’—*i.e*., when, on
account of his connection with the Brāhmaṇa, that title becomes applied
to him;—then he should be regarded as having all his ends accomplished.

Or, the meaning may be, ‘when he has come to be known as *related to the
Brāhmaṇa*.’— (122)
