‘*Infidelity*’—Adultery, with women of the same caste, either unmarried,
or married to others either in the ‘natural’ or the ‘inverse’ order.

‘*The marrying of women unfit for marriage*,’—*i.e*., those that should
not be married; *e.g*., sister, grand-daughter and so forth.

‘*Neglect of one’s duties*’—such as Initiation, study of the Veda and so
forth;—according to some people the profession of the *Kṣatriya* also
would be the Brāhmaṇa’s ‘duty’ if it happens to have been followed in
the family for two or three generations.—(24)
