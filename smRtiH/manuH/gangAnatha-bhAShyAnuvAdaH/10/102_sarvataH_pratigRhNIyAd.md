‘*From all*’;—*i.e*., no consideration should be made regarding the
castes whose gifts should or should not be accepted.

Here also what is meant is that among gifts from the low, the lower and
the lowermost castes, those from the succeeding shall be accepted only
when those from the preceding ones are not procurable. Just as the
occupation of the Vaiśya is permitted only when that of the Kṣatriya is
not available.

‘*Pure*’—*e.g*., the stream of the Gaṅgā. This does not become ‘defiled’
by coming in contact with impure substances, since it has been declared
that ‘the river becomes purified by its own flow.’ The same is the case
with the Brāhmaṇa also.—(102)
