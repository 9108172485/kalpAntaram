This is meant to serve as an introduction to the subject of ‘Duties in
abnormal times.’

‘*Yoni*’ is *source*, *birth*.

*Brāhmaṇas of pure Brāhmaṇa-birth should perform the six acts*:—the root
‘*upa-jīva*’ denoting *performance* here.

‘*In due order*’—in accordance with their rights and capacities; *i.e*.,
each one doing the act to which he is entitled.

Some of the acts serve spiritual purposes, while others fulfill only
material purposes.—(74)
