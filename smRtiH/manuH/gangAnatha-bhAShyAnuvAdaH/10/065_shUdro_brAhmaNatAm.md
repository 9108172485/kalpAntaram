That ‘the Śūdra attains the position of the Brāhmaṇa’ is what, has
already been asserted above.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa sinks to the position of the Śūdra*’.—*The* ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’
meant here should be understood to be the Brāhmaṇa-born ‘*Pārāśatra*.’
If he marries a Śūdra girl of the nature described above, he sinks down
to the lower level, in the third generation. This is how they explain
this.

People who attain the higher caste, according to the principle here
enunciated, become entitled to the sacraments and rites pertaining to
that caste.—(65)
