This verse sets forth the means of livelihood for all men, during times
of distress.

‘*Learning*’—here stands for sciences other than the Veda; such, for
instance, as Medicine, Logic, Physics, Toxicology and so forth,—all
which are not reprehensible, when used as a means of livelihood.

‘*Handicraft*.’—This has been already explained.

‘*Working on hire*’—as a servant

‘*Service*’—acting according to the wishes of another person.

‘*Contentment*’—This has been added only by way of illustration.

The meaning of this verse is that in the absence of the particular means
of livelihood specifically assigned to each caste, these ten means are
open to all men.—(116)
