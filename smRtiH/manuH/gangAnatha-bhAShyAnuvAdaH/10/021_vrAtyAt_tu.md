‘*On wives of the same caste*’—of the preceding verse—is to be construed
with this also.

Though the caste of the women is not specified in this text, and yet it
being necessary to know her caste, we learn it from another *Smṛti*,
where it is said that—‘The, son born to the Brāhmaṇa from a *Vaiśya*
woman is called *Bhṛjjakanṭaka*’ (Gautama, 4.20).

The characteristic of this caste is stated—‘*evil-natured*.’ The one
described before (under 8) is not ‘evil-natured,’ because he is born ‘in
the natural order’; the one mentioned here is rightly decried, because
he is born of an Apostate for whom the sacramental rites have not been
performed, and is, as such, not entitled to any religious acts.

The several names are mentioned not merely by way of synonyms, but in
order to show by what names the particular mixed caste is known in
different countries.

The older writers however explain that the second and following names
are those of the successive descendants of the ‘*Bhṛjjakaṇṭaka*.’ That
is, the son born from the Brāhmaṇa mother is the ‘*Bhṛjjakaṇṭaka*,’ that
born from the ‘Āvantya’ mother is the ‘Āvantya’ or the ‘Vāṭadhāna’; from
the ‘Vaṭadhāna’ mother is born the ‘Puṣpadha,’ and from the ‘Puṣpadha’
the ‘Shaikha,’ and so on.—(21)
