[Under
86],
the selling of ‘cooked food and sesamum’ has been forbidden; and to this
the present verse is an exception, in view of certain special conditions
and purposes.

‘*Pure*,’ ‘*not kept long*’;—these refer to the *condition* of the
grains; and ‘*for* *sacred purposes*’—refers to the *purpose*.

‘*Pure* ’— ‘not mixed with *Vrīhi* and other grains. There is
possibility of mixed sesamum being sold for the purposes of preparing
‘mixed food.’

‘*Not kept long*.’—This implies that the man shall not keep back the
grains with the idea that they are selling cheap now, but after a few
days they shall fetch higher prices.

Or, ‘*pure*’ may mean *not black*; the prohibition applying to *black*
sesamum; and sesamum becomes black if kept for a long time. The meaning
is that he shall not sell black sesamum after having grown or bought it.

‘*The agriculturist*,’ ‘*if he has cultivated it himself*.’ These words
are only descriptive, and much significance is not meant to be attached
to them.

The selling of grains obtained in gifts is also not forbidden.

‘*For moved purposes*.’ For instance, when sesamum is sold for the
purpose of obtaining money whereby to buy the cow to be given as a
sacrificial fee, or when it is sold for the performance of Vedic study,
*Agnihotra* and such rites, or when it is sold for the purpose of buying
with the price thus obtained, *Vrīhi* and other corns needed for the
performance of the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. In all these
cases the selling is ‘for a sacred purpose’;—or, when the sesamum itself
is used by the purchaser for such religious acts as making gifts, or for
getting oil for medicinal purposes.—(90)
