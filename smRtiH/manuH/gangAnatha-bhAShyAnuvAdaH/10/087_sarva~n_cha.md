‘*Woven article*’—Things made of cotton yarns; *i.e*., doth, wrapper and
so forth.

‘*Rakta*’—*i.e., red*; the word ‘*rakta*’ is known as denoting the *red*
colour more than the others; *e.g*., it is only the *ruddy* bull that is
called ‘*rakta*.’ Though what the root ‘*rañj*’ (*to dye*) denotes is
only the imparting of some sort of *colour* to what is white. Hempen,
silken and woollen articles,—even when not dyed. The rest is clear.—(47)
