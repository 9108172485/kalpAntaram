This is a deprecatory declamation in support of the foregoing
injunction.

If a certain duty has been prescribed for one, in reference to his
caste,—even though this be ‘*performed imperfectly*’—*i.e*., incomplete
in its details,—it is right to perform that, and not the duty of another
man, even though complete in all its details.

In support of this there is the deprecatory declamation—‘*He who
subsists, etc., etc*.’— (97)
