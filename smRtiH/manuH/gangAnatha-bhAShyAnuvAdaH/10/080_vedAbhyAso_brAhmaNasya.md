‘*Vedic study*’.—Since the subject-matter of the section is the means of
livelihood, this must be taken as standing for the *teaching* of the
Veda.

‘*These are the most useful among their respective occupations*.’ That
is, among the means of livelihood sanctioned by the scriptures for them,
these are most conducive to their welfare, out of all the other
occupations carried on for the purpose of livelihood.—(80)
