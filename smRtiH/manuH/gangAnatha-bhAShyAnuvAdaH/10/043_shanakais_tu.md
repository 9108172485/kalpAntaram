Now follow the details regarding ‘the omission of one’s duties’ spoken
of above.

‘*Omission of sacred rites*’— This includes the rites that are done for
the person, such as Initiation and the rest, as also those that he does
himself, such as the Agnihotra, the Twilight Prayers and so forth. And
the ‘*omission*’ of these is the *non-performance* of both these sets of
rites. Thus one loses his caste not only by the omission of the
Initiatory Rite, but also by the neglecting of those that have been
enjoined as to be done after the Initiation.

This is what is meant by ‘*gradually*—which means that the continued
neglect of the rites reduces successive generations to the position of
the *Śūdra*; and this does not refer to the new-born child, who loses
his title only by the omission of his Initiation.

It is not that the man’s caste becomes *lost*; all that happens is that
he becomes liable to be called by such castes-names as the
‘*Bhṛjjakaṇṭaka*’ and the rest.

‘*By the neglect of Brāhmaṇas*,’—*i.e*., by transgressing the
injunctions pertaining to Brāhmaṇas. Or it may refer to not consulting
the Council of Brāhmaṇas in doubtful matters arising out of the
scriptures, in regard to expiatory rites and other cognate matters.—(43)
