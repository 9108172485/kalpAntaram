The first three quarters of this verse contain a mere reiteration of
what has gone before; and the fourth serves the purpose of pointing out
the meaning of the term ‘*Apasada*,’ ‘*Lowborn*’;—the meaning being that
the children of the three castes born of women one, two and three
degrees lower should be known as ‘low-born.’

These are called ‘low-born’ because, though they serve the purposes of
the ‘son,’ they are of a lower status than the son born of a wife of the
same caste.—(10)
