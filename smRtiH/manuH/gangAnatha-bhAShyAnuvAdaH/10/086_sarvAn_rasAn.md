There are six flavours, *rasas*,—sweet and the rest; and the term
‘*rasa*,’ ‘*savoury substances*’ here stands for substances abounding in
one or other of these *flavours*; such as sugar, pomegranate, the
‘*kirāta*,’ the ‘*tiktaka*’ and so forth; all these are forbidden; and
not only those that are made of the *juices* extracted from the trees
etc., (which is the literal meaning of ‘*rasa*’). Though the term
‘*rasa*’ is not used directly in the sense of *substance*, in the way in
which ‘white’ and such terms are, yet it indirectly indicates it; just
as in the case of the expression ‘the ranch on the Gaṅgā,’ (the term
‘Gaṅgā’ indicates the *river-bank*).

‘*Shall avoid*’—shall give it up; *i.e*., shall not sell.

‘*Cooked food*’—such as rice cooked and ready for being eaten.

‘*And sesamum*.’—Sesamum also shall not be sold; and it is not meant
that what is forbidden is such food as is *cooked with sesamum*, and the
selling of each separately is permitted.

‘*Stones*’—Of all kinds.

‘*Salt*’—Even those that are not in the form of stone (solid); rock-salt
being already included under ‘*stones*.’

If the term ‘*rasa*’ is understood in its literal sense, of the *six
flavours*, then, since ‘*salt*’ will have been already included under
this, the separate mention of ‘*salt*’ would mean that the selling of
this is absolutely forbidden for all time, while that of ‘*sweet*’ and
the rest is only partially so.

‘*Animals*’— Tame as well as wild.

‘*Human beings*’— Men.—(86)
