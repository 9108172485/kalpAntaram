The reiteration of this also is stated in the form of a declamatory
statement.

In reality the taking of something belonging to another is very wrong;
but some form of it may be less wrong than another. Thus both the
receiving of gifts and the gleaning of ears of corn, belonging to the
same category (of taking what belongs to another), the latter is said to
be ‘*better*’ than the former. It is only between two *bad* things
belonging to the same category that one is regarded as the ‘better’ of
the two; no one says that ‘the Brāhmaṇa is better than the Caṇḍāla.’
Thus then even though the gleaning of ears and picking of grains also
involve the taking of what belongs to another, yet these are ‘better.’

Though living by ‘gleaning ears’ and ‘picking grains’ has been described
as the best form of living, yet it does bear some resemblance to the
‘receiving of gifts.’ So that in the case of both these—‘gleaning ears’
and ‘receiving gifts’—one should exercise a certain amount of check over
himself. Thus it is that living by ‘gleaning ears’ and ‘picking grains’
also is not entirely free from blame; hence it is that we have the
declaration that—‘gleaning ears is better than receiving gifts.’—(112)
