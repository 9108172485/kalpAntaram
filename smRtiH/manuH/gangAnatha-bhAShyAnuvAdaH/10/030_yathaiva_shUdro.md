The birth of sons among persons of the ‘inverse’ castes themselves, from
each other’s wives has been described. Now the birth of sons from women
of the four castes is described.

The verbal root ‘*Sū*’ (to *be born*) has been used in this text as
synonymous with to *produce*; ‘*prasūyate*’ moaning *begets*.

This is indicated in the next verse.—(30)
