‘*Which*’—denotes question.

If the ‘seed’ forms the more important factor, the children born from
mothers of lower castes gradually attain the higher caste of the father;
and the same principle might be applied to the case of the ‘soil’ being
regarded as the more important factor. So that, just as the child born
to the Brāhmaṇa father from a ‘Non-Aryan,’—*i.e.,
Śūdra*—mother—‘*some-how*’—*i.e*., even when the woman is not his
married wife,—would attain the higher caste—so also ‘*the child born to
a non-Aryan from the Brāhmaṇa woman*’ would attain the higher caste, on
the ground of the ‘soil’ being the more important factor;—it having been
declared (under 9.34) that ‘predominance attaches sometimes to the
*seed* and sometimes to the *soil*’— (66)
