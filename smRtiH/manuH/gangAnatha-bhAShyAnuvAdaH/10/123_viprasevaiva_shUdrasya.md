The serving of the Brāhmaṇas is the chief duty for the Śūdra.

Hence ‘*everything else*’—in the shape of observances and fasts—‘*that
he does is fruitless for him*.’

This should not be understood to be the prohibition of such acts as
making gifts, offering the ‘*Pākayajñas*’ and so forth; since all these
have been distinctly enjoined for him. In fact this prohibition of
‘everything else’ is only meant to indicate the importance of ‘serving
Brāhmaṇas.’—(123)
