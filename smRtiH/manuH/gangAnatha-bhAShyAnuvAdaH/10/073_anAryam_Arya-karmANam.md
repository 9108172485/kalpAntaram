‘*Non-ārya*,’— Śūdra.

‘*Behaving like an Ārya*,’—devoted to the service of twice-born men,
performing the *Pākayajña* sacrifices, always respectful towards Gods
and Brāhmaṇas.

‘*Ārya*’—Brāhmaṇa and the rest.

^(‘)*Behaving like a non-ārya*,’—doing what is forbidden and omitting
what is enjoined.

Having ‘*examined these two*,’—*i.e*., having considered their relative
merits; having pondered over the question whether the one or the other
was superior in his qualities,—Prajāpati, Manu, made the declaration.

^(‘)*They are not equal*.’—Inasmuch as ‘caste’ is the most important
factor, the Śūdra, even though possessed of superior merit, can never be
equal to the Brāhmaṇa.

He said again—^(‘)*they are not unequal*’;—for though of superior caste,
the Brāhmaṇa is beset with many defects.

The meaning of all this is that no man can be respected simply on the
strength of his caste; what wins respect is quality; if one is devoid of
good qualities, his caste cannot come to his rescue; for if it did, then
there would be no point in the prescribing of expiatory rites.

[From verse
66](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201801.html)
to the present one, the text is intended to be a deprecation of the
‘confusion of castes,’ and the praise of the due performance of one’s
duties; there is nothing either enjoined or forbidden, nor is anything
new asserted. Hence all these verses should he taken as purely
commendatory.
