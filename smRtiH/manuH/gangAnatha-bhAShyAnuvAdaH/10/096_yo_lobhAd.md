‘*A man of low caste*’—The Kṣatriya and the rest Though the context
deals with the *Kṣatriya*, yet this verse is meant to be an interdict
upon all occupations of the Brāhmaṇa, for all the other castes.

‘*Superior*’.—It is the Brāhmaṇa alone who is *absolutely* (not only
relatively) ‘superior.’

‘*Occupations*’.—Teaching and the rest.

If he subsists by these, he should be punished with confiscation of
property and banishment.—(96)
