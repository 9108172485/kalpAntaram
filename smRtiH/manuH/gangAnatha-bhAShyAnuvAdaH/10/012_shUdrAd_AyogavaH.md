Here also the names are to be taken respectively.

Though the terms ‘*Vaiśya*’ and ‘*Rājanya*’ (without the feminine ending
are denotative of the mere castes, yet from the force of implication
they are understood to mean the girls of those castes; just as in the
case of such expressions as ‘*Mṛgakṣīram*’ and ‘*Kukkuṭāṇḍam*’ (where
the *mṛgī*, the *female deer* and the *Kukkuṭī*, the *hen*, are meant).
The feminine endings have been dropped on account of metrical
considerations.—(12)
