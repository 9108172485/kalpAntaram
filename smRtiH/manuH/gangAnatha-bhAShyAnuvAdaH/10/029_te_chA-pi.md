‘*Those*’—the six castes, ‘Āyogavas’ and the rest—*beget several alien
sons, on each other’s wives*;—*i.e*., the *Kṣattṛ* on the wife of the
‘*Āyogava*’ and so forth,—‘*beget sons, despised*’—lower in grade than
their father,—*e.g*., the *Āyogava* begets on the wife of the *Kṣattṛ*,
a son who is more ‘alien’ than himself; and one still more ‘alien’ on
the wife of the *Caṇḍāla*, and so forth.—(29)
