The division of the functions into groups of three is for a distinct
purpose. One group of three has been put forward as serving (temporal)
ends, while the other is conducive to invisible (spiritual) ends.

‘*Pure*’— Not. addicted to sinful deeds.

“But the Śūdra also could be *pure*.”

Why should you have an aversion to that.?

“It would he contrary to other *Smṛti* texts, where it is laid down that
‘the Brāhmaṇas feed at the house of, and receive gifts from, such
*twice-born persons* as are praiseworthy for their actions.’ In face of
this the present text should be explained in such a manner as to avoid
the contradiction of those other texts. For so long as a reconciliation
of varying texts is possible, it is not right to admit of such
contradiction.”

As a matter of fact, the present text is merely reiterative; the real
*injunction* having gone before, in such texts as—‘he shall seek to
obtain wealth from Kṣatriyas, etc., etc.’ (4.33).
