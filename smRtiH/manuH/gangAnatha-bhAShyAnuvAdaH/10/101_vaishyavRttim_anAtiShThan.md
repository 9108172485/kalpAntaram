‘*Does not adopt*’—*i.e*., being unwilling to adopt What this means is
that, in the event of the Kṣatriya’s occupation being not available, he
may have recourse either to the receiving of gifts from wrong persons or
to the occupation of the Vaiśya,—both these standing on the same
footing; the occupation of the Kṣatriya however would be superior to the
receiving of improper gifts.

Or, ‘*does not adopt the occupation of the Vaiśya*’ may also mean—‘the
occupation of the Vaiśya being not available to him.’ In this case, the
receiving of improper gifts would be inferior to the occupation of the
Vaiśya.

‘*Resolved to stick to his own path*.’—This indicates that this sums up
all the occupations permitted during times of distress.

‘*Distressed through want of livelihood, and Pining*’—*i.e*., fallen in
ruin.—(101)
