There are three theories, each being held by some sage or the other.

\(1\) Some people assert that the ‘seed’ is the more important factor;
so that the child born to a Brāhmaṇa from a woman of the Kṣatriya or
other castes, is superior to his mother’s caste.

\(2\) Others declare the ‘soil’ to be the more important; whence the
‘soil-born’ son belongs to the caste of the mother from whom he is born,
and to whom he belongs.

\(3\) Others again hold that both are equally important; as declared in
69—‘as good seed sown in good soil etc, etc.’

Not satisfied with any of these views, the Author adds—‘The decision on
*this point is as follows*;’—*i. e*., after full consideration the
following decision has been arrived at.—(70)
