The meaning of the word ‘*remnant of food*’ has been already explained.
The food left after the feeding of guests and others should be given to
the Śūdra servant.

Similarly ‘*worn-out clothes*’—after they have been washed white;
‘*grain refuse*’—the seedless chaffs, and ‘*furniture*’—beds and
seats.—(125)
