‘*Even though he is able*’—by means of agriculture and such acts,—wealth
shall not be amassed by the Śūdra. In support of this the Author adds an
argument in the form of a declamatory statement—‘*Having acquired wealth
the Śūdra harasses the Brāhmaṇas*.’

“What is the harassment caused to Brāhmaṇas?” Becoming very rich, they
would make the Brāhmaṇas accept gifts from themselves, and the accepting
of gifts from the Śūdra has been forbidden for them; hence becoming a
party to their doing what is forbidden, he would incur sin.

The danger of incurring such sin however could not apply to the case of
one who goes on fulfilling all that is prescribed for him. Hence the
‘harassment’ of the Brāhmaṇa that is meant is only this that he would no
longer serve them.—(129)
