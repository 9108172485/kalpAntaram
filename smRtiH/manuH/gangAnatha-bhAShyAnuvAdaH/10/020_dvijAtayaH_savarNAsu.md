These do not belong to any inversely mixed caste; and yet they are
mentioned here with a view to what follows in the following verses.

‘*The sons begotten by the twice-born men on wives of the same
caste*’,—if they deviate from the duties in connection with the
Veda—*i.e*., if they fail to become regular Religious Students and so
forth,—and as such ‘*become excluded from the Sāvitrī*’,—and hence fail
to pass through the Initiatory Ceremony,—they should be designated as
‘Apostates.’

‘*Avratān janayanti*’—would not be the right construction; because when
children are born they are neither ‘fulfillers,’ nor ‘non-fulfillers,’
‘of sacred duties;’ since the Initiatory Rite is prescribed as to be
performed only *after* the child has been born. Hence the term
‘*avratān*,’ ‘*not fulfilling their sacred duties*,’ has to be taken as
representing what is meant by the definition of the ‘Apostate’ as
provided here,—such representing being necessary for the setting forth
of what follows.

Some people read—‘*avratāyāñjanayanti tan vrātyān*, etc.’—‘they should
designate as *Apostates* those whom the twice-born men beget on wives
who are unfaithful.’

But this is not right; as this would be incompatible with the accepted
definition of the ‘Apostate’.—(20)
