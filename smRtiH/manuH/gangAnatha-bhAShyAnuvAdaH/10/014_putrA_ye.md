The child born of the *Brāhmaṇa* on the *Kṣatriya* or the *Vaiśya*
mother, as also one born of the *Kṣatriya* father from the *Vaiśya* or
the *Śūdra* mother,—they call by the name of the lower caste; *i.e*.,
their caste is the next lower in the natural order; which means that
they are of their mother’s caste.

Ṃuch significance is not meant to attach to the term ‘next lower,’ hence
it is added—‘on *account of the taint attaching to their mothers*.’ That
is they are not affected by the superior caste of their father. Hence,
even though in reality they belong to ‘mixed castes,’ yet they have been
declared to be of their mother’s caste. And this means that the proper
sacramental rites should be performed. Apart from the present text,
there is nothing to indicate that for the persons concerned the
sacramental rites proper for the *Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya* should be
performed. And the reason is that like the *mule*, their caste is a
totally different one. But since the present text declares that they are
of their mother’s caste, there can be nothing wrong in the performance
of their sacramental rites.—(14)
