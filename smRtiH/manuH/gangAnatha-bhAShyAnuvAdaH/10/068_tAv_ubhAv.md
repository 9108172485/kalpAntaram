Both kinds of children just described,—*i.e*., the *Caṇḍāla* and the
*Pārāśara*—‘*are unfit for the sacraments*’;—i.e., should not be
‘initiated.’

The text proceeds to add a declamatory statement by way of an argument
for what has been just asserted—^(‘)*The former on account of the defect
in his birth*’;—in the wise of the child born to a. Brāhmaṇa from the
Śūdra woman, even though predominance may attach to the ‘seed,’ his
birth is really *defective*, by reason of the lowness of his origin.
‘*The latter*,’—the Caṇḍāla, is born ‘in the inverse order,’ and is the.
worst of the ‘inversely horn sons,’ on account of the lowness of his
father, even though the ‘soil’ be regarded as the more important
factor.—(68)
