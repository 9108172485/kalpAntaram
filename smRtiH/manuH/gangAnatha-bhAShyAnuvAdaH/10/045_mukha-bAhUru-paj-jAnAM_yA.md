That language is called ‘*mlecchaa*,’ ‘*barbaric*,’ which consists of
words that either have no meaning, or have a wrong meaning, or are wrong
in form. To this class belong the languages of such low-born tribes as
the Śabara, the Kirāta, and so forth.

‘*Refined language*’ is the language of the inhabitants of Āryāvarta.

These persons, being other than those named as the ‘four castes,’ are
called ‘*Dasyu*.’

The meaning is that neither habitation nor barbaric speech is a ground
for regarding a caste as ‘mixed’; it is the fact of people being known
by the particular names that makes them to be so regarded. It is thus
that they come to be called ‘Dasyu.’—(45)
