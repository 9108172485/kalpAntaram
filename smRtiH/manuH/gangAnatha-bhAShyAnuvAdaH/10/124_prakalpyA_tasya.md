What is here laid down is the duty of the twice-born men (who engage
*Śūdras*). When the Śūdra is serving them, they should provide for his
maintenance, ‘*out of their,family*’;—that is, he should be looked after
like a son.

‘*Having considered*’ his own ‘*capacity*,’ as also, the man’s
‘*skill*’—application to work, and ‘*the burden of persons to be
supported by him*,’—*i.e*., his wife and children, they shall take into
consideration all the persons to be supported by him, and make provision
for the maintenance of all these.—(124)
