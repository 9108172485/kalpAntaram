In view of the term ‘*on Vaideha woman*’ occurring later on (37), the
meaning must be that ‘*on the Vaideha woman*, *from the Niṣāda* is born
the *Kārāvara*.’

From the *Vaidehaha* are born the two castes ‘*Andhra*’ and ‘*Meda*,’—
on what women?—on the *Kāravara* and the *Niṣāda* women respectively.
That such is the meaning is implied by the fact of these two being the
last spoken of. We explain the verse to mean this in view of the fact
that an entirely different caste is born from the *Vaideha* father on a
*Vaideha* mother. Thus then what is meant is that from the father of the
same caste are born two different castes,—this difference being due to
the difference in the castes of the mothers.

‘*Outside the village*’— is their ‘*dwelling*,’ livinghouse.—(36)
