When ho finds it difficult to maintain himself, his family and his
business, and he is unable to obtain wealth sufficient for all this,
then he is said to be ‘*unable to subsist*.’

‘*As described above*’;—*i.e*., by Teaching and the rest Ho may make,
like the Kṣatriya, a living by guarding over villages and towns, by
carrying arms and weapons, and also, if possible, by ruling over the
people.

The exact meaning of ‘making a living’ has been already explained; it
does not stand here for the mere maintenance of one’s own body; it
implies the maintenance of the family and also the carrying on of one’s
business.

‘*He is next to him*’—‘*pratyanantara*’ is the same as ‘*anantara*.’
Inasmuch as the text has provided this reason, it follows that the
occupations of those removed by further degrees (*i.e*., of the Vaiśya
or the Śūdra) involve sin for the Brāhmaṇa. Though the abandoning of his
own occupation would be the same in all, yet it should not be thought
that there is no difference in the degree of transgression of the law
involved in having recourse to the occupations of the Vaiśya and those
of the Śūdra; since, as the next verse declares, the Brāhmaṇa may have
recourse to the occupation of the *Vaiśya*).—(81)
