This verse sets forth a declamatory statement, in the form of an
argument in support of what has gone before.

The very nature of men is such that persons not initiated do not study
the Veda, and do not perform sacrifices; so that in times of distress,
the Brāhmaṇa might very well teach and sacrifice for the *Śūdra*. As for
gifts on the other hand, it is well known that it may be received from
all castes; so that it is quite possible to receive it from a *Śūdra*
\[so that it is more easily procurable\]. It is for this reason that the
receiving of improper gifts (from wrong sources, outside the four
castes) is the *meanest* of all.—(110)
