Viśvāmitra is a well-known great sage. On one occasion, when he suffered
much from hunger, ‘*he proceeded to eat the haunch of a dog, receiving
it from the hands of a Carṇḍāla*.’

The ‘*dog’s* *haunch*’ has been mentioned with a view to show that there
is harm in the eating of not only such food as has been defiled, but
also of that which is defective by its very nature;—the sense of the
verse being that in times of distress one may take even such food as is
tainted with all kinds of defects.—(108)
