*Objection*.—“It would have sufficed to say ‘he who knows not the
return-greeting’; the addition of the phrase ‘of the greeting of
salutation’ is superfluous and not quite compatible.”

It is not so; the construction is—‘the return-greeting *in keeping with
the* greeting of salutation.’ For instance, propriety demands that (*a*)
if the salutation has been offered with the name of the accoster duly
pronounced, then in the return-greeting, the final vowel of the name
Should be pronounced ultra-long; (*b*) and he who salutes with the form
‘It is I, Oh, Sir,’ is to be answered without his name being uttered and
without the elongation of any vowel.

‘*Does not deserve to be saluted*’;—this prohibits the uttering of the
words of greeting; the sense being that ‘salutation may be offered,’ but
not with the words ‘it is I, Sir,’—the circumstances under which these
words are to be used h aving been shown before (under 123).

‘*As the Śūdra*,’—this appears to be by way of illustration; for as a
matter of fact the Śūdra also, when of great age, is held to be
deserving of salutation.

‘*By the learned*’;—this has been added only for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(126)
