This also is a purely commendatory description.

It has been asserted above that *knowledge* singly is superior to wealth
and other things taken together; and the same idea is re-iterated in
greater detail, in this verse.

‘*Among Brāhmaṇas*, *seniority is by knowledge*’—not by wealth, etc.

‘*Among Kṣatriyas by valour*’;—‘*va* *lour*’ stands for the ‘efficiency’
of a substance and also for ‘firmness of strength.’

‘*Among Vaiśyas by grains and riches*’;—‘*grains*’ being mentioned
separately, the term ‘*riches*’ is to be taken as signifying *gold*,
etc.; just as in the expression ‘*brāhamaṇa-pariv* *rājaka*.’ \[Where
the Brāhmaṇa being mentioned separately, the term ‘*parivrājaka*’ is
taken as standing for the renunciate of other castes.\]

The Vaiśya possessing a large quantity of wealth is regarded as senior.

The affiix ‘*tasi*’ (in the words ‘*jñānataḥ*,’ etc.) denotes cause, and
is used in accordance with Pāṇini 2.3.23.—(155)
