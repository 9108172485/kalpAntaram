‘*Who fails not*’—who does not omit the servise; *i.e*., by serving
these ‘*he wins*,’—makes his own, obtains mastery over—‘*the three
regions*.’

‘*The householder*.’—It is when the son has reached the householder’s
stage that his service becomes of great value to his parents and others;
as by that time they become old.

‘*Radiant*.’—Shining, resplendent with his own effulgence. ‘*Like a
God*,’—*i.e*., like the Sun.

‘*Rejoices in heaven*’—in the heavenly regions.—(232)
