This is another commendatory statement pertaining to the injunction of
Vedic Study contained in the Vājasaneya-Brāhmaṇa.

The construction is—‘*ā* *nakhāgrebhya eva*.’

‘*Ha*’ denotes *hearsay*.

The term ‘*highest*’ having already signified the high character of the
penance, the phrase ‘*to his very nail-tips*’ h as been added with a
view to expressing the fact that the penance intended is higher even
than the highest; the sense being that even though the nail-tips are
insensible, yet they also are affected by the penance; the *Kṛcchra* and
other penances, not pervading over tho nail-tips, are not productive of
all that is desirable; but the penance in question reaches even those
tips. This is the special praise bestowed upon the penance.

‘*Tapyate tapaḥ*’;—tbe augment ‘*yak*’ and the *Ātma* *nepada* ending
are in accordance with Pāṇini 3.1.88, by which the root ‘*tap*’ takes
the said augment and ending, when governing the noun ‘*tapas*.’

‘*Even though garlanded*.’—One who wears a garland is called
‘garlanded,’ *i.e*., the man who wears a string of flowers.

This epithet indicates the renouncing of the restraints imposed upon the
Religious Student. The meaning is that, even if one were to renounce the
duties of the Religious Student, and yet recite the Veda ‘*to the heat
of his capacity*,’—as much as he can do, even though that be
little,—‘*daily*’—every day,—he becomes endowed with excellent success.

This is mere praise; it does not moan that one should read the Veda
after renouncing the restraints.—(107)
