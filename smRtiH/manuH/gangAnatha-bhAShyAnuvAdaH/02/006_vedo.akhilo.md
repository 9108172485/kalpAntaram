Our answer to the above objection is as follows:—

The authors of treatises on Dharma proceed to compose their works for
the expounding of their subject for the benefit of such persons as are
not learned (in the Vedas). Hence it is that having themselves learnt
from the Veda that the *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts should be performed,
they incorporate in their own work the injunctions of these acts, for
the purpose of conveying the same knowledge to others similarly in the
case of such matters as the authoritative character of the Veda \[which
are known by the *Smṛti-* writers themselves from the Veda, and yet they
proceed to include that information in their work for the edification of
persons not equally learned\]. As a matter of fact, there are many
enquirers who are incapable of ascertaining truth by means of
independent reasoning,—not being endowed with an intellect capable of
ratiocination; and for the benefit of these persons even a logically
established fact is stated by the writers in a friendly spirit. Hence
what is herein stated regarding Veda being the source of Dharma is a
well-established fact. What the statement ‘Veda is the source of Dharma’
means is that ‘the fact of Veda being the source of Dharma has been
ascertained after due consideration, and one should never doubt its
authoritative character.’ Even in ordinary experience we find people
teaching others facts ascertained by other means of knowledge; *e.g*.
\[when the physician teaches\]—‘you should not eat before the food
already taken has been digested, for indigestion is the source of
disease.’ It cannot be rightly urged that “those who are unable to
comprehend, by reasoning, the fact of Veda being the source of Dharma,
can not comprehend it through teaching either”; for as a matter of fact
we find that when certain persons are known to be ‘trustworthy,’ people
accept their word as true, without any further consideration. The whole
of the present section therefore is based on purely logical facts, and
not on the Veda, in other cases also,—*e.g*., in the case of *Smṛtis*
dealing with law-suits, &c.—what is propounded is based upon logic, as
we shall show later on, as occasion arises. How the performance of the
*Aṣṭakā*, etc., is based upon the Veda we shall show in the present
context itself.

The word ‘*Veda*’ here stands for the Ṛg, Yajuṣ and Sāman, along with
their respective Brāhmaṇas; all these are fully distinguished, by
students, from all other sentences (and compositions). Learners who have
their intellect duly cultured through series of teachings, understand,
as soon as a Vedic passage is uttered, that it is Veda,—their
recognising of the Veda being as easy as the recognition of a man as a
Brāhmaṇa. This word ‘Veda’ is applied to the whole collection of
sentences,—beginning with ‘*Agnimīle purohitam*,’ ‘*Agnirvai
devānāmvarua*,’ and ending with ‘*atha mahāvāratam*’ (Ṛgveda); as also
to the several individual sentences forming part of the said collection;
and this application of the word is not direct in the one case and
indirect in the other,—as is the case with the word ‘village’ as applied
(directly) to the entire group of habitations, and (indirectly) to each
individual habitation. In the case of the word ‘village’ the twofold
usage is based upon the principle that words denoting the composites are
also applicable to the components; the word ‘village’ is known to be
used generally in the sense of ‘a group of houses,’ and yet in the case
of such expressions as ‘the village is burnt,’ it ìb used in the sense
of a few individual houses in the village; as it is when people say ‘the
village has been burnt,’ when in reality only a few houses have be in
burnt. Or, in this ease also the word ‘village’ may be regarded as used
in the sense of the *group* only; and what happens is that it is the
*burning*, which, though really pertaining to only a portion of that
group, is spoken of as pertaining to the entire group as related to the
said portion; specially as it is only through its components that a
composite can have any connection with an act; in fact the composite’s
connection with acts can be none other than that of the components;
apart from the components, the composite cannot be either seen or
touched.

We now proceed to explain the etymology of the word ‘*Veda*.’ The ‘Veda’
is that from which people derive their knowledge of Dharma, which cannot
be known from any other source of knowledge—\[ *vidanti asmāṭ iti vedaḥ*
\]; and this *knowledge* of Dharma is derived from each individual
sentence; hence the name is not restricted to the entire collection of
*Adhyāyas* and *Anuvākas* that go under the name ‘*Ṛgveda*.’ It is on
this understanding that the penalty of having the tongue cut off is
inflicted (upon the Śūdra) when he pronounces a single sentence out of
the Veda. On the same principle also is the epithet ‘whole’ found in the
injunction that ‘the *whole* Veda should be studied,’ where it serves to
indicate the necessity of studying all the sentences contained in the
Veda; otherwise (if the epithet ‘whole’ were not there) the learner
would be satisfied with the reading of only a few sentences, and would
not read the whole Veda. All this we shall explain in detail in the
present work.

This *Veda* is variously divided. The *Sāma Veda* is said to have a
thousand ‘paths’ (*i.e*., Rescensions), in the shape of ‘*Sātya*,’
‘*Mugri*,’ ‘*Rāṇāyanīya*’ and so forth; there are a hundred Rescensions
of the *Yajurveda*, in the shape of ‘*Kāṭhaka*,’ ‘*Vājasaneyaka*’ and
the rest; there are twenty-one Rescensions of the *Ṛgveda*; and nine of
the *Atharva Veda* in the shape of ‘*Modaka*’ ‘*Paippalādaka*,’ and so
forth.

\[*Objection*\]—

> “No one regards the Atharva as a *Veda*: (*a*) ‘The science is
> three-fold, consisting of the Ṛk, the Yajuṣ and the Sāman,’ (*b*) ‘The
> Sun moves forward, endowed with the *three* Vedas’ (Taittirīya
> Brāhmaṇa, 3.12.91), (*c*) ‘One should keep up the observance of
> studying the *three* Vedas’; \[all these speak of only *three*
> Vedas\]. In fact we also find a prohibition regarding the Atharva—‘One
> should not recite the Atharvaṇas.’ It is in view of all these that
> people regard the followers of the Atharvaṇa as *heretics*, beyond the
> pale of the *Vedic Triad*.”

\[*Answer*\]—This is not right; all good men agree in regarding the
Atharvaṇa as a *Veda*. In this *Smṛti* itself (11.33) we find the
expression ‘*śrutīratharvāṅgirasīḥ*,’ where the Atharva is spoken of as
‘*śruti*,’ and ‘*śruti*’ is the same as ‘Veda.’

Further \[whether a certain Veda is called ‘Veda’ or not is of no
import\]; when certain passages—those prescribing the *Agnihotra* and
other sacrifices, which all people call ‘Veda’—are regarded as
authoritative in matters regarding Dharma, they are so accepted, not
because they are called by the name of ‘Veda’;—because the name ‘Veda’
is sometimes applied to *Itihāsa* and the *Āyurveda* also, when, for
instance, it is said that ‘*Itihāsa* and *Purāṇa* are the fifth Veda’
(*Chandogya Upaniṣad*, 7.1.2), \[and yet these are not regarded as
authorities on Dharma\];—but because they are independent of human
agency, and help to make known our duties, and because they are free
from mistakes; and all these conditions are fulfilled by the Atharva:
such acts as the Jyotiṣṭoma and the like are prescribed in the Atharva
just as they are in the Yajuṣ and the other Vedas. Some people have
fallen into the mistake that the Atharva cannot be *Veda* because it
abounds in teachings of acts dealing with malevolent magic (witchcraft).
As a matter of fact, malevolent magic, as leading to the death of living
beings, is always prohibited.

\[It is described, because\] it is employed by the priests of kings who
are well versed in magical spells; but it is deprecated.

It has been argued above that “the Atharva is not mentioned among Vedas,
in such passages as ‘the Sun moves, endowed with the *three*
Vedas.’”—But the passages quoted are merely declamatory (Arthavāda); it
is therefore of no consequence whether or not the Atharva is mentioned
among them. Or, the passages that speak of ‘three Vedas,’ ‘the triple
science,’ and so forth may be taken as referring to the three *kinds* of
mantras; besides the three kinds of *mantras* found in the Ṛk, Yajuṣ and
Sāma Vedas, there is no fourth kind,—the Exhortations, the Invocations,
the lowly recited Prayers and the Hymns to Indra, and such other Mantras
being all included under these three. In the Atharva Veda also, the
mantras mentioned are all of the ‘Ṛk’ class; hence so far as the
classification according to the *kind* of mantra is concerned, it comes
under the ‘Ṛgveda.’

As regards the interdict placed upon the study of the Atharva Veda, it
indicates a conclusion quite the reverse of that which it has been cited
(by the opponent) to prove: A prohibition is possible only of what is
otherwise possible \[so that the very prohibition proves that the said
study was, and should be, prevalent, except under the circumstances
referred to in the interdict\]. Or, the passage quoted may simply mean
that ‘one should not mix up the performance of acts enjoined in the
other three Vedas with that of those prescribed in the Atharva Veda; for
instance, during the performance of the *Vācastoma* sacrifices, the
reciting of all Ṛk, Sāman and Yajuṣ mantras is enjoined, and the said
prohibition precludes the reciting, at this sacrifice, of the mantras
occurring in the Atharva Veda.

The above-described *Veda*—which is a particular kind of literary
compilation, not by any human author, which is divided into several
‘Rescensions,’ and known under the name ‘*Mantra-Brāhmaṇa*’—is the
‘*root*’—*i.e*., the *authority*, the *means of knowing*—‘*of Dharma*.’
‘*Root*,’ here means *cause*. The *Veda* and *Smṛti* can be a ‘cause’
only in the sense that they serve to *make known*,—not in that of
*producing*, nor in that *helping to stand*, which are the two senses in
which the ‘*root*’ is the *cause* of the Tree.

The term ‘*dharma*’ we have already explained above; it is that which a
man should do, and which is conducive to his welfare, and of a character
different from such acts as are amenable to perception and the other
ordinary means of knowledge. Land-cultivation, service, &c., also are
conducive to man’s welfare; but this fact of their being so beneficial
is ascertained by means of positive and negative induction; and as
regards the sort of cultivation that brings a good harvest of grains,
this is ascertained by direct perception and other ordinary means of
knowledge. On the other hand, the fact of sacrifices being conducive to
welfare, and the manner in which they are beneficial, through the
intervention of the ‘Apūrva,’—all this is not amenable to perception or
other ordinary means of knowledge. ‘Welfare’is that which is, in its
most general form, spoken of as ‘pleasure,’ consisting of the attaining
what is desirable, in the shape of Heaven, landed property and so forth,
and also (*b*) the avoiding of what is generally spoken of as ‘pain,’
which consists of illness, poverty, unhappiness, Hell and so forth.
Others regard the attaining of Supreme Bliss only as ‘welfare.’

This *Dharma* is learnt from such passages in the Brāhmaṇas as contain
the ‘*liṅ*’ and other injunctive expressions. In some cases we learnt it
also from *mantras; e.g*., from such mantras as ‘*Vasantāya kapiñjalān
ālabhale*,’ ‘offers the Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta’ (*Vājasaneyi
Samhitā*, 24. 20). Among these such passages as contain the word
‘*Kāma*’ (‘desire’) indicate that the act therein enjoined is to be
performed for the purpose of obtaining a definite result; *e.g*.,
‘*brahmavarcasakāmaḥ*,’ (‘one desirous of acquiring Brahmic glory should
offer cooked rice to Sūrya’), ‘*Vaiśvadevīm* *sāṅgrahiṇīṃ nirvapet
grāmakāmaḥ*’ (‘one desirous of acquiring landed property should offer
the Śāṅgrahini to the Viśvedevas’); and the actions thus enjoined are
not done by one who is not desirous of obtaining the particular results
spoken of. There are other acts which are pointed out as compulsory, by
means of such words as ‘*yāvajjīvam*’ (‘throughout one’s life’) and so
forth. These are not performed with a view to any results,—there being
no results mentioned as following from them. Nor will it he right to
assume, in this case also, a definite result in the shape of Heaven, in
accordance with the ‘Viśvajit’—principle (laid down in the Pūrva-Mimānsā
Sūtra 4.3.15-16); because the presence of such words as ‘throughout
life’ and so forth already indicates that these are to be performed
without any reference to results, and the omission of these acts simply
involves the sin of disobeying the scriptural injunction. So that it is
with a view to avoid this sin that the acts thus prescribed are
performed. This same holds good regarding prohibitions—such as ‘the
Brāhmaṇa should not he killed,’ ‘wine should not be drunk’; the avoiding
of the prohibited act is not for the purpose of any reward, but simply
for the purpose of avoiding something sinful;

‘*Entire*,’—whole. That is, there is not a single word, consonant or
vowel (of the Veda) that is not conducive to *Dharma*.

Some people raise the following objection against this:—

> “It has been asserted that the Veda consists of injunctions,

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is just in view of these
doubts that the Author has added the epithet ‘*entire*’; by which it is
meant that all these passages that have been cited by the objector help
in providing knowledge of Dharma.

\(A\) First, as regards *Arthavādas*, these are not meant to be
construed apart from the injunctive passages; it is only if they were so
construed that they would fail to help in the knowledge of *dharma*. As
a matter of fact, we find that if the Arthavāda is taken apart by
itself, it remains syntactically defective; and this leads us to
conclude that they subserve the purposes of the corresponding injunctive
passages; being so subservient to these latter, they come to be
construed along with them; and hence they have got to be explained in
such a manner as to make them fit in with the corresponding injunction.
Thus the mention of Prajāpati having cut his fat cannot be taken by
itself; it has to be taken as supplementing an injunction; in view of
the fact however that the Arthavādas do not denote a substance, a
sacrificial accessory, or any such thing as generally forms the direct
object of injunction, they are construed differently, as eulogising what
is directly enjoined, and thus come to be recognised as supplementing
the injunction. This praise of the enjoined thing is also expressed by
the Arthavāda; for instance, the sense of the passage in question is
this—‘it is so necessary to perform animal-sacrifices that, at a time
when no animals were available, and there was no other remedy, Prajāpati
constituted himself into the animal and cut out his own fat.’ That such
is the construction to be put upon the Arthavāda is shown by the fact
that whenever we have *Arthavādas*, they always accompany injunctive
passages. Thus even though the sense of the injunction is comprehended
even without the accompanying *Arthavāda*,—*e.g*., in the case of the
injunction ‘one should offer the Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta,’ we
comprehend the injunction from the sentence itself,—yet the Arthavādas
are not absolutely useless; for when the Arthavāda is there, it is not
right to deduce the injunction from the injunctive sentence only. The
Veda is not the work of any author; we cannot argue (from the analogy of
human speeches) that ‘since in one case the injunction has no Arthavāda
to help it, it need not have it in another case also’;—the *Arthavādas
are* there, we *have* to construe them; and what we have shown above is
the only right way in which the particular Arthavāda can be construed.
Nor is there anything very extraordinary in this; in ordinary practice
also, we find eulogistic words accompanying injunctions; for instance,
at the time that the master is paying -wages to his servants, some
servant says affectionately (in regard to another)—‘This Devadatta is a
good servant, he is always present, knows the occasions of service and
is always careful about it.’ Thus we find that *Arthavādas* also serve
the purpose of *enjoining*, through the eulogising of what is enjoined
by the injunction. In fact, in certain cases, details of what is
enforced by the injunction are got at from the *Arthavāda* only; for
instance, when the injunction says, ‘wet pebbles are to be put in,’ this
injunction stands in need of some *wetting substance*, such as butter
oil, etc.; so that when it is followed by the Arthavāda ‘Butter is
glory,’ this praise of Butter leads us to conclude that Butter is the
welting substance to be used. Similarly the Arthavāda ‘those who have
recourse to these *Rātris* become respected’serves to point out the
qualifying conditions for the performers of the *Rātri-satra* sacrifice.
From all this it is clear that *Arthavādas* also are ‘*the root of
Dharma*.’

\(B\) Next as regards *Mantras*, some of them are directly injunctive;
*e.g*., the *Mantra* ‘*Vasantāya kapiñjalān ālabhate*’ (‘offers the
Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta’);—in connection with the *Āghāra-offering*,
the deity to whom the offering is to be made is pointed out by the
mantra ‘*Ita Indra urdhvo*’ *dhvaraḥ*, etc.’ In this case the Deity is
not mentioned in the passage that enjoins the offering, nor is it
mentioned in any other purely injunctive passage; the particular
*mantra* to be used however is directly enjoined as being the one that
begins with ‘*Ita Indra*’; hence it is from the words of this *mantra*
that we learn the name of the requisite Deity. There are thousand, of
such instances where the Deity is indicated by the words of the
*mantra*. Then, there are certain *mantras* that are only descriptive of
what is being done; and these also serve the purpose of making known
*Dharma* by reminding (the persons engaged in the act, of what is to be
done); and thus these also become ‘*root of Dharma*’ by indicating what
*should be done*.

\(C\) Thirdly, as regards the *Names*, they are never found apart from
verbs, and hence, like verbs, they have their character of being the
‘*root of Dharma*’ well established, Then again, as a matter of fact,
the accessory details of sacrifices are generally enjoined through these
*names* (of sacrifices); *e.g*., (*a*) ‘In the *Śarat* season one should
perform the sacrifice,’ (*b*) ‘one desirous of Kingdom of Heaven should
perform the *Vajapeya*’ \[in the former we have the injunction of the
*time* of performance, and in the latter, of the *Result*, and both are
mentioned along with the name of the sacrifice ‘*Vājapeya*’\].

Thus it is proved that the ‘*entire* Veda’ is the ‘root of Dharma.’

Other people have taken the word ‘*entire*’ as added with a view to the
possible objection that no knowledge of Dharma is provided by the Vedic
passages laying down the *Shu??a* (Śyena?) and such other objectionable
acts, or by the Prohibitions—such as ‘one should not eat garlic.’

The objection anticipated by these people is as follows:—

> “The *Śyena* and other sacrifices of the kind are in the form of
> malevolent spells; and partaking of the character of *murder*, they
> are distinctly of the nature of ‘*Himsā*’ (Injury); and since all form
> of injury is cruel, and all evil spells have been prohibited, these
> sacrifices must be ‘*Adharma*,’ the opposite of ‘*Dharma*’ (sinful).
> \[And since the Veda lays down such sacrifices\] the ‘*entir*’ Veda
> cannot be the ‘root of *Dharma*.’ Por ‘*Dharma*’ has been explained as
> ‘what should be done,’ and certainly the killing of the Brāhmaṇa is
> not ‘what should be done.’ How then can the passages laying down such
> acts be the ‘root of Dharma’? Further, even the
> animal-sacrifices—*Agniṣomīya* and the rest,—involve the killing of
> animals, and as such are very far removed from the character of
> ‘Dharma.’ That killing is sinful is admitted by all enquiries. To this
> end it has been said ‘where the killing of living beings is *Dharma*,
> what can be *Adharma*?’”

Now how is this objection anticipated? It is anticipated (say these
other people) by the adding of the epithet ‘*entire*.’ There is no other
use for this epithet.

It might be asked why no reason has been given \[by Manu, why and how
the entire Veda is the root of Dharma\]; but our answer is that this is
a work in the form of Precept, and as such states well-established
conclusions; and those persons who seek after the ‘why’ and ‘wherefore’
of these conclusions are instructed by *Pūrvamīmāmsā*.’We have already
said that this work is addressed to persons who are prepared to learn
tilings from Precept alone.

The author of the *Vivaraṇa* however puts forward a few arguments
also:—It has been argued by the opponent that the *Śyena* and other such
sacrifices, being prohibited, must be ‘*adharma*’ sinful. This is quite
true. But even though these acts are prohibited, yet in certain cases it
so happens that some people may have their animosity too strong to allow
of their submitting to the general prohibition of *killing*,—in such
other passages has ‘no living beings should be killed,’—and such persons
derive from the *Śyena*, the pleasure of killing their enemy; and to
that small extent, as conducive to this pleasure, the *Śyena* may be
regarded as ‘*dharma*’; so that the passage prescribing the *Śyena* does
not cease to be the ‘source of Dharma.’ Secondly, as for prohibitions,
it is only a person who is moved by passion to do the killing that is
guided by the prohibition; and the acting up to the prohibition only
consists in not doing what is prohibited \[and this desisting from the
prohibited act is meritorious, *Dharma* \] Thirdly, the prohibition of
killing does not apply to the killing that is done in course of the and
other such offerings; and what is prohibited by the general prohibition
of killing is only that killing in ordinary practice which is done
through malice. That killing, on the other hand, which is distinctly
enjoined and has scriptural sanction, can never form the subject of
prohibition; specially as the prohibition has its use in connection with
ordinary killing. Nor is it possible to deduce the sinfulness of the
scriptural killing, on the analogy of ordinary killing, from the general
proposition that ‘all killing is sinful.’ Because what makes the killing
sinful is not merely its character of ‘killing,’ but also the fact of
its being prohibited; and we have already pointed out that the
prohibition does not apply to the scriptural killing.

-----------------------------------------------

Some people explain the word ‘*mūla*,’ ‘root’ to mean *cause*;—the
meaning being that ‘of Dharma Veda is the root,—the basis, the
cause—either directly or indirectly.’ It is the ‘direct cause of Dharma’
in such passages as ‘one should study the Veda,’ ‘one should get up the
Ṛgveda, etc.’; and it is the ‘indirect cause’ when it points out the
detailed form of the *Agnihotra* and such other acts.

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Smṛtiśīle ca tadvidān*’—‘*Conscientious Recollection of persons versed
in the Veda*’;—‘*Smṛti*,’ ‘*Recollection*’ is the idea that one has of
what has been apprehended before.—The pronoun. ‘*tat*’ (in the compound
‘*tadvidām*’) stands for the *Veda*; and those who know the Veda are
called ‘*Vedavidaḥ*,’ ‘*versed in the Veda*.’ The meaning thus is that
another ‘authority’ (means of knowing) for *Dharma*. consists in the
idea, ‘this should be done, that should not be done,’ entertained by
people learned in the Veda.

> “It has been held that Recollection is not a reliable means of
> knowledge; and the reason for this that is given is that Recollection
> only serves to recall what has been apprehended by other means of
> knowledge, and does not lead to the apprehension of anything new.”

This is true; for the persons to whom the recollection belongs, it is
the original means of knowledge—Trustworthy Assertion or Perception,
etc.—that constitutes the reliable source of knowledge; and one’s own
Recollection is not a reliable source of knowledge for himself. But for
us (ordinary mortals), it is the Recollection of Manu and such other
persons that forms a reliable source of knowledge; we have no other
means, except the said Recollection, for knowing that the *Aṣṭakā* and
such other acts should be done. That the Recollection of Manu, etc., was
actually in a certain form, we learn from the assertions made by
themselves that have come down to us through a long line of tradition.
And from this Recollection we come to the conclusion that the
subject-matter of them was actually apprehended by Manu, etc., by the
ordinary means of knowledge; and this is indicated by the fact of the
Recollection being there, and no.Recollection being possible without
previous apprehension.

> “It is quite possible that Manu and others have compiled their
> ‘Recollections’ from imagination, without having actually apprehended
> what they speak of; in the same manner as certain poets compose a
> story after having created the whole plot from imagination.”

The answer to this is as follows:—This might be so, if the works under
consideration did not contain teachings regarding what ‘should he done.’
Teachings regarding what should he done are meant to lead to the
performance of those acts; and certainly no ìational person can ever
perform what is taught on an imaginary basis.

> “But people might he led to perform it by mistake.”

One man might fall into such a mistake; that the entire world has fallen
into a mistake, and this mistake has persisted ever since the beginning
of creation,—this would certainly be a most extraordinary presumption.
And when it is quite possible that the assertions of Manu, etc., are
based upon the Veda, there is no room for the assumption that in
following them.people have fallen into a mistake. We also do not admit
that Manu and others directly *perceived* the *Dharmas*; because
‘Perception’ is that cognition which follows when the sense-organs are
in contact with the objects cognised; and certainly no such contact with
the sense-organs is possible for *Dharma*, for the simple reason that it
is *what should be done*, and *what should be done* is not an
accomplished entity, and it is only an accomplished entity that comes
into contact with anything. It is true that (though perception does not
apprehend non-existent things) Inference and the other means of
cognition do bring about the apprehension of things *not existent* at
the time,—*e.g*., when people see a line of ants moving along with their
eggs, they infer the *coming* rain; but even these latter means of
cognition do not provide any knowledge of *what should be done*.

All this leads, us to conclude that, in as much as the Recollection
pertains to *what should be done*, it must have a source that is similar
to itself; and such source can be the Veda only. The Veda that we thus
infer (to be the source of the Recollections) must have been directly
perceived by Manu and others and the Vedic texts in which the Dharmas
laid down in the Smṛtis were originally prescribed (and which we do not
find in the Vedas now) must have been contained in such Rescensions as
have been lost.

On this point, the following alternative views suggest themselves as
possible:—

(*a*) The Rescensions may be one or several; and it is inferred that
from among these some contain the injunction of the *Aṣṭakā* and some
that of others. (*b*) Or, it may be that all the Rescensions are
available even at the present day; but the details of the *Dharmas* are
scattered about among them; so that while one Rescension contains the
originative injunction of the *Aṣṭakā*, another contains the injunction
of the substance to be used at it, a third enjoins the Deity, and yet
another lays down the Mantra; and what Manu and other compilers have
done is to bring together in one place all these scattered details, with
a view to make them more easily understood. (*c*) Or, that the Dharmas
in question have their origin only in the indications of Mantras and
Arthavādas. (*d*) Or, these Dharmas, having been performed by men from
time immemorial, and having been handed down by an unbroken line of
tradition, must be regarded to be as eternal as the Veda itself. (*e*)
Or, the action of Manu and others also, like that of ourselves, must
have been based upon the authority of some other source, and as such
their assertions must be based upon such Vedic texts as have always been
assumed by inference (and never actually perceived by any one in any
Veda).

These and such other alternative views have been fully considered by the
author of the *Vivaraṇa*; and the definite conclusion arrived at is as
follows:—The performance of the *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts laid down
in the *Smṛtis* must be regarded as sanctioned by the Veda; because they
are found to be connected with purely Vedic injunctions, on perceiving
which latter the performers undertake the performance. The said
connexion we have already shown above;—in some cases what is prescribed
in the Veda is subservient to what is laid down in the *Smṛti*, and
sometimes it is the contrary; sometimes the Veda contains the
originative Injunction of the act in question, sometimes its qualifying
conditions, and sometimes it lays out a mere *Arthavāda*, an eulogistic
description. In this manner all those acts that are prescribed in the
*Smṛtis* are connected with Vedic injunctions.

We have discussed this matter fully in the as follows:—

‘Between what is laid down in the *Smṛti* and what is prescribed in the
Veda, there is a close connection. There is not much difference between
the two, either as to the character of their performers or to the nature
of the acts themselves. Those same persons who perform the acts
prescribed in the Veda,—if they also do what is mentioned in the Smṛtis,
it follows that these latter have their source in the Veda. The
principal criterion of the authoritative character of a certain text is
its acceptance by persons learned in the Veda; and the fact of the
performing agents being the same in both cases has been put forward (in
the Pūrvamīmānsā Sūtra 1.3.2) as a ground for inferring the existence of
Vedic texts in corroboration of the *Smṛtis*.’

For going any further than this and for coming to particulars (as to
where these corroborative Vedic texts are to be found etc., etc.), there
is no reasonable ground; nor is there any necessity (it being sufficient
for our present purpose that all that is contained in the *Smṛti* has
its source in the Veda).

It is quite possible that certain rescensional texts of the Veda may
have been lost. Even at the present day we find several such texts as
are read by very few students. And some people have held that what the
authors of the *Smṛtis* have done is to bring together the purely
injunctive passages, shorn of their accompanying *arthavādas*, contained
in such rescensional texts as were found by them to be likely to be lost
(for want of learners). Āpastamba (1.4.10) for instance, says—‘the
injunctions are those laid down in the Brāhmaṇas,—their exact words have
been lost—but they can be inferred from the details of the actual
performance.’

But this theory involves many impossible and unheard of assumptions,
such as the neglect of, and the total disappearance of all the learners
of, just that Vedic text which was the most useful, being that in which
were declared all those *Dharmas* pertaining to castes and life-stages
that are set forth in the *Smṛtis* and the *Gṛhyasūtras*.

The other view however is more reasonable,—that learned persons, who
have formed definite conclusions of their own on all important matters,
should compile a practical compendium of all such injunctions as are
scattered over (in various sections of the Veda), beset with
*arthavādas*, and difficult to determine what is conducive to the good
of man and what is meant only to complete the sacrificial performance.

But under this hypothesis also, there is this difficulty, that in cases
where the *Smṛti* rule runs counter to a Vedic rule, hoth would have to
be regarded as equally directly *Vedic*, and as such representing
optional alternatives; so that the *Smṛti* could not be set aside by the
Veda. And this certainly cannot be accepted by the learned. In fact the
authors of the *Smṛtis* themselves admit that the basis of the *Smṛti*
in the Veda is only inferred, and that the former is always set aside in
favour of the latter. For instance, Gautama says (3.35)—‘There is only
one life-stage, say the revered Teachers; since the householder’s life
is the only one that is directly enjoined.’ If Manu and the other
writers (who speak of four life-stages) had actually found the Vedic
texts (upon which they based their division of the four stages),—then
what would be the sense of the expression that ‘the house-holder’s life
is the only one that is directly enjoined (by the Veda)’? For according
to the hypothesis under discussion all the four stages would be equally
*directly enjoined*. \[Nor is the above-quoted *Sūtra* the statement of
a foreign opinion.\] In fact it embodies Gautama’s own opinion, which he
has put forward as the opinion of ‘revered teachers.’ This is clear from
the fact that he has begun the section with the statement ‘Now as
regards the various views that h ave been held regarding the
life-stages’ (3.1), and he has concluded with the Sūtra (3.35) quoted
above.

The authoritative character of *Mantras* and *Arthavādas* (as means of
knowing *Dharma*) is not inconsistent. Though it is true that
*Arthavādas* only serve to eulogise what has been enjoined by an
Injunctive sentence, and they do not exercise the function of enjoining
anything,—yet there are instances in which even the connection of the
*Arthavāda* with an Injunctive sentence is not possible unless the
former has afforded some; idea of an injunction in regard to something
expressed by its words. For instance the *Arthavāda* passage ‘Theft of
gold, drinking of wine, etc., etc.’ (*Upaniṣad*, 5.10.9) cannot be
understood as pertaining to the Injunction of the ‘Science of the Five
Fires,’ until it is known that the ‘theft of gold’ and the rest are
prohibited; the sense of the whole being that ‘he who studies this
science of the Five Fires does not fall, even though he commits the
theft of gold, etc., or associates with persons who have committed
them—otherwise he does fall’?

This is not right; for even though the *Arthavāda* has a distinct
meaning of its own, yet since its connection with the Injunction is
based upon syntactical connection, there can be no room for any
objection as regards syntactical split.

As regards the *Mantras*, they are, by their very nature, indicative of
the form of action; and since the action cannot be got at from any other
sources, we are led to assume an act indicated by the *Mantra*,
specially with a view to justify its indicative character. And since in
connection with the *Aṣṭakā*, it is not possible to have an indication
of such origination and qualifying condition as are absolutely
nonexistent, wo take the *Mantras* as suggestive of the action, its
qualifying condition and its very origination. It is in this way that
Injunctions are accepted as supplied by the words of a *Mantra*. As for
instance, the injunction of the Deity of the *Āghāra* offering (is
supplied by the *Mantra* ‘*Ita Indra urdhva*, etc., etc.’)

It is admitted on all hands that *Dharma* has four ‘feet’; now, it is
only a small portion of this vast fabric of *Dharma* that has been
directly prescribed in the Veda; and the source of the knowledge of all
the remaining factors also must be similar in character to the Veda, for
the simple reason that the factors of *Dharma* can only be known through
some sort of an injunction. So that (directly or indirectly) the
connection (of *Dharma*) with Veda is inevitable.

Now (as regards the work of Manu) what happened was that Manu got
together pupils who had studied several Vedic texts, as also other Vedic
scholars, and having heard from them the several texts, he compiled his
work; and he has therefore clearly stated that Vedic texts are the
source of what he has written, and thereby established the trustworthy
character of his work. Others that came after him performed the several
duties, relying upon Mann’s own words, and did not try to trace his
words to their source (in the Veda). All this is what we infer (from the
circumstances of the case).

Thus even in cases where a *Smṛti* rule may run counter to what is found
to he laid down in the Veda, both must he equally ‘Vedic’ \[since the
*Smṛti* also is based upon Vedic texts actually found by the writer\];
and yet it is quite reasonable that the former should he discarded in
favour of the latter; for when all that we need for the performance of a
certain act is found by us in the Vedic text itself, there is no desire
on our part to seek for, and infer the existence of, any other Vedic
texts (in support of anything that may he found in the *Smṛtis*). Just
as in the case of the *Sāmidhenī* verses, though the two numbers,
*seventeen* and *fifteen*, are both equally mentioned in available Vedic
texts, yet when we have once found that the number *fifteen* is
applicable to the action in hand, we have no desire to have recourse to
the number *seventeen*, even though this also is directly mentioned in
the Veda. Then again, it is only natural that what is directly expressed
by the words of a text should set aside what is only indirectly
indicated by the requirements of what has been directly expressed, this
indicated factor being admittedly remoter and hence weaker than the
directly expressed one. But this does not mean that what is indirectly
indicated has no force at all. In fact such a case would be analogous to
the case where, even though the employment of the details of the
archetypal sacrifice at the ectypal one is admissible by the general
injunction (that ‘the ectype should be performed in the manner of its
archetype’), yet when any such archetypal details are found to be
incompatible with those that may be found to be expressly prescribed
specifically in connection with ectype, the former are unhesitatingly
discarded. \[Similarly when the indicated factor is incompatible with
the expressed one, it is discarded.\]

Under the view \[previously put forward as (*d*)\] that the *Smṛtis* are
based upon an unbroken Unit of performers, the position of the *Smṛtis*
would be no better than that of mere current tradition, which does not,
at any stage (however longstanding it may have become), attain
reliability (based upon direct Vedic support).

The other view \[put forward as (*e*)\] also, according to which Vedic
texts in support of what they did and wrote were always *inferred* by
Manu and others,—does not differ very much from the view that they are
based upon tradition. We have proceeded to examine the source of the
*Smṛti* or Recollection of Manu and others; and if they also only
*inferred* the Vedic texts, just as we are doing now, then, like
ourselves, they also would not be *recollectors* (of Vedic texts). Nor
is it possible to infer a thing that has never been directly perceived
by any one; as no affirmation (and hence no premiss) could be possible
with regard to such a thing. As regards the inference (that has been
cited by Śabara), of the motion (of the Sun) and such other things, a
general connection (between motion and change of location) is always
perceived; or such motion may be deduced from Presumption based on
apparent inconsistency. Such basis of presumption however is not
available in the case in question.

From all this it follows that in the matter of *Dharma*, there is
certainly some sort of connection between Manu and others and the Veda;
but the exact character of this connection we are unable to ascertain.
In fact, when persons learned in the Veda have the firm conviction that
a certain act *should he done*, it is only right to assume that this
conviction is based on the Veda, and not upon a misconception; it is
only thus that wo would be assuming a source of knowledge in keeping
with the character of the knowledge itself. And this assumption rests
upon the possibility of such source being found in Vedic texts, in the
form of *mantras* and *arthavādas* scattered far and wide by reason of
lapses (of time, etc.). In some cases we also find direct Vedic
Injunctions themselves, as the source (of what is found in the *Smṛti*);
*e.g*., the injunction that ‘one should not converse with a woman in her
courses,’ which is found in the Veda in connection with *Upanayana* and
*Study* (supplies the basis for the general prohibition of such
conversation, contained in the *Smṛtis*).

What we have stated here is only a small portion of this vast subject;
more of this should be learnt from the *Smṛtiviveka* \[as follows\]:—

From all this it follows that when Gautama speaks of the Householder’s
Life being ‘directly enjoined’ (by the Veda), what he means is that the
words of the Veda enjoin it directly, without the intervention of any
other process; that which is cognised immediately after the hearing of
the words is said to be ‘directly known’; while after something has been
cognised, if the reflection over the capacities of that thing leads to
the cognition of another thing, this latter is not said to be ‘directly
perceived.’ Thus everything becomes duly established.

-----------------------------------------------

\[Having discussed the idea expressed by the expression ‘*Smṛtiśīle ca
tadvidām*,’ the Author next proceeds to explain the words
themselves\]—‘*Smṛtiśīle tadvidām*’ ‘*the conscientious re-collection of
those versed in the Veda*,’—The compound ‘*smṛtiśīle*’ stands for
‘*Smṛti* and *śīla*.’—‘*Śīla*’ has been explained as the abandoning *of
love and hate*; and this is a ‘root of a Dharma,’—not like the Veda and
Smṛti, which are ‘root of Dharma’ in the sense of being the source of
knowledge of Dharma,—but in the sense that it is a *means of
accomplishing* Dharma; for by abandoning love and hate one acquires
*merit* (Dharma).

*Question*:—“*Dharma* has been described as what leads to welfare; and
certainly the abandoning of love and hate is itself of that character
(of Dharma); so that there being no difference between the two (*i*
.*e*., between *Dharma* and the *abandoning of love and hate*), how can
it be said that the said abandoning *accomplishes Dharma*?”

*Answer*:—We have already pointed out that the authors of *Smṛtis* use
the term ‘*dharma* s,’ ometimes in the sense of *acts* which form the
subjects of Injunctions and Prohibitions (*i.e., meritorious* and
*unmeritorious deeds*), and also sometimes in the sense of that peculiar
thing (force, *i.e*., merit) which proceeds from the performance of acts
and continues to exist until it has brought its reward (to the doer).
That there is such a thing as this latter can be believed only on the
authority of the scriptures. If the sacrificial performance were to
disappear without bringing about any such *force*, then, bow could its
results appear at some remote period of time? It is this peculiar
something that is meant by the term ‘*dharma*’ here \[when it is said
that ‘the abandoning of love and hate accomplishes *Dharma*.’\] And
certainly the said ‘*Śīla*’ is the ‘root’ of ‘Dharma’ in this sense; so
that there is nothing incongruous in this. The use of the word
‘*Dharma*’ in this sense is common; *e.g*., in the verse—‘*Dharma* is
the only friend that accompanies one even on death’ (*Manu*, 8.17).
Since the act disappears immediately after it has been done, bow could
it continue to exist at any other time (as mentioned in this verse)?

Some people bring forward the following objection:—

> “As a matter of fact, everything that is enjoined in the Veda and in
> the Smṛtis is the *source of Dharma*; and since ‘Śīla’ also is
> included among the acts thus enjoined, there is no point in mentioning
> it separately. In fact Manu himself is going to enjoin it in the
> following verse—‘Day and night one should take care to subdue the
> senses’ (7.41),—and again—‘When the mind has been subdued, the two
> groups of five become subdued.’ And it is this ‘subjugation of the
> mind’ which constitutes the ‘abandoning of love and hate,’ as we shall
> explain later on.”

Some writers answer this by saying that ‘*Śīla*’ has been separately
mentioned with a view to indicate its superior importance; it is
something that comes useful in the performance of all acts; and is
important also by itself; being just like the *Agnihotra* and such other
acts; and further, it is a ‘*Dharma*’ for all castes and conditions. It
is for these reasons that it has been specifically mentioned in the
present verse, which sets forth the most general conception of *Dharma*.

Our explanation however is as follows:—‘*Śīla*’ stands for *Samādhi*,
‘composure of the mind;’ the root ‘*Śīl*’ signifies ‘composing,’ and
‘composure’ is a property of the mind; so that ‘*Śīla*’ here stands for
the withdrawing of the mind from other things and concentrating it upon
what is enjoined in the scriptures.

The copulative compound (‘*Smṛtiśīle*’) connotes interdependence; hence
what is meant to be the ‘source of Dharma’ is ‘*Smṛti*’ (Recollection)
and ‘*śīla*’ (composed mind, *Conscience*) as interdependent; and
‘*śīla*’ does not stand for being the *means of accomplishing Dharma*
(as explained by some people, above). The sense therefore comes to be
that what is the ‘source of Dharma’ is *Conscientious Recollection*, and
not mere Recollection. Hence, even though some persons may be ‘versed in
the Veda,’ yet any recollection that they may have at a time when they
are not duly attentive to the subject cannot be regarded as a valid
source of knowledge of Dharma; and this for the simple reason that
unless people have fixed their attention upon what is prescribed in the
scriptures, they are liable to fall into error.

As regards the particle ‘*ca*’ found in the verse, this ‘should be
construed after the term ‘*tadvidām*,’ ‘*of people versed in the Veda*’;
and it is due to the exigencies of metre that it has been placed before
that term. This particle has a copulative force; and since nothing that
has gone before can be copulated, it serves to bring in here the epithet
‘*sādhūnām*’ (good, righteous) that comes next. So that there are three
qualifications intended here: the ‘Recollection’ that is authoritative
is of such persons as (1) are *learned*, having learnt the soiences from
a qualified teacher (), (2) are attentive to what is prescribed in the
scriptures (*śīla*) and (3) are in the habit of acting up to the
injunctions of the scriptures (*sādhu*, good, righteous). It has been
declared that all these qualifications existed in Manu and other writers
(of Smṛtis). If it were not so, then it would never have been possible
for their words to have been accepted by the wise.

> “If this is what is meant, it should be stated dearly, in the form
> ‘the words of Manu and others, are the sources of Dharma’; what is the
> use of setting forth the characteristics (of the writers)?”

True; but there might be persons who may not agree to the words of Manu
and others being authoritative; and it is with reference to such persons
that the text has set forth the well-established grounds for regarding
them as trustworthy. Even, at the present day, a man who is possessed of
the qualifications mentioned in the text, has his words accepted with
the same amount of trust and confidence as the words of Manu and others;
as we find in cases where learned men pronounce their opinion upon the
precise character of the expiatory rite to be performed by one who has
committed a certain sin. In fact a person possessed of the said
qualifications has ever been recognised as constituting the ‘*pariṣad*’
‘court,’ by himself alone: ‘The Brāhmaṇa should act up to that Dharma
which even a single person learned in the Vedas should declare to be
Dharma’—says Manu (12.113). For these reasons, there can be no
reasonable ground for enumerating the names of ‘Recollectors,’ as ‘Manu,
Viṣṇu, Yama, Aṅgiras’ and so forth. For we find that many such persons
as *Paiṭhīnasi, Baudhāyana, Pracetas* and the rest are recognised by the
wise and learned as reliable ‘Recollectors,’ and yet these names are not
found in any of the lists (supplied by various Smṛtis).

What thus the words ‘*Smṛtiśīle ca tadvidām*’ mean is that ‘when a
person is found to be recognised and spoken of by all wise and learned
persons as endowed with the said qualifications, and they also accept a
certain work as really by that person,—the word of such a person (and of
the work composed by him), even though proceeding from a human source,
should be recognised as an authoritative source of the knowledge of
Dharma. So that even at the present day if there were a person possessed
of the said qualifications, and he were to compose a work by reason of
just those qualifications, then for later generations they would be
accepted to be just as authoritative as the words of Manu and others.
People of the present generation—who would be contemporaries of the said
writer—would not derive their knowledge of *Dharma* from the words of
such a writer, because the sources of information available to him would
be all available to them also. Hence it is that until a teacher of the
present day clearly indicates the source from which he has derived a
certain information, learned people do not accept his word as reliable.
When however he has pointed out his source and his work has been
accepted as authoritative, then at some future time if the case of his
work be found to be analogous to that of the *Smṛti* rules regarding
*Aṣṭakā* and other acts (whose basis in the Veda we of the present day
cannot find), it would be only right to infer its authoritative
character from the fact of its being accepted by the wise and the
learned (which fact could not be explained except on the basis of its
being duly authoritative).

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Ācārascaiva sādhūnām*’ ‘*The practice of Good Men*’;—the particle
‘*ca*’ connects the epithet ‘*vedavidām*’ (*of persons versed in the
Veda*) with this phrase also. These two qualifications (‘goodness’ and
‘Vedic learning’) indicate the ‘*Śiṣṭa*,’ ‘the cultured man.’ The
‘practice of cultured men’ also is ‘source of Dharma.’—‘*Practice*’
means *conduct*, *behaviour*. When, in regard to any action, there are
no Vedic or Smṛti statements, but cultured men are found to regard it as
‘Dharma’ and do it,—then that act also should be accepted as ‘enjoined
by the Veda,’ just like the act prescribed in the *Smṛti*. To this
category belong such acts as the following—(*a*) the tying of the
bracelet and such other auspicious rites performed during marriage,
etc., (*b*) the worshipping of famous trees, Yakṣas, road-crossings and
such things, varying in various countries, done by the girl on her day
of marriage, (*c*) the number of hair-locks kept on the head, varying
with different countries; (*d*) the exact manner of attending on guests,
teachers and other respectable persons, consisting in the addressing of
sweet and agreeable words, saluting, rising to receive and so forth; for
instance, it is customary with some people to recite the *Pṛṣṇi-sūkta*
with grass in hand, when banding over the horse consecrated for the
*Aśvamedha* sacrifice. It is such customs that are meant by ‘Practice’
here. It is not possible to collect in any compilation all such
practices, there being endless forms of them, varying with the
diversities in the nature of men, caused by such variable circumstances
as the calm or disturbed condition of their mind and so forth. The same
act that may have been found, on several, occasions, to be pleasing (to
one person), may, on another occasion, turn out to be unpleasant (to
another person). For instance, a house-holder may be in the habit of
being in constant attendance upon his guests;—this may be quite pleasing
to one guest, who may be pleased at finding the man attending upon him
like a servant; but the same close attendance becomes unpleasant to
another guest, who may feel—‘the feeling of restraint caused by this
man’s constant presence is so galling that I do not find an opportunity
to sit at ease.’ Hence, in corroboration of such ‘Practices’ it is not
possible for us to assume Vedic texts, corroborating them either
collectively or individually. The *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts, on the
other band, have a fixed form; and hence we have *Smṛti* rules regarding
their performance. This is what constitutes the difference between
‘Recollection’ and ‘Practice’ (*Smṛti* and *Ācāra*).

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Ātmanastuṣṭireva ca*’,—‘*Self-satisfaction also*’—‘*is source of
Dharma*’ is to be construed here also. This ‘*self-satisfaction*’ also
is meant to be of those only who are ‘learned in the Veda and Good’
(‘*Vedavidām sādhūnām*’). The fact of this ‘Self-satisfaction’ being
‘source of Dharma’ has been held to be based upon the trustworthy
character (of the people concerned). When such persons as are possessed
of the stated qualifications (of being *good* and *learned*) have their
mind satisfied with a certain act, and they do not feel any aversion
towards it, that act is ‘*Dharma*.’

> “But it may happen that a man’s mind is satisfied with a prohibited
> (sinful) act; and this would have to be regarded as *Dharma*. Again, a
> man may have hesitation (and doubt) regarding what is enjoined in the
> Veda; and this latter would h ave to be regarded as *n* *ot*‘
> *Dharma*.’”

(*a*) As a matter of fact, the ‘self-satisfaction’ of the high-souled
and extremely good men endowed with the said qualifications, is
possessed of such tremendous force that, under its influence ‘*Dharma*’
may become ‘*Adharma*’ and ‘*Adharma*’ become ‘*Dharma*’; but this
cannot be so in the case of men tainted with love and hate, etc.
Whatever goes into a salt-mine, becomes transformed into salt; similarly
everything is rendered pure by the unpremeditated ‘self-satisfaction’ of
persons learned in the Veda. \[The mere fact of an act being prohibited
does dot make it *Adharma* \] for though the ‘holding of the *Ṣoḍaśi*
vessel’ has been prohibited at the *Atirātra* sacrifice, yet when the
holding comes to be done, in accordance With a Vedic injunction, it is
not sinful. But in the present case, there is no question of option, as
there is in the case of the ‘holding of the *Ṣoḍaśi*’. What happens in
this case is that the Prohibitions take effect in regard to all cases
except the one that falls within tho purview of the said
‘self-satisfaction.’

(*b*) Or (the second answer to the objection is that), people like those
mentioned in the verse can never feel any self-satisfaction at what is
‘*Adharma*.’ The mongoose bites only that herb which is an antidote of
poison, and not any other herb; hence the notion that ‘whatever herb is
bitten by the mongoose is destructive of poison.’

(*c*) (*Thirdly*) The revered teachers have explained as follows:—What
is meant is that, in cases of optional alternatives, that alternative
should be adopted in regard to which the mind feels satisfied. It is in
accordance with this that the Author will say later on, in connection
with the purification of things and expiatory rites—‘the penance should
be performed until the mind may feel satisfied.’

(*d*) Or, what is said in the Text may be taken as ruling out the
unbelieving Atheist; as a matter of fact, the Atheist does not feel any
‘self-satisfaotion’ in doing even those aots that are enjoined in the
Veda; hence such acts though done by him are absolutely useless.

(*e*) Or, what the Text teaches is that in the performance of all acts,
one should have a tranquil mind; *i.e.*, at the time of doing anything
one should keep his mind free from anger, stupefaction, grief and so
forth, and should remain happy. Hence like ‘Śīla’ this also is laid down
as pertaining to all acts.
