The Author is going to set forth a set of restraints and observances, in
a section by themselves; and the present verse is intended to emphasise
the importance of these; the sense being that what has been said before
must be done, but what is coming next is even more important and
conducive to superior results.

The term ‘Religious Student’ has been added in order to preclude the
suspicion that a fresh section having begun here, the duties that are
going to bo described are not meant for the student.

“If the text is continuing to describe the duties of the Religious
Student, why should this be regards as a different section?”

Even though what are going to be described are similar in character to
those that have gone before, yet there is a certain superiority
attaching to them; and it is purely on the ground of this slight
distinction that their?tr?eatment has been regarded as forming a
different section.

The remaining words of the Text are explained as added for the purpose
of making up the verse.

‘*Should observe*,’—Should follow.

‘*These*’—Those going to be described. The pronoun ‘this’ always refers
to what happens to be uppermost in the mind.

‘*Living with his Teacher*’—for the purpose of acquiring learning. The
participle ‘*living*’ indicates permanent proximity.

‘*Having fully controlled his organs*’—in the manner described above.
(Verses 88—100.)

‘*With a view to enhancing piety*’;—*i.e*., for the purpose of that
embellishment of himself which is brought about by the proper observance
of the Injunction of Vedic Study.—(175)

The Author proceeds to describe the rules spoken of in the preceding
verse.
