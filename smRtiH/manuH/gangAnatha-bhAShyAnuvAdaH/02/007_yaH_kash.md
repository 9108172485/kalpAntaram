This verse proceeds to make it clear how the authority of the *Smṛti*
(Recollection) is due to its connection with persons knowing the Veda.

‘*Whatever Dharma*’—duties relating to castes, duties relating to
life-stages, duties relating to sacramental rites, in their general or
special forms—‘*for whatever person*’—for the Brāhmaṇa or other
castes—‘*has been described by Manu*’—‘*all this is declared in the
Veda*’—*i.e*., is expounded in it; how this is done has been shown in
the preceding verse.

‘*Since the Veda embodies all knowledge*’;—Veda is the cause, the
source, of all that is worth knowing, in regard to superphysical things.
The affix ‘*mayaṭ*’ has been added in the sense that the Veda is *made
up* of all knowledge; applying to ‘knowledge’ the character of being the
*product* of the Veda. When one thing is the produot of another, the
latter is spoken of as ‘embodying’ the former, *i.e*., of the same
nature as the other; and Veda, being the source of knowledge, is said to
‘embody’ it. According to the *Sāṅkhya* theory of the Product being
always existent in the Cause, the Cause is of the same nature as the
Product.

Or, the meaning may be that ‘the Veda proceeds from all knowledge’ as
its source; the ‘*mayaṭ*’ affix in this sense being used according to
Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* 4.3.81.—(7)
