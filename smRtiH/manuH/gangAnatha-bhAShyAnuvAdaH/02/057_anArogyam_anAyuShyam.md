The present verse proceeds to show that the prohibition of over-eating
is based upon ordinary worldly considerations.

‘*Destroys health*,’—is productive of such diseases as fever, pain in
the stomach and so forth.

‘*Cuts off life*,’—destroys life, bringing on such diseases as cholera
and the like.

‘*Bars heaven*,’—because implying the neglect of one’s body, it involves
the transgressing of such scriptural injunctions as ‘one should guard
himself against all things.’ The ‘barring of heaven’ means *going to
hell*.

‘*Unrighteous*’—productive of misfortune.

‘*Detested by people*’;—the man who eats too much is always looked down
upon as a ‘glutton.’

For these reasons one ‘*should avoid*,’ — *i.e*., not
do—over-eating.—(57)
