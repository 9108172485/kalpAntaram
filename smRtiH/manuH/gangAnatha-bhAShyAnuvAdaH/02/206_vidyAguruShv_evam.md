This also is an instance of ‘Transference.’

Teachers other than the Preceptor are called here ‘intellectual
teacher’—such as the Sub-Teacher and the rest. One should behave towards
these just as it has been detailed above (under 192 *et seq*.).

‘*Towards blood-relations’—i.e*., towards the elder brother, the
paternal uncle, etc

‘*Constant behaviour*’—*i.e*., behaviour as towards the Preceptor.

As distinguished from the ‘Preceptor,’ the other ‘Intellectual Teachers’
are to be so honoured only during the period of one’s learning under
them.

‘*Towards persons*’—friends and others—‘*restraining him from
sin*’—*i.e*., from evils, such as connection with other women and so
forth. It has been said that when one is found to be thinking within
himself of doing some evil deed, then his friends and others ‘should
restrain him from sin, even to the extent of dragging him by his hairs’;
and towards one who restrains him in this way, he should behave as
towards his Teacher,—even if he happens to be of equal or inferior age.

Also towards those who give salutary advice, independently of books. Or,
‘giver of salutary advice’ may be taken as standing for noble-minded
persons in general.—(206)
