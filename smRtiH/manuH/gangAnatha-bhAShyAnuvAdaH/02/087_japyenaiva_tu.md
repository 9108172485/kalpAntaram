*By means of repeating Mantras alone the Brāhmaṇa succeeds*;—*i.e*.,
acquires all desirable results,and also attains Brahman.

No such doubt on this point should be entertained in the mind, as—“How
can one acquire, by means of Mantra-repetition alone, such results as
are obtained only by means of such elaborate acts as the *Jyotiṣṭoma*
and the rest, which cost much effort, or from deep and prolonged
meditations?”—Because as a matter of fact, such success does actually
follow.

‘*He may do anything else*.’—In the shape of the Jyotiṣṭoma and other
non-com pulsory acts, —‘*or* *not do it*.’—For ‘one comes to be called a
*Brahmaṇa if lie is of a friendly disposition*.’ ‘*Maitra*’ is the same
as ‘*mitra*.’ The Brahmaṇa should be friendly to all living beings; and
how can there be any *friendliness* (benevolence) in such acts as the
killing of animals during the *Agnīṣomīya* offerings?

This passage is purely valedictory; it is not a prohibition of the
killing of animals during sacrifices; because it is only supplementary
to what has gone before (and as such it cannot be taken as an
independent prohibition), and because such killing is directly enjoined
in the Veda itself.

*Thus ends the process of Repeating Mantras*.—(87)
