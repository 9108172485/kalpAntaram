\[The question arising \]—“How then is he to listen to and converse with
the Teacher?”—the Text answers:—When the Teacher gives his directions
seated, then the pupil should rise from his seat, and do the ‘listening
and conversing’ while standing.

‘*Advancing towards him, when he* *is* *standing*’;—when the Teacher
gives his orders standing, the pupil should advance towards him a few
steps.

‘*Going forward* *to* *him, when he advances*’;—*i.e*., going up to the
teacher. The prefix ‘*prati*’ has the sense of being face to face.

‘*When he runs*’—moves with force; he should run behind him.
