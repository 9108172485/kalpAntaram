‘*In the fourth month*’—from birth—‘*should be performed the ceremony of
the child’s egress*’—being taken out of the room and shown the sun. This
implies that for three months the child should he kept in the lying-in
room itself.

The common name ‘*child*’ is used, with a view to include the *śūdra*
also.

Similarly ‘*in the sixth month*,’ the ceremony of First Feeding on
grains. For five months the child should he kept purely on milk.

‘*Or, whatever might be regarded as auspicious*’—conducive to
welfare—‘*in the family*’ of the child; such well-known rites, for
instance, as making offerings to *Pūṭanā*, to *Śakunika*, to certain
trees, etc., etc. This may he done at specified times.

This last clause is meant to apply to all ceremonies; so that the
*naming* also may he done according to family custom, even though it be
not in strict conformity with the rules laid down above. Hence with
different families, such names become possible as—‘*Indrasvāmī*,’
‘*Indraśarman*’ ‘*Indrabhūti*,’ ‘*Indrarāta*,’ *Indraviṣṇu*,’
‘*Indradeva*,’ ‘*Indrajyotiṣ*,’ ‘*Indrayaśaṣ*,’ and so forth.—(34)
