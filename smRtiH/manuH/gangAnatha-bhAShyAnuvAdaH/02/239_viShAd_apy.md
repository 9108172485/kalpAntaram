The preceding verse as well as these two verses (239 and 240) are
supplementary to the injunction contained in verse 241.

The present verse cites an ordinary saying in support of the injunction.
Ordinary people say that ‘good may be taken even out of evil.’ If there
is nectar in poison, that should be taken in the same manner as the swan
takes the milk out of water. This is said in reference to certain
medicinal preparations which contain poisonous ingredients.

Even if a child should happen to say something good,—if be pronounces,
for instance, some auspicious words at the time of one’s starting for a
journey,—it should be accepted.

‘*Even from a foe*’—one should learn —‘*good conduct*,’—*i.e*., of
cultured behaviour; and it would not be right to shun such behaviour
simply because it happens to be followed by one’s enemy.

The next instance is still more well known—‘*gold may be taken even from
an impure source*.’

The sense of all this is tbat just as the good things herein enumerated
are accepted even from evil sources, so may learning be acquired even
from a non-Brāhmaṇa.—(239)
