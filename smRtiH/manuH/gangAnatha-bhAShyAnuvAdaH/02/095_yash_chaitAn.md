The present verse formulates the conclusion deduced from th e reasons
adduced in the foregoing verses. \[The sense being\] in as much as
Desire only waxes stronger by fulfilment, hence if a pleasure-seeking
person—in the shape of a young king—‘? *hould attain*’—he addicted
to—‘*all those*’ desires;—while another person—in the shape of the
life-long celibate—‘*renounces them all*,’—*i.e*., does not touch even
the slightest thing;—between these two, the latter surpasses the
*attainer*, the enjoyer. That is, the man who renounces pleasures is
vastly superior.

This is self-evident.—(95)
