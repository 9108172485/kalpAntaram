In fact no one should bo treated with disrespect; specially these. That
is to say, the disrespect of these entails a heavier expiation.

‘*Distressed*’—injured by them.

‘Treating with disrespect’ consists in disregard; the omitting of honour
due; as also insulting, which is called ‘want of respect.’

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ has been added only for filling up the
metre.—(225)
