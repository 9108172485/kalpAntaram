*Question*.—“How can the reward of austerities be obtained by means of
serving the mother, etc., which is not austerity at all?”

*Answer*.—Because attending upon the feet of those persons is the best
form of austerity.

‘*Until he is permitted by them*,’—the pupil—*'should not perform any
other meritorious act*, that may stand in the way of his serving of the
three persons; *e.g*., bathing at sacred places, keeping of vows and
fasts, which, by reason of their leading to the boy’s body being
emaciated, causes anxiety in their minds. Even for the performing of the
Jyotiṣṭoma and other sacrifices, it is necessary to obtain their
permission;

because the disregarding of these persons has been interdicted; and if
the boy were not to consult them regarding the performance of acts
involving much effort and expenditure of wealth, they would feel
bewildered and would feel as if they were disregarded. There is no use
in taking permission for the performing of such acts as are
compulsory.—(229)
