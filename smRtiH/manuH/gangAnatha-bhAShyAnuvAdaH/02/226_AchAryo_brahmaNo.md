This verse is commendatory of what has gone above.

That supreme Brahmaṇ which is described in the Vedantic Upaniṣads—of
that the Preceptor is the ‘*embodiment*’—*i.e*., he is as it were the
very image of Brahman. ‘*The father is the embodiment of
Prajāpati*’—*i.e*., Hiraṇyagarbha. The mother is the same as this
earth,—both being equally capable; of bearing burdens. ‘*One’s
own*’—*i.e*., uterine—‘*brother is the embodiment of the self*’—the
conscious entity within the body.

All the gods here named are possessed of majestic greatness, and destroy
one, if they are treated with disrespect, while if propitiated, they
endow one with all desirable things; and similar to these are the
preceptor and the rest; who thus become eulogised by this verse.—(226)
