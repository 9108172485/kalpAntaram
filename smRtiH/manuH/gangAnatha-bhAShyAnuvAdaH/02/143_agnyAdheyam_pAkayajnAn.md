The rite that brings about the existence of the *Āhavanīya* and other
(sacrificial fires) is called the ‘Fire-laving Rite,’ prescribed in such
sentences as ‘the Brāhmaṇa should lay fire during the spring.’

‘*Cooked sacrifices*’—the *Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa* and the rest.

‘*The Agniṣṭoma and other sacrifices*,’—*i.e*., the Soma-sacrifices. The
term ‘*makha*’ is synonymous with ‘*kratu*,’ ‘*sacrifice*.’

He who perfoms these acts for one is called his ‘*priest*.’ ‘*For him*’
and ‘*his*’ denote relation; the meaning being that ‘the performer is
the officiating priest of only that man for whom he performs the acts,
and not of any other person.’

All these terms, ‘Preceptor’ and the rest, are words denoting relation.

‘*Being appointed*’—being requested; *i.e*., whose appointment has been
made in accordance with the rules laid down in the scriptures.

The ‘Priest’ has been described here, in connection with the mention of
persons entitled to respect; and priests have nothing to do with the
duties of the religious student. This description is supplied here only
for the purpose of indicating that the Priest also is entitled, like the
Preceptor and the rest, to respect.—(143)
