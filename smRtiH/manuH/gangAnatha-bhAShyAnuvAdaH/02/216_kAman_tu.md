‘*May*’ signifies dis-satisfaction on the part of the author; or, it may
bo construed with the next verse.

‘*On the ground*’—the clasping of the feet is not necessarily meant to
be done.

‘*The young man..... to the young wives*’;—*i.e*., what is here laid
down pertains to cases where both parties are young. If the student is a
child, or the Teacher’s wife is old, then the clasping of the feet is
unobjectionable.

‘*Here I am*’;—this refers to the rule prescribed before (in 123).

‘*Proper*’—*i.e*., with upturned hands, etc. (see 72).—(216)
