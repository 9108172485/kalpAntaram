‘*Sanctified in self*’—*i.e*., duly initiated,—‘*the twice-born man
should, by the adoption of this course, accumulate sanctity*.’ ‘*This*’
refers to all those duties that have been laid down for the Religious
Student, from verse 70 onwards. The meaning is that *anena
kramayogena*—by the orderly carrying out of the host of injunctions, one
should accumulate ‘*sanctity*’—self-purification, consisting in freedom
from sin; just as freedom from sin is attained by means of the
*Cāndrāyaṇa* and other austerities, so also is it attained by means of
the course of restraints and observances prescribed in connection with
the study of the Veda. For this reason one should accumulate it,
‘*gradually*,’—without haste, be should acquire it and go on enhancing
it.

‘*Course*’ is ‘process’;—‘this should be done after having done that,
and so forth’; *e.g*., ‘Preceded by the uttering of the syllable *om*,
etc.’ (as laid down in verse 81); and the ‘*adoption*’ of this is taking
up of the performance.

‘*For the learning of the Veda*,’—for the purpose of learning it;
*learning* stands for the *getting up of the text* and *understanding of
the meaning*.—(164)
