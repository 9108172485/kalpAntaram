It is not by reason of his younger age that one is known as ‘child’ it
is the ‘*ignorant*’—uneducated person—who, even though old in age, is
called ‘child.’

‘*Importer of mantras*’—is used figuratively; the sense being that ‘he
who *imparts*,—*i.e*., teaches and expounds,—*the Mantras—i.e*., the
Vedas—becomes the father.’

The particle ‘*vai*,’ ‘verily,’ indicates the support of other
scriptures; and these scriptures (thus referred to) must have been
regarded by the said gods as ancient and authoritative. Hence it is that
we have the term ‘*they have called*.’ which points to a traditional
belief.

‘*The ignorant*’—uneducated—‘*person*,’—‘*they*’—*i.e*., even the
ancients—have called ‘*child*’; —*and* ‘*the importer of mantras, the
father*.’ The particle ‘*iti*,’ occurring after the term ‘*bāla*,’
points to the exact form of the traditional belief;—the construction
being—‘*ajñam bāla iti etena śabdena āhuḥ*,’ ‘the ignorant person they
have called by the name *child*.’ It is on account of the presence of
this ‘*iti*’ that the accusative ending is absent in the term ‘*bāla*.’

This story about the child (Āṅgirasa) occurs in the Chāndogya, and the
author of the *Smṛti* (Manu) has reproduced it here only in sense.—(153)
