Even though the Teacher’s family may fulfil the aforesaid conditions,
yet ‘he should not beg for food’ from that family. ‘*Kula*,’ ‘*family*,’
stands for ‘relations’; hence one should not receive alms from the uncle
and other relations of the Teacher.

‘*Paternal relations*’—from the family of those related to the student
on his father’s side.—‘*From his maternal relations*’—*i.e*., from his
maternal uncle and others.

This verse should not be construed in such a way as to connect the words
‘paternal relations, etc.,’ with the *Teacher*; since the Teacher’s
relations have all been included under the term ‘*Teacher’s family*.’

“From whom then is he to beg for food?”

From houses other than those here mentioned.

‘*When other houses are not available*’—*i.e*., not possible;—when, for
instance, the entire village is inhabited either by the Teacher’s
family, or by his own paternal and maternal relations; and there are no
other families;—or even though they are there, they do not give him
alms;—then the student may beg from those just mentioned; when, others
are uot available, he should first beg from his maternal relations; if
these latter be not available, then from his paternal relations; and
when even these arc not available, then from the Teacher’s family.—(184)
