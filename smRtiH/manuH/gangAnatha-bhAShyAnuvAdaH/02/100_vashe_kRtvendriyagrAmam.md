The present verse sums up the section.

Even though the Mind also is an ‘organ’ yet it is mentioned separately
by reason of its importance.

‘*Grama*,’ ‘*host*,’ means *group*.

Having brought under subjection the organs and the Mind, ‘*me should
accomplish*’—bring about—‘*all his purposes*’—all those results that are
accomplished by means of rites laid down in *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*.

‘*Not injuring*’—causing pain to—his body.

‘*Yogataḥ*,’ ‘*taking care*,’—*i.e*., by careful means. This is added
with a view to such cases in which a person with delicate constitution
suffers great pain if, all on a sudden, he takes to such austere ways of
living as sleeping upon hard beds and wearing the deer-skin and so
forth. The sense is that people, who are accustomed to well-cooked and
delicious food, and to soft beds, etc., should not abandon these all at
once; they should only gradually accustom themselves to things other
than those they are accustomed to.

The term ‘*Yoga*’ may stand for well-graduated activity. In this sense
the epithet ‘*Yogataḥ* is to be construed with ‘*having* *brought under
control*.’

Or, we may construe the epithet just as it stands, the meaning being
that ‘he should have recourse to such methods as not to injure his
body.’ That is, he should not hurriedly renounce what may be necessary
for his body.

Or again, ‘*Yoga*’ may stand for *care*; and the ‘*tasi*’ affix in this
case has the sense of the instrumental; the sense being ‘he should
protect his body with care.’—(100)
