The preceding verse has laid down the ‘fatherly treatment’ (of a
youthful teacher); the present verse supplies, in its support, a
descriptive eulogy of the kind called ‘*Parakṛti*.’ The ‘*son of
Añgiras*,’—‘*Kavi*’ by name,—‘*the child*,’ youthful ‘*His
fathers*’—*i.e*., his paternal and maternal uncles; the sons of these,
and other elderly persons, equal (in dignity) to the father.

‘*Taught*,’—instructed.

Whenever occasion arose for calling them, he called them with the words
‘*little sons*, come here.’

‘*Having received and trained them*’—*i.e*., having accepted them and
made them his pupils.—(151)
