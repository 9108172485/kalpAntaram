That no longing for sensual objects should be entertained by reason of
the teaching of the scriptures may rest aside for the present; in fact
there is even apparent happiness proceeding from the cessation of
desires. When sensual objects are enjoyed, they only tend to produce
stronger desires. For instance, even after a man has eaten his fill,
even to the distension of the stomach, and is fully satisfied, there is
still a longing in his heart—‘why cannot I eat more?’—and it is only
through sheer inability that he does not eat more. This shows that
desire can never cease by enjoyment.

‘*Desire*’—longing.

‘*Of Desires*’—*i.e*., of things desired, longed for.

‘*Enjoyment*’—addiction to.

‘*Is appeased*’—ceases.

‘*Stronger*’—more and more..

‘*By ghṛta*’—by clarified butter.

‘*Kṛṣṇavartmā*’—Fire.

Longing is a form of pain; until one has experienced a certain taste, he
has no longing for it.

This verso only describes the true state of things. It has been thus
described—‘Whatever corns and grains, gold, cattle and women there are
on the earth are not enough to satisfy a single person;—pondering over
this, one should betake hi mself to tranquil restraint.’—(94)
