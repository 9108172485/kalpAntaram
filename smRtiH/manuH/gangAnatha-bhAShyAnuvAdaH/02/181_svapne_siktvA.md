+++
When one renounces his vow of continence intentionally, then he has to
perform the expiatory rite prescribed for the ‘*Avakīrṇī*’ (11.120 *et.
seq*.); the present verse lays down what one should do when he does it
unintentionally.

No significance attaches to the mention of ‘dream’; the *absence of
intention* is the only necessary condition; and no intention can be
present during dreams. Hence this same expiatory rite is to be performed
in a case where, even though he may be not asleep, the flow occurs
involuntarily, in the same manner as certain other fluids flow out of
the body.

The sense of the verse thus is that—‘if one drops his manhood
unintentionally, he should perform this expiatory rite that he should
recite the three verses, etc., etc.—(181)
