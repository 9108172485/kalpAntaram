‘*By this verse*’—by the *Sāvitrī*.

‘*Bereft*’;—he who fails to observe the Twilight Prayers and neglects
Vedic Study.

‘*Odium*’—Blame.

‘*Among good men*’—Among the highly cultured people.

‘*Incurs*’—becomes open to.

With a view to show what sort of odium he incurs, the Text adds—‘*and of
the timely performance of his own duty*.’—‘*Timely*’—*e.g*., the
sixteenth year for the Brāhmaṇa and so forth. When the man is bereft of
these rites, he becomes despised.

From this it is clear that even though the boy may have been
*initiated*, and as such become qualified for Vedic Study,—yet, if he is
bereft of the *Sāvitrī*, he becomes a ‘*Vrātya*,’ apostate.

What is meant by ‘*his own duty*’ is just that duty which is common to
the three castes; and this is the duty of Initiation. It is only when we
interpret it thus that the qualification ‘timely’ comes to have any
sense. If the ‘duty’ meant were the duties of Vedic Study and the rest,
the text would have said simply ‘performance of his own duty’ (without
the qualification ‘timely’).

The term ‘*yoni*’ being synonymous with ‘*birth*’ denotes *caste*. So
what is meant is the person of the Brāhmaṇa and other castes.

The present verse is only a descriptive supplement, added for the
purpose of making the Expiatory Rites prescribed for the *Vrātya*
(apostate) applicable to the omissions mentioned here.—(80)
