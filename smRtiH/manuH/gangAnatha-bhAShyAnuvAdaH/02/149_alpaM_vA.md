That teacher who *benefits* a pupil *means of knowledge*,—‘*more or*
*less*’—this is an adverb;—‘*him also*’—who helps with a little
knowledge only—‘*one should regard as the mentor*.’

The following construction is better:—‘*yasya śrutasya*’—these are in
apposition—*i.e*., of the knowledge of the Veda, or of the Vedic
subsidiaries, or of other Sciences, or of Reasoning and Art—*alpam vahu
vā*—*tena*—this has to be supplied—*upakaroti*’ \[The meaning, by this
construction being—‘that knowledge by a little or more of which he
benefits him, etc., etc.’\]

The word ‘*śrutopakriyayā*’ is an appositional compound the apposition
being based upon the fact of the ‘knowledge’ being the means of the
‘benefit.’

What is meant by this is that the teacher referred to should be called
and treated as a ‘mentor’: just as we haver had above in the case of the
terms ‘*Ācārya*’ and the rest.—(149)
