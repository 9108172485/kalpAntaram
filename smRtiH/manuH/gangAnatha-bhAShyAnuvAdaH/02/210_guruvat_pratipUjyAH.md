‘*The teacher’s ladies*’—wives—‘*belonging* *to the same caste*’—of the
same caste as the teacher,—‘*should be honoured like the teacher*’—by
carrying out their orders and so forth.

‘*Those not belonging to the same caste*’ are to be honoured only ‘*with
rising and salutations*.’ The plural number in ‘salutations’ has the
sense of ‘*et cetera*’: hence the doing of what is agreeable and
beneficial, the non-mimicking of gait, etc., also become included.—(210)
