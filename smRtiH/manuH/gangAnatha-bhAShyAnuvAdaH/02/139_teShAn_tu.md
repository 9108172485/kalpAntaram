‘*Among these, when they come together*,’—when they happen to
meet,—‘*the person just passed his studentship and the King deserve to
he honoured*’—by the ‘making of way,’ which is the particular form of
‘honouring’ mentioned in the present context.

‘*Receives the respects of the King*’—*i.e*., obtains honour from the
King.

The genitive case-ending has the sense of *selection* (according to
Pāṇini 2.3.41)

Among the rest—the person riding a chariot and others—there is option,
dependent upon their respective capacity.—(139)
