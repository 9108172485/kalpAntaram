The father, etc., have been called ‘gārhapatya’ and the rest by reason
of some sort of resemblance.

‘*This Triad* *of* *Fires*’—*i.e*., the three sacrificial Fires—‘*is
highly* *important*,’—*i.e*., conducive to great results.

The word ‘*treta*’ (*Triad*) is etymologically analysed as ‘*trāṇam
itā*’ which means ‘got up for the purposes of protection.’—(231)
