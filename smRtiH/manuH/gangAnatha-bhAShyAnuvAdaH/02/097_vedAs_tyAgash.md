The present verse is clearly injunctive.

‘*The Vedas*’—*i.e*., the study and recitation of them.

‘*Renunciation*’—means *charity*, figuratively; or, it may mean the
renouncing of the taking of even such meat and wine as are not
prohibited, under the impression that such abstention brings its own
reward.

He whose ‘*disposition*’—*i.e*., mind—‘*is vitiated*.’

‘*Never attain fulfilment*’—they do not bring about their due results,
at any time. From this it, follows that at the time of the performance
of the said acts, one should not allow his mind to turn towards objects
of sensuous enjoyment; for it is only thus that he may disregard all
other thoughts and concentrate his mind upon the act itself.

What this text enjoins is that one should avoid of all thought of
sensual objects,—this avoidance being a necessary accompaniment of all
acts; as in its absence the act becomes futile. The ‘vitiation of
disposition’ consists in the fact that at the time when the man is
engaged in the performance of an act, he ceases to have his mind
concentrated upon that act, and allows it to turn towards vice.—(97)
