“*Preceded by the syllable Oṃ*”—in the beginning of which the syllable
‘Oṃ’ occurs.—‘*Mahāvyāhṛtis*’;—this refers to the three syllables
‘*bhūḥ*—*bhuvaḥ*—*svaḥ*,’ which form the subject-matter of the present
context.

‘*Imperishable*’;—the syllables are so called in view of the fact that
the results proceeding from their repetition are longstanding. If this
were not meant, then the qualification would be superfluous, as all
words are equally imperishable, eternal.

*Three-footed Sāvitrī*;—the verse ‘*tat savituḥ*, *etc*.’

‘*The mouth of Brahman*.’—These are called ‘mouth’ in the sense that
they form its opening. Hence this verse is to be regarded as the
valedictory supplement of the Injunction that these should be recited at
the beginning of Vedic Study.

Or ‘mouth’ may mean *portal*, the means;—the sense being that *union
with Brahman* is reached by this means. This is what is described in the
next verse.—(81)
