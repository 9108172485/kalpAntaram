This injunction is meant for the Life-long Student.

In the absence of the Preceptor, he should continue to live in
residence, either with the Preceptor’s son, who is endowed with Vedic
learning and other qualities, or with the Preceptor’s widow, or with the
Preceptor’s ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’; and towards each of these he should behave as
towards his Preceptor; *i.e*., he should present to him the food he
obtains as alms, and so forth.

The term ‘*dārā*,’ denoting, has been regarded by grammarians as always
used with the plural ending; but writers on Smṛti use the singular form
also; *e.g*., ‘*Dharmaprajā-* *sampanne dāre nānyām kurvīta*’
(Āpaṣṭamba, 2.11.13).—(247)
