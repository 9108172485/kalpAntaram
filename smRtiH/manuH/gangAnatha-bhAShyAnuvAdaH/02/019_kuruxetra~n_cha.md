These are the names of the various regions.

‘*Kurukṣetra*’ is what is known as *Samantapañcaka*, the place where the
Kurus were exterminated. The etymological signification of the name
‘*Kurukṣetra* h as been explained as meaning—‘do good deeds here, and
salvation shall come quickly,’ ‘*kuru sukṛtamatra kṣiprantrāṇam
bhavati*.’

‘*Matsyas*’ and the rest are the names of countries, in the plural form.

‘*Brahmarṣideśa*’ is the name of the entire group. *Brahmāvarta* is the
country ‘created by the Gods’; and since the *Brahmarṣis* are a little
lower in degree than the Gods, this country, being related to
*Brahmarṣis*, is slightly lower in grade than *Brahmāvarta*. This is
what is meant by this being ‘*next to Brahmāvarta*,’—*i.e*., slightly
different from it;—the negative particle (in ‘*a* denoting *slightly*;
just as when it is said that ‘the sick person should drink gruel when it
is *not-hot*,’ it is meant that it should be drunk when it is *slightly
hot*. The term ‘*antara*’ means *different*; as it is found in such
assertions as ‘*mahadantaram*,’ ‘in the case of men, women and water,
even a slight difference makes a great difference.’ (19)
