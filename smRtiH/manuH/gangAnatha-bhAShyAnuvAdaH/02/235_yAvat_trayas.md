What is meant by this verse has already been explained.

‘*He should not do anything else*.’—Any other act leading to visible or
invisible results,—without their permission, as has already been stated
above (under 229).

‘*He should always render service unto them, rejoicing in what is
pleasing and beneficial to them*.’—What causes them pleasure is
‘pleasing,’ and what sustains them is ‘beneficial.’—(235)
