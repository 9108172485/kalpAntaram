What is stated here is on the understanding that there is no difference
between the cause and its effects.

‘*These have been declared to be the three regions*,’—because they are
the means by which one is enabled to reach the three regions.

‘*These the three life-stages*’—*i.e*., with the exception of *the
first*, that of the Religious Student. The meaning is that the reward
obtained by means of the three life-stages beginning with that of the
Householder is obtained if these three persons are satisfied.

‘*These the three Vedas*’;—because service of them brings the same
reward that is obtained by reciting the three Vedas.

‘*These the three Fires*’;—because the serving these brings the rewards
that are obtained by the performance of acts done with the help of the
three sacrificial fires.

This also is purely eulogistic.—(230)
