The arm should be raised, not only above the saered thread, but also out
of the upper garment.

The adverb ‘*always*’ is meant to imply that the arm is to be raised not
only while he is standing, nor only while he is reading, but on other
occasions also.

‘*Well-behaved*’;—he should have his behaviour—speech and other
acts—good, above reproach. The word ‘implies that even when not near the
Teacher, he should not utter indecorous words, or do any such wrongful
act.

‘*Well-guarded*’;—*i.e*., fully self-controlled, regarding speech, mind
and eyes,—he should avoid even the slightest defects. The man who
follows the bent of his desires (and does not restrain them) is called
among people ‘unguarded’; and the opposite of this is ‘*well-guarded*.’

Others explain this to mean that ‘near his Teacher one should keep his
body covered, and he should not take off his upper garment.’

In the manner thus described, ‘*he should stand*’ (as laid down in the
preceding verse); but when the Teacher says to him ‘*be seated*’—either
in so many words, or by the gesture of his brows, etc.; the function of
the injunction being to convey the direction, and this conveying need
not be done only by means of words,—‘*he should sit*.’

‘*Facing his Teacher*’—with his face towards the Teacher.—(198)
