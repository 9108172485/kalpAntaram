‘*Brother’s*’—should be understood to mean ‘of the elder brother.’

‘*Should be clasped in the feel*,’—should be saluted on their feet.

‘*Of the same caste*’—belonging to the same caste as her husband. As for
the brother’s wires who belong to the *Kṣatriya* and other castes, they
are to be treated as ordinary relatives.

‘*The wives of other paternal and maternal relatives*—*only when one has
gone on a journey*’;—*i.e*., by one who has *returned* from a journey;
for no clasping of the feet could be done by one who is away on a
journey.

‘*Jñāti*’ stands for paternal relatives;—‘*Sambandhi*’ for maternal
relatives; as also other relatives, such as the father-in-law and the
rest. The wives of these—when they are of older age; this is clear from
the fact that ‘the clasping of the feet’ is a form of worship which
cannot be right in the case of relatives of younger age.—(132)
