One since whose birth ten years have elapsed is ‘of ten years.’ The
*time* is the *determining* and the *Brāhmaṇa* the *determined* factor;
but it is not possible to determine, by means of *time*, either his
tallness or shortness or thinness, etc.; what can be determined by it is
only a certain act of his; and this act can only be that of *maintaining
his life-breath*, which subsists in him continuously since his birth.

The same explanation applies to the epithet ‘*of a* *hundred years*.’

They should be looked upon as ‘father and son.’

‘*Of the two*’—as compared with each other,—’ *the Brāhmaṇa is the
father*.’

All that this means is that even when the Kṣatriya is very old and the
Brāhmaṇa very young in years, the former should rise to meet and salute
the latter.—(135)
