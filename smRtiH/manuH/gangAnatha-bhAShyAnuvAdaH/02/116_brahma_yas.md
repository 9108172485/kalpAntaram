+++
When one is reciting the Veda with a view to getting up the text, or
when one is expounding the Veda to another person,—if some one were to
come by and acquire the Vedic text for the first time, or should
surreptitiously have bis own doubts (on some point connected with the
Vedic text) removed,—then to him occurs the sin here described; so long
as he does not secure the Teacher’s permission, preferring, his request
in such words as—‘just as these pupils are reading with you, so may I
also read, kindly accord me your permission.’ And it is only when the
pupil has received this permission that he should be taught. Otherwise,
the reading of the Veda would be like ‘*stealing*’; and the learner,
being *corrupted with this sin of stealing the Veda, falls into
hell*—*i.e*., into a place of condign punishment.

The ablative ending in ‘*adhīyānāt*,’ ‘*from* *one who is, reciting
it*,’ is according to Pāṇini 1.4.29, according to which ‘the source of
proper instruction is put in the Ablative’;—or the Ablative may have the
sense of *separation*,—separation being implied by the fact that the
teaching appears to *issue from* the Teacher;—or the Ablative may have
the sense of the participle, being used in place of the affix ‘*lyap*,’
the meaning being—‘he learns after *having heard* another person who is
reciting it.’—(116)
