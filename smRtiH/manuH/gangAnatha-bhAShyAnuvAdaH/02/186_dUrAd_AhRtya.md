The term ‘*distance*’ is meant to stand for such plots of land as are
not owned by any one; for instance, the forest is ‘distant’ from the
village, and it is not owned by any one. If such were not the meaning,
and ‘distance’ simply meant ‘remote places,’—then since the exact degree
of remoteness is not specified, the manning of the injunction would
remain indefinite.

‘*Having fetched*’—having brought.

‘*Should place*’—should keep.

‘*In the air*’—*i.e*., on the roof of the house; no placing is possible
in the open air, without some support.

‘*With* *these* *he should make offerings morning and evening*.’

The fetching of the fuel may he at that or at any other time, according
as the student pleases.

Some people regard the ‘placing in the air’ as serving some
transcendental purpose. Others have however held that the fuel brought
fresh from the tree is wet; and hence it is necessary to place it either
on the top of the house or on that of a wall, etc. (for the purpose of
drying).—(186)
