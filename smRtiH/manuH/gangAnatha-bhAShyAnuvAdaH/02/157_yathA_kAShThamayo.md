This verse praises learning and the learner.

‘*Made of wood*’;—the form of the elephant made of wood by means of the
said and other implements; just as this is useless, does not serve any
useful purpose for the king, in the shape of killing his enemies and so
forth,—so the Brāhmaṇa who does not learn is like a piece of wood, not
fit for anything.

‘*The deer made of leather*’;—similarly the deer that has been made out
of leather is useless; it is of no use for purposes of limiting, etc.

‘*These three only bear their names*’—and do not fulfil what is
signified by these names.—(157)
