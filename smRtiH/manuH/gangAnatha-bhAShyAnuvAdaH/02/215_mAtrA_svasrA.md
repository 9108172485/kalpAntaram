For reasons above described ‘*one should not sit alone*’—in a solitary
room, etc., one should not sit; nor should he touch the body, etc.
Because the host of sense-organs is extremely fickle; and it
‘*overpowers*’—draws, makes helpless —‘*even the learned*’—*i.e*., the
person who has his mind fully controlled by wisdom acquired from the
scriptures.—(215)
