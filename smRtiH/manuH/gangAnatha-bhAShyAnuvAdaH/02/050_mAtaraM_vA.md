The words ‘mother,’ etc., have their meanings well known;—‘*own*’
uterine.

‘*As may not* *insult* *him*’—‘insulting’ here means *disregard*;
*i.e*., refusal—‘I shall give nothing.’ Says the *Gṛhya* *sūtra*—‘He
should beg from such man or woman as may not refuse him.’

What is meant here by ‘*first*’ is the begging that is done by the boy
during Initiation. In the course of the subsequent daily bogging, he
should not fear refusal.—(50)
