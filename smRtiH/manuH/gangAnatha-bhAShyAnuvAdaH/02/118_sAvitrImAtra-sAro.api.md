This verse is in praise of the rules regarding Salutation, etc.

He for whom the *Sāvitrī* is the sole essence, his all in all, is called
‘*Sāvitrīmātrasāraḥ*,’ ‘*knowing the Sāvitrī alone*.’

‘*Better*’—Superior;—‘*the* *Brāhmaṇa*,’ if he is thoroughly *self-*
*Controlled*, *i.e*., who governs himself entirely in accordance with
the scriptures.

One who is ‘*not sell-controlled*,’ ‘*though the three Vedas*’—fully
conversant with the scriptures.

‘*Eats all things*,’—things even though not actually prohibited, yet
against custom and usage.

Similarly ‘*sells all* *things*’—‘Selling’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration, it stands for all that is prohibited.

The meaning of all this is ns that one becomes as much open to censure
by omitting to rise to receive the teacher and other practices ns he is
by the omission of other rules of conduct.

*Objection*.—“How is it that wè have the form ‘*varam* (neuter) *vipraḥ*
(masculine)’; the correct form would be ‘*varo vipraḥ*’ (both
masculine).”

In answer to this some people say that the phrase opens with the general
and ends with the particular: the construction being—‘*It is
better*,’—“What is better?”—‘that the Brāhmaṇa be self-controlled.’

Others however explain that the term ‘*vara*’ has no particular gender
of its own; and it is used in the neuter gender also.—(118)
