The ‘*habit of saluting*’ stands, not only for the uttering of words of
salute, but for the act of addressing all men with respect and in the
proper manner. The term ‘*habit*’ indicates that the man does it without
any personal motive at all.

‘*Constantly reveres elders*’—by talking agreeably, and also attends
upon them with such service as he can render.

‘*For him four things prosper*—*longevity, merit*’—which is the tree
that hears fruit in the other world, in the shape of Heaven,—‘*fame and
strength*’—as described above.

Though this verse is purely valedictory, yet it serves to afford some
idea as to the effects that ensue.—(121)
