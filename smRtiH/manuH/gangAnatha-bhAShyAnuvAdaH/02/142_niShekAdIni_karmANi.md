The mention of the ‘Rites of Impregnation’ indicates that the present
verse lays down the fact of the Father being a ‘Mentor.’

‘*Niṣeka*’ ‘Impregnation,’ is the ‘Sprinkling of the semen’:—those acts
of which the ‘Impregnation’ is the first or beginning; the term
‘beginning’ shows that all the Sacramental Rites are meant.

He who performs these rites and also ‘*supports*’—fosters—‘*with food*.’

‘*Chaivainam*’ is another reading (for ‘*cānnena*’). The meaning remains
the same; as ‘supporting’ can be done only by means of *food*. The only
additional sense obtained from this other reading is the reference, by
means of the pronoun ‘*enam*,’ to the boy.

“As a matter of fact, ‘*enam* is only a relative pronoun; and the ‘Boy’
does not appear anywhere here as its antecedent.”

There is no force in this; for whom else (if not for the *boy*) are the
Kites of Impregnation and the rest performed? And ‘reference’ is often
only *implied*, not always expressly stated.

He who does not fulfil these two conditions, but gives one birth, is
only a ‘progenitor,’ not a ‘mentor.’ Nor should the notion be
entertained that, not being a ‘mentor,’ he should not be respected; as a
matter of fact, he is the very first to deserve respect; as says the
revered Vyāsa—‘The Father is the master, the source of the body, the
benefactor, the life-giver, the mentor, the advisor, of all that is
good, the visible God.’

The mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ is only illustrative.—(142)
