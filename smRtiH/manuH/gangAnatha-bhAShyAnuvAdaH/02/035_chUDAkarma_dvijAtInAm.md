‘*Cūḍā*’ is the tuft of hair on the crown of the bead’; and the ceremony
for the purpose of this is called ‘**Cū*ḍākarman*,’ ‘*Tonsure*’; this
name ‘Tonsure’ is given to that ceremony which consists in the cutting
of the hair in such a manner as to leave well-arranged tufts of hair on
certain parts of the head.

This may be done ‘*in the first year or the third*’;—this option being
due to considerations of the good and evil aspects of planets.

‘*In view of the injunctions of the Veda*’:—this is merely explanatory:
the fact of the entire contents of the work being based upon the Veda
having been already stated before. Or, the term may he taken here as not
necessarily standing for the injunctive texts, but including the Mantras
also; and as a matter of fact, we have the *mantra*, ‘*yatkṣureṇa
mārjayet, etc*.,’ (*Pāraskara-gṛhyasūtra*, 2.1.1), which is indicative
of the Tonsure-ceremony, in the same manner as the *Mantra* ‘*yāñjanā
pratinandanti, etc*.,’ (*Pāraskara*,—3.2.2) indicates the
*Aṣṭakā-rites*. So that what the phrase means is that the ceremony
should be performed with *mantras*. As to the particular details
(regarding the *mantras*, etc.), these are learnt from the *Gṛyhasūtra*.

From this it follows that this sacrament is not to he done for the
*Śūdra*; which is also clear from the mention of the ‘*twice-born*.’ As
for the *shaving of hair* without any restriction as to time, this is
done for special purposes, and may he done for the Śūdra also: this is
not interdicted.—(35)
