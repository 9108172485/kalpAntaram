This enumeration of the organs is as laid down in other sources of
information; and the present text is not intended to lay down the number
of organs. The description is provided by our author only on account of
his good will towards his audience. The organs have been *named by the
ancient sages*; and I shall now describe their names and also their
function.

‘*In due order*.’— Implies *absence of confusion*.

The reference to the ‘*ancient sages*’ is meant to indicate that the
enumeration of the organs is not something invented by the logicians, it
was something already known among the ancient teachers. In fact, people
not knowing this are ridiculed by men as ‘not learned in the
scriptures’; hence these should be properly understood.

The meaning of the words of the text are well known, and have been
already explained.—(89)
