When the student goes to beg for food, or when the teacher is teaching
at home for livelihood,—if he fails to win reverence, he should not
allow his mind to be perturbed by it; on the other hand, ‘*he should
shrink from reverence*’; *i.e*, if what is given to him is given with
due respect, he should not regard it as sufficient (simply on that
account).

‘Like nectar,’ ‘*he should a* *lways* *seek for
disrespect*,’—ill-treatment. The genitive ending has been used (in
‘*avamānusya*’) by imposing upon the root ‘*ākāṅkṣa*’ the sense of the
root ‘*iṅ*’ with the preface ‘*aḍhi*,’ *i.e*., the sense of *thinking
of*; and thus bringing it under Pāṇini’s sūtra 2.3.52, by which the root
‘*iṅ*’ with ‘*aḍhi*,’ governs the genitive. It is on the basis of this
similarity that ‘anxiety’ is present in both (*desire* and *thought*).

“But what is not offered with respect should not be eaten.”

True; but what the present verse does is to prohibit the perturbation of
mind; and.it does not mean tbat food offered with disrespect should be
eaten. The sense of all this is that one should look equally upon
respect and disrespect; and not that he should actually hanker after
disrespect.

Further, the Religious Student may accept even such food as is offered
with disrespect; for it is not a regular gift, and hence, does not come
under 4.235, where the receiving of gifts offered without respect is
decried.—(163)
