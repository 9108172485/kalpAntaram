That pupil whom thou knowest to be ‘*pure*’
‘*self-controlled*’—*i.e*.,having full control over his senses; and *a
‘qualified student*,’ ever attentive ;—‘*unto him expound me*.’ He who
*guards his treasures*, being never careless; he never commits mistakes,
never fails, being ever attentive to his business.

What is deduced from this valedictory description is the advice that
learning should be imparted to the pupils already described above as
qualified (under 109), only when they fulfil the conditions described in
the present verse.—(115)
