‘*Honoured*’—respected. The mention of ‘honouring’ indicates that the
person honoured is intent upon repaying the benefits he has received. As
a matter of fact, the person who is honoured becomes pleased and tries
to repay it. Or, ‘*honoured*’ may be taken as standing for ‘pleased.’
And as Duties are endless, the entire satisfaction of these would not be
possible; so that what is indicated is ‘anxiety to bring about the
desired result’; hence what is meant is that ‘all acts done by him bear
fruit quickly.’

‘*By him who has honoured these three*’—who has satisfied them by his
service.

If these persons are not honoured, then whatever meritorious act the man
does with a view to reward remains fruitless.

‘*All acts*’,—*i.e*., rites performed according to *Śrauta and Smārta*
rules.

This verse is purely commendatory. The fact of the matter is that the
injunction of honouring the three persons aims at the accomplishment of
something desirable for man; so that by transgressing it the man would
incur a great sin, which would obstruct the fulfilment of any reward
that he might have won by his acts. It is with a view to this that it is
said that ‘*all his acts remain fruitless*.’—(234)
