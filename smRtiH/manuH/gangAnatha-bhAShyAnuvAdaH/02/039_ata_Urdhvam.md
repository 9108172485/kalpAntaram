‘*Beyond*’—after—the said time, ‘*all* *these three*’ castes—the
Brāhmaṇa and the rest;—‘*at the proper time*’—at the exact time
prescribed for each caste, or even at the secondary period
permitted;—‘*not having received the sacrament*’—not having their
*Upanayana-* ceremony performed;—‘*excluded from Sāvitrī*’—become fallen
off from Initiation; and also ‘*come to he known as
Vrātyas*’—‘*despised*,’ looked down upon, ‘by *all good men*’ by
respectable and cultured people.

This verse is intended to explain the signification of the well known
name ‘*Vrātya*’ That they become excluded from Initiation has already
been implied in the preceding verse.

It has been said that they ‘are despised by good men’; the next verse
explains the nature of contempt in which they are held.—(39)
