‘*Non-existence*’ may mean either *death*, or absence of proper
qualification.

‘*When all these are non-existent*,’ *he should carry on the tending of
the fire,—i.e*., he should continue to wash and besmear with clay the
fire-house, he should kindle the fire, he should constantly keep near
the Fire, just as his Preceptor used to do;—all this constitutes the
‘tending of the fire.’ While doing all this, ‘*he should perfect his
body*’—*i.e*., let it wear away; this is called ‘*perfecting*’ in the
same manner (of contrary signification) as the blind man is described as
‘having excellent eyes.’

‘*Sthānāsanavihāravān*’—‘*with only such diversion as standing and
sitting*’; *i.e*., he should amuse himself only by standing for sometime
and sitting for sometime.

Others have explained this to mean that he ‘should sit in the proper
posture for meditation’—such as the *Svasti(k/h?*) and the rest—‘and
should go about begging alms.’—(248)
