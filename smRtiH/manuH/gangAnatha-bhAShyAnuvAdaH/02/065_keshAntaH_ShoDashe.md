‘*Keśānta*—Hair-clipping. is—the name of a particular sacrament. This
sacrament should be done, for the Brāhmaṇa, in his sixteenth year, from
conception. For a knowledge of the exact form of this sacrament our only
source is the Gṛhyasūtra.

‘*Two years later*’—*i.e*., in the year, which is two years later than
the twenty-second. Or, the compound may be taken as qualifying ‘time,’
so that the meaning is—‘at the time which comes two years later than the
twenty-second,’—‘*for the Vaiśya*.’ The numeral adjective ‘two’ must be
taken as qualifying *years*; as the whole verse refers to *years*.—(65)
