‘*Among these*’—above-mentioned births;—that which is ‘*Brahmic
birth*’—i .*e*., U panayana—‘*which is marked by the tying of the*
*girdle*,’—which is symbolised by the tying of the girdle made of
*Muñja-grass*; at this ‘*Sāvitrī is his mother*,’—*i.e*., it becomes
accomplished by the expounding of the Sāvitrī-mantra. This shows that in
the whole Upanayana ceremony, the expounding of the *Sāvitrī* is the
most important factor; it is for this purpose that the child is ‘brought
near’ (*upa-nīyate*). ‘*The Teacher is his father*.’

Birth is always brought about by the Father and Mother; hence
metaphorically the Teacher and the Sāvitrī hare, been described as
‘father’ and ‘mother.’—(170)

The Upanayana has been described as ‘*marked by the tying of the
Girdle*’; and this might be understood to mean that it is on acoount of
tying the girdle that the Teacher is to be honoured like the father;
hence the next verse is added
