It should not be thought that the person who has full control over his
organs and who is fully aware that even locking at the Teacher’s wife
with impure motives is a heinous offence, incurs no danger by touching
her feet. Because so far as women are concerned, the person cognisant of
the grievousness of the sin, as well as the person not so cognisant,
both are equal; for no amount of learning is any use in this matter;
women are capable of leading astray—on the wrong path, contrary to usage
and scriptures—all men.

‘*Who becomes a servile follower of desire and passion*,’—Who becomes
contaminated with desire and passion. This epithet only serves to
indicate a particular condition of man. Barring the too young and too
old, and one who has reached the highest stage of Yoga, there is no one,
with the exception of one who has entirely destroyed his human
susceptibilities, who is not attracted by women, just as iron is
attracted by the magnet. This is not due to any powerful influence
intentionally exercised; it is in the very nature of things that at the
sight of a young woman, the mind of man becomes upset, specially that of
young students.—(214)
