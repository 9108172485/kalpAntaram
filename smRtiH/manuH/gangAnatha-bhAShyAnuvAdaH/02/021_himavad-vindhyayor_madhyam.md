On the north lies the Himālaya and on the south the Vindhya.
‘*Vinaśana*’ is the name of the place where the Sarasvatī river has
disappeared.—(20)

‘*Prayāga*’—is the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā.

The region having these four as its boundaries is to be known by the
name ‘*Madhya-deśa*.’ It is called ‘*madhya*’ or ‘middle,’ because it is
neither very superior nor very inferior,—and *not* because it is located
*the centre* of the Earth.—(21)
