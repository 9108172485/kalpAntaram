‘*This region*;’—*i.e*., the Earth; the Mother being equal to the Earth,
on account of both of them being capable of bearing burdens.

‘*By devotion to his* *Father*, *the middle region*;’—*i.e*., the sky.
The Father has been described as Prajāpati; and according to the
followers of the Nirukta, Prajāpati has his abode in the middle Region;
and he is the sustainer or protector of men.

‘*The Region of Brahman*’—*i.e*., the solar region; according to the
declaration (in the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad*) that ‘the Sun is Brahman, such
is the teaching.’

‘*Region*’—means a particular place.

‘*Acquires*’—gains.

All this is a purely commendatory statement; and much attention need not
be paid to it. Nor is it that only persons desirous of sovereignty over
the said regions are to do honour to the Rather, etc.; for the
injunction is not an optional one. In fact, the mere fact of the person
being one’s father is the sole condition of his being honoured; and the
omission of it involves a transgression of the scriptures.—(233)
