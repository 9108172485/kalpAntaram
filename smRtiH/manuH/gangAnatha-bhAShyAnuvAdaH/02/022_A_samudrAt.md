The country that lies between the two limits of the Eastern and Western
Oceans,—and between the two mountains spoken of in the preceding
verse,—*i.e*., the Himālaya and the Vindhya,—is described as
‘*Āryāvarta*,’ ‘*by the learned*,’—*i.e*., by cultured people. It is
called ‘*Āryāvarta*’ in the sense that the *Āryas line there* (‘*Āryāḥ
vartante tatra*’); *i.e*., it is they that are born there again and
again, and the Barbarians, even though attacking it repeatedly, do not
remain there.

The particle ‘*āṅ*’ (in ‘*āsamudrāt*’) indicates the *outer* not the
*inner* boundary, and it does not indicate *inclusion*. Hence the
islands in the oceans do not come under ‘*Āryāvarta*.’

What are mentioned here are the four boundaries of the country: the
Eastern Ocean on the east, the Western Ocean on the west, the Hiṁālaya
on the north and the Vindhya on the south.

In as much as these two mountains have been mentioned as ‘boundaries,’
they are not included under ‘*Āryāvarta*’; from this people might be led
to conclude that one should not inhabit these mountains. And with a view
to (avoiding) this possibility, the Author adds the next verse.—(22)
