‘*Pāratryam*’—‘*that which is done for the sake of another life*’—is
that act whose reward is obtained during the next birth. The form of
this word is Vedic.

Whatever religious act he should do, apart from the serving of them,
without causing them trouble,—of all that he should inform them; he
should make it known to them.

The qualification ‘*without injury to*’ has been added with a view to
convey the following idea:—One should, not

press them to permit the performance of an act that may be injurious to
them. It sometimes happens that a simple-minded person, when pressed,
permits the doing of an act, not minding the harm that it may do him,
and the present verse is meant to prohibit this.

‘*By thought*, *word or deed*.’—This communication is not for the
purpose of accomplishing some unseen result. The meaning is that he
should show by his actual deed that he has acted in strict accordance
with the permission accorded to him.

Or, the verse may be construed as—‘whatever act for the sake of the next
life he does, by thought word or deed, that he should make known to
them.’—(236)
