The present verse is commendatory of the injunction contained in the
preceding verse, and it serves the purpose of indicating the result
proceeding from what has been enjoined.

He who is not perturbed by dishonour or scorn ‘*sleeps in comfort*’:
otherwise he would be burning with resentment and would not get any
sleep; and on waking up, he would still be thinking of the dishonour,
and would find no comfort. On rising from sleep, he moves about his
business in comfort.

That person however who has done the scorning perishes by that very
sin.—(163)
