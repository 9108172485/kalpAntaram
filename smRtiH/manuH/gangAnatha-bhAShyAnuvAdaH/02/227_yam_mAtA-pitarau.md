This is another commendatory statement describing a past event.

‘*Trouble*’—pain;—‘*Parents*’–‘father and mother’;—‘*of children*’—of
their offsprings. ‘*At the birth*’—from conception up to the tenth year
of their age. The ‘trouble’ of the mother consists in the bearing of the
child in the womb; then again, parturition endangers the very life of
women. After the birth of the child, there follows the trouble of
rearing him; all this is known by all persons in their own experience.
For the father also there is ‘trouble’ beginning with *Upanayana* and
ending in the explanation of the meaning of Vedic texts.

The term ‘*birth*’ here cannot mean *conception*; as this act entails no
trouble at all; what are meant are all the acts that follow the act of
*conceiving*, all which are troublesome.

‘*For that*’—trouble—‘*there can be no compensation*’—payment of the
debt; the repayment of the benefits conferred; this cannot be done
‘*even in a hundred years*’—*i.e*., even during several lives; what to
say of a single life! There may be some compensation for parents if one
presents them with innumerable wealth or saves them from a very great
calamity.—(227)
