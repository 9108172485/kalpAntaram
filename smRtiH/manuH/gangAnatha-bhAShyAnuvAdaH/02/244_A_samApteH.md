This verse lays down the reward of Life-long Studentship.

‘*Dissolution of the body*’—renouncing of life;—‘*till*’—up to that
time;—‘*who serves*’—attends upon—‘*his Teacher*’;—such a
Brāhmaṇa—‘*goes*’ to the ‘*abode*’—place, mansion—‘*of
Brahman*’—‘*eternal*’;—*i.e*., he does not return again to the cycle of
births.

‘*Forthwith*,’—*i.e*., by an easy path; not by the roundabout way of
passing through the lives of animals and men.

The word ‘*Brahman*’ here stands, according to the view of the Purāṇas,
for the particular God with four faces; and his ‘*abode*’ is a
particular place in Heaven; while according to the Vedanta standpoint,’
‘*Brahman*’ is the supreme Self, and his ‘*abode*’ is that Self itself,
*i.e*., becoming absorbed hereinto.—(244)
