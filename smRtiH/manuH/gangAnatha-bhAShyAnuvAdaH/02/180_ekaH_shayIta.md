‘*He should always sleep alone*; *nowhere should he allove his manhood
to run out*,’—*i.e*., not even outside; intercourse with women having
been already prohibited.

Next follows a commendatory statement—‘*Intentionally, etc*.’
‘*Intention*’ means *wish*...... By allowing his manhood to run—by any
means—he ‘*breaks*’—destroys—‘*his* *vow*’ of studentship
(continence).—(180)
