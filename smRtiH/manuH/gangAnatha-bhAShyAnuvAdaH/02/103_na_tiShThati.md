+++
The present verse, describing the evil accruing from the non-performance
of the Twilight-Prayers, serves to emphasise the compulsory character of
these.

He who does not keep standing during the morning-twilight and who does
not keep seated during the evening-twilight, should be regarded as a
*Śūdra*.

‘*From all that is due to twice-born persons*’;—*i.e*., entertaining as
a guest, honouring, offering of gifts and so forth.—‘*He should be
excluded*,’—*i.e*., discarded.

For this reason, in order to avoid being treated as a *Śūdra* one should
observe the Twilight Prayers every day.

This verse also points out the motive behind the performance; and
*standing* and *seating* during the repeating of the *Sāvitrī* are the
acts enjoined in the present context; and that act is to be regarded as
of primary importance with which the motive happens to be connected; so
that all the rest of what is said in the present connection is only
subsidiary and of secondary importance.—(103)
