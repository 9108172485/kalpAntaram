The terra ‘cart’ is connected with each of the foregoing terras; and the
cart yoked with, drawn by, oxen (), ‘horses’ (‘*aśva*’) and ‘camels’
(*uṣṭra*) is called ‘*gośvoṣṭvayānam?*’; the terra ‘*yukta*’ (‘yoked,’
‘drawn by’) being dropped, as in the word ‘*dadhighāṭa*’ (‘curd-jar’).
That this is so is clear from the fact that it is not possible for two
men to ride together on the hare back of the ox, etc. If we had the word
‘*yāna*’ standing by itself, then we might have taken the verse itself
as permitting the riding along with the teacher on the bare back of the
ox, etc. In some places we do find this to he permitted by usage.

‘*Terrace*,’—the surface on the top of houses; and in such places
sitting with the Teacher is as possible as on the floor of houses.

‘*Grass-mats*’—beds made of grass and leaves, etc.

‘*Reed-mats*’—beds made of reeds and sticks.

‘*Bocks*’—stone-slabs either on the top of hills or elsewhere.

‘*Benches*’—scats made of wood, called ‘*pota*,’ ‘*varta*,’ etc.

‘*Boats*’;—*i.e*., contrivances for floating on water, which would
include rafts and other similar things.—(204)
