The ‘clasping of the Teacher’s feet’ mentioned in the preceding verse
‘*should be done with crossed hands*.’

In answer to the question as to what sort of the ‘crossing’ of hands
should be done, the Author adds—‘*the left*’ foot ‘*should be touched
with the left*’ hand; it is mere touching that should be done, the
Teacher should not be troubled by the foot being held for a long time.
This ‘crossing’ is obtained by the two hands being simultaneously moved
towards one another. That is, the feet having to be clasped by the pupil
standing in front of the Teacher; the left hand is moved towards the
right and the right towards the left; it is thus that the left foot
becomes touched by the left hand and the right foot by the right hand.
This is the ‘crossing of the hands.’

Others read the text as ‘*vinyastapāṇinā*,’ ‘with well-placed hands.’
The ‘placing’ being implied by the *touching*, what the addition of the
epithet would imply is that the feet should not be touched merely with
the finger tips,—in the way in which a red-hot piece of iron is touched,
for fear of burning,—but the hands should be ‘well-plaed,’ actually held
upon the feet. Pressing of the feet would cause pain to the Teacher, and
is as such prohibited. Such is the explanation provided of this version
of the text.—(72)
