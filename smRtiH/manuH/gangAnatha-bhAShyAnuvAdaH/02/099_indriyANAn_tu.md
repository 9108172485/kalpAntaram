\[In the term ‘*indriyāṇāṃ*’\] the Genitive has the force of
specification.

If even *one* *organ* *happens to ooze out*;—*i.e*., if on functioning
freely in regard to its object, it is not checked,—then ‘*his wisdom
oozes out*’;—*i.e*., his steadiness in regard to the other organs also
(disappears).

‘*Leathern bag*’;—a vessel for carrying water, made of the skin of the
goat and other animals. Even though all the other parts of this bag be
closed, if water trickles out of a single part of it, the whole bag
becomes empty.

In the same manner, the man’s steadiness acquired through continuous
practice of wisdom,—or even true wisdom and knowledge itself—(becomes
entirely lost). That is, being addicted to several objects, he has his
mind always turned towards them, so that the subjects dealt with by
reasonings and scriptures do not present themselves to him in the right
manner.—(99)
