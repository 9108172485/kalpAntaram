The particle ‘*iti*’ (‘*all*’)denotes the end, and signifies entirety.

Whatever there is that ought to be done by man, whatever there is that
is conducive to the fulfilment of man’s purpose,—all that is
‘*finished*’—becomes entirely accomplished—‘on *these three*’ being duly
propitiated.

‘*This is the highest* *duty*,’—because ‘*direct*.’

‘*Every other*,’ duty in the form of *Agnihotra* and the rest—is
‘*subordinate*.’ That is, they are like the door-keeper (leading up to
the king), and not directly like the king himself. This is a praise (of
the act of serving the father, etc.).

The prohibition of disregarding them,—the injunction of doing what is
pleasing and beneficial to them,—of not doing what may be injurious to
them,—and the non-doing of acts not injurious to them, without their
permission apart from these, all the other verses are merely
commendatory.—(237)
