This is another eulogy of the teacher.

‘*Hāyana*’ is synonymous with ‘*samvatsara*,’ ‘years.’ One does not
become *great*—venerable—by being advanced in age by many years;—‘*nor
by grey hair*’—*i.e*., by the hairs of the head and beard becoming
white;—‘*nor by (much) wealth*’;—‘*nor by relatives*,’—does one acquire
the aforesaid title to respect. One does not become ‘great’ even by all
these taken together; but by *learning* alone. And this because ‘*the
sages have made the law*,’—‘*Ṛṣi*,’ ‘*sage*,’ is so called by reason of
his sublime vision. The meaning is that the ‘seers’ of the text and
meaning of the entire Veda, have come to the conclusion and laid down
this law—‘*he who teaches*’—‘teaching’ means instructing in the Veda
along with all its subsidiaries—‘*is the greatest*’—most
venerable—‘*among us*.’

The term ‘*made*’ stands for *laying* not for bringing into existence
what did not exist before.—(154)
