title = "004 अकामस्य क्रिया"

The preceding verse has described the fact that such activity and
cessation from activity as are laid down in the scriptures are dependent
upon knowledge; and the present verse speaks of similar dependence in
the case of ordinary acts of the world; this is the difference between
the two verses.

‘*Iha*’ means ‘in this world’;—‘*Karhichit*’ means ‘ever,’ ‘at any
time.’ During the waking state, *action is ever found in this world* to
be done by any person who is without desire for performing that action.

Whatever act, scriptural or temporal,—the permitted or the prohibited—is
done *is the outcome of desire*. Since desire is the cause of all
activity, every act is called the ‘outcome of desire.’

Thus the position becomes extremely difficult: ‘It is not right to be
absorbed in desires’ (as declared in Verse 2), and yet there is no
activity without desire.—(4)
