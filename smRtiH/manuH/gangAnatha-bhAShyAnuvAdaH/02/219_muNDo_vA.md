‘*Muṇḍaḥ*’—means that he should shave the whole of his head.

‘*Jaṭilaḥ*’—one who has hairs *braided, i.e*., inextricably sticking to
one another.

Or one whose ‘*śikhā*’ top-hair,’ only is braided; and the rest of the
head is shaven.

And he should so behave himself that the sun does not set while he is
still in the village; ‘*village*’ here includes the town also. The
meaning is that at the time of sun-set he should betake himself to the
forest. Similarly the sun should not rise while he is in the village;
that is, for the Religious Student, sun-rise also should take place
while he is in the forest.

‘*Enam*’—refers to the Religious Student.

Others have explained this to mean that ‘the Sun should not set while he
is still addicted to the vulgar acts of sleeping and the like.’ To this
same effect we have the term ‘sleeping’ in the next verse. Under this
explanation what the verse prohibits is sleeping during the two
twilights; and it does not mean that he should be actually in the forest
at those times; for the Student would be still too young and would be
frightened (by being in the forest at twilight). In fact Gautama (9.10)
has declared that the twilights should be spent outside the village
after the ‘*Godāna*’ ceremony; and this ceremony is laid down as to be
performed in the sixteenth year; and arrived at that age, the student
can, if he reaches the forest, offer his twilight prayers there.—(219)
