done; and after having tied the girdle, the Initiation should be
performed; the staff is taken up after the ‘sacred thread’ ceremony has
been performed. After the staff has been taken up, the Sun should be
worshipped; *i.e*., one should stand facing the sun and worship Him with
those Mantras of which the sun is the presiding deity; what are the
particular Mantras to be employed can be ascertained from the
*Gṛhyasūtras*; as also the other details of procedure.

‘*Having walked round the* *fire* *to his right*,’—having passed all
round it.

‘*Gharet*’—(lit.) should accomplish;—‘*alms*’ is a collective term,
stauding for collection of fool;—this he ‘*should beg*.’

‘*According to prescribed rule*’—refers to the rules going to be laid
down below. The term ‘*bhikṣū*’ (food) stands for small quantities of
cooked rice, etc.—(18)
