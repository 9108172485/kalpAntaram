The *Ear* and the rest are well known. We have ‘*Eyes*’ in the Dual, in
view of the two different *substrata* (of the Visual Organ); in other
places we have the singular number in view of the fact that the
*Faculty* itself, subsisting in the said substrata, is *one* only.

The ‘*Generative Organ*,’—the organ secreting the semen (in males), and
the ovule and its receptacle (in females).

‘*Hands and feet*’—‘*Hastapādam*’;—the copulative compound has been put
in the singular number according to Pāṇini 2. 4. 2, by which copulative
compounds consisting of terras expressive of limbs of living beings are
put in the singular.

‘*Speech*’ here stands for that part of the body which consists of the
Palate and the rest, and serve to manifest sound.

This verse mentions the names (of Organs).—(90)
