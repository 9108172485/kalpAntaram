‘*In the presence of his Teacher*’—*he* should eat—‘*inferior*’—*i.e*.,
less—‘*food*.’This ‘inferiority’ of the food may be sometimes in
*quantity*, and sometimes in *quality*; that is to say, if he happen to
obtain as alms such food as is richly cooked and mixed with butter, milk
and vegetables, then he should not eat it,—if his Teacher has already
eaten food of not the same quality, or when he is eating with his
Teacher, or if equally rich food has not been prepared in the Teacher’s
house. If similar food has been got ready for the Teacher, then he
should reduce the food he himself eats.

As regards dress, if the Teacher’s happens to be woolen, the pupil
should wear cotton.

‘*Apparel*’—ornaments, toilette, etc. This also should be inferior.

‘*Always*’—*i.e*., even after the period of studentship. It is in view
of this that ‘apparel’ has been added; for the Religious Student there
could be no adornment, etc.

‘*He should rise before him*’—*i.e*., from the bed, at the end of night;
or from the seat, after he has understood that it is time for the
Teacher to rise; he should rise before his Teacher.

‘*He should go to sleep*’—retire to bed, or take his
seat—‘*later*’—*i.e*., after the Teacher has gone to sleep.—(194)
