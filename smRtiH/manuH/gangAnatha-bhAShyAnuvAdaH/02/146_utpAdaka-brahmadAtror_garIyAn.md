‘*Progenitor*’—is one who gives natural birth; ‘*Imparter of the Veda*’
is one who teaches;—both these are ‘*fathers*’; and between these two
‘fathers,’ that Father is ‘*more venerable*’ who imparts the Veda. So
that when the Father and the Preceptor are both present, the Preceptor
should be saluted first.

The text adds a valedictory statement in support of what has been
said—‘*The Brāhmaṇa’s birth is the Veda*’; *i.e*., is for the purpose of
learning the Veda; the compound ‘*brahmajanma*’ being expounded as
‘*brahmagrahaṇārtham janma*,’ according to the *Vārtika* on ‘Pāṇini’
2.1.60. According to this explanation of the compound, the Initiatory
Rite would be ‘the birth for the learning of the Veda.’ Or, the compound
‘*brahmajanma*’ may be explained as ‘birth consisting in the form of
learning the Veda.’

This, for the Brāhmaṇa, is *eternally*—ever—*beneficial*—‘*here*’ and
‘*beneficial after death*’ also.—(110)
