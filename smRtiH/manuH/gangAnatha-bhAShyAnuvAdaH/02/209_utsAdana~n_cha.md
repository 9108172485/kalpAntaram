‘*Shampooing*’—rubbing after oiling—he shall not do.

‘*Washing of his feet*’ also he shall not do;—for the teacher’s son.

It is from this prohibition that it follows that, even though not
directly enjoined, these acts should be done for the teacher. When
however the teacher’s son himself becomes the teacher, by becoming fully
equipped to teach the entire Veda,—then the eating of the food left by
him, etc., come to be done for his own sake; and the present prohibition
does not apply to the acts under such circumstances. For their
prohibition refers to what is due to the son, through the injunction
transferring to him the treatment accorded to the teacher,—and not to
what would be due to him by direct injunction.—(209)
