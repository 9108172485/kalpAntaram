The author now proceeds to describe the functions of the organs, with a
view to determine their precise nature. \[This is necessary, because\]
they are not perceptible.

‘*Organs of Sensation*’;—*i.e*., the organs productive of sensation;
they bring about effects in the form of sensations. The Genitive (in the
compound ‘*buddhīndriyāṇāṃ*’) denotes the relation of cause and effect.

‘*Beginning with the Ear, in due order*’;—the phrase ‘*in* *due order*’
has been added w ith a view to prevent the notion that the term ‘*ādi*’
signifies *kind*. “*Order*” again is in accordance with position; hence
what is meant is the order in which the organs have been mentioned in
the foregoing verse.

‘*Organs of action*’;—it is the ‘action’ of *motion* that is meant
here.—(91)
