The term ‘*svādhyāya*’ here stands for the *act of studying* (in
general; and not for *Vedic study*, which is what it ordinarily means);
and the subject-matter of the study is therefore indicated by the term
‘*of theThree Vedas*,’ ‘*traividyena*.’ Even though the two terms
(‘*svādhyāyena*’ and ‘*traividyena*’) do not stand in close proximity,
yet they are construed together on account of their denotations being
correlated, in accordance with the law that ‘when the denotation of one
term is connected with that of another, they should be taken as
correlated.’ Hence, even though both the terms are in the same
(Instrumental) case, yet one (*traividyena*) may be taken as denoting
the object of the other (*svādhyāyena*) by altering the signification of
the case-ending; the phrase ‘*traividyena svādhyāyena*’ thus being
construed as ‘*trayāṇām Vedānām (traividyasya) adhyayanena
(svādhyāyena*),’ ‘*by a thorough study of the three Vedas*’

‘*Traividya*’ is the compounded form of ‘*trayo*’; the formation of the
term being similar to that of such terms as ‘*chaturvarṇya*’ and the
rest.

Or, ‘*svādhyāyena'* may be taken (as usual) in the sense of the *study
of the verbal text of the Vedas*, and ‘*traividyena'* in that of the
study of their meaning.

‘*By Observances*’—by the ‘*Sāvitra*’ and other observances kept by the
Religious Student.

‘*By Libations*’—*i.e*., those that are poured at the time of the
Initiation,—or the kindling of fire with fuels, which the Religious
Student has to do every morning and evening, may be spoken as
‘*libation*,’ on account of Fire being the receptacle of the act of
kindling (just as it is of the act of pouring libations).

“Is not the putting of fuel on the fire really a ‘libation’—that you
should call it so simply from the said analogy?”

People say that it is not really a ‘libation because ‘libations’ and
‘offerings’ consist only of eatable substances.

“How then does the author himself say (under 2.186) that ‘the Religious
Student should, every morning and evening *offer the libation (juhuyāt*)
of fuels into the Fire’?”

It is only in a figurative sense that the ‘laying of fuel’ is called
‘*homa*’, ‘libation’; the idea being that the fuel for the kindling of
fire is thrown into it in the same manner as substances are poured as
libations; and it is on the basis of this analogy that the *kindling* is
called ‘*libation*’ In the original injunction (of fire-kindling) the
words used are ‘*sami* *dham-ādadhyat*,’ ‘should lay the fuel’ \[where
the word ‘*homa*,’ ‘libation’ is not used\]. As for the words (in Manu,
2.186) ‘*agnim juhuyāt tābhih*,’ (‘should offer the libation of fuels
into fire’), we shall point out later on that they are purely
explanatory (not mandatory), and mean something quite different; and in
explanations, figurative expressions are not out of place.

\[This is the view of some people\]. The right view however is that the
offering of any fit and proper substance constitutes the acts of
‘*Yāga*’ (Sacrifice) and ‘*Homa*’ (Libation). It is only in this sense
that we can rightly comprehend several injunctions. For instance, we
have the injunction ‘*praitaram praharati*,’ where ‘*praharati*,’ is
taken to mean ‘offer in sacrifice’ and ‘*prastaram*’ (‘bed of
Kuśa-grass’) is taken as the substance offered \[and certainly the
‘Kuśa-bed’ is not an *eatable* substance\],

“In this particular instance, we have to take the ‘sacrifice’ as
consisting of the offering of the Grass-bed, simply because it is so
directly enjoined. And further, *Kuśa-grass* also is eatable for some.”

Well, how is it then in the case of the ‘*Śākala-homa*’ (where *pebbles*
are offered)?”

“In that case also it has to be done in that way, because of the direct
injunction—‘one should offer the pebbles’.”

What explanation can there be of the case of the ‘*Grahayāga*,’ where
fuels of the *arka* and other plants are offered to each of the Grahas?

From all this it is clear that wherever we have the term ‘*juhuyāt*’
(‘should offer libation’) and the connection of a Deity also is
mentioned, in the original Injunction, the act is to be regarded as
‘*Homa*,’ ‘Libation.’

‘*By offerings*’—*i.e*., by offerings to the Gods and *Ṛṣis*.

Up to this point we had the duties of the Religious Student.

Next follow the duties of the Householder.

‘*By children*,’—*i.e*., by the act of begetting children.

‘*By the great sacrifices*’—*i.e*., by the five ‘sacrifices,’ consisting
of *Brahtnayajña* and the rest.

‘*By sacrifices*,’—*i.e*., by the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other Vedic
Sacrifices.

The question being raised that—“if there were any useful purpose served
by these acts, then alone could there be any use for the sacraments
which fit a man for these acts,”—the Author says—‘*this body is made
godly,’ ‘tanuḥ*.’—‘*Brahma*’ here stands for the Supreme God, the
Creator; and this ‘*tanu*,’ body, is made ‘related to God,’
‘*godly*,’—by all these acts, which are laid down in the Veda and in the
*Smṛtis*. ‘*Godliness*’ meant here is that which consists in *being
transformed into the very essence of God*; as this is the highest end of
man; as for other forms of ‘relation to God,’ this is already an
accomplished fact for all beings,—for the simple reason that God is the
Creator of all things; and hence these other relations cannot be
anything to be longed for. For this reason it is the attainment of
‘Final Release’ that must be meant here.

The term ‘*brāhmī*,’ ‘godly’—as also the term ‘*tanu*,’ ‘body’—refers to
the personality ensouling the body; as it is the personality that is
consecrated by the sacraments; and it is the personality that attains
Final Release; as for the physical body, it entirely perishes.

Others have explained the phrase ‘*it made godly*’ to mean that ‘it is
made capable of reaching Brahma as (they argue) the actual ‘*becoming
Brahman*’ is not possible by means of acts alone; Final Release (which
is what is meant by⁽becoming Brahman’) is'attainable only by means of
*Knowledge* and *Action* conjointly. Hence what the text means is that
the man, by the said acts, becomes entitled to meditate upon *Ātman*
(Brahman). To this end we have the Vedic text—‘O Gārgi, when anyone,
without knowing the Imperishable One, sacrifices, pours oblations,
performs penances, studies the Veda or gives charities, all this becomes
perishable’ (*Bṛha* *dāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*, 3. 8. 10).

It is just in view of these considerations that the text has been
explained as a mere ‘*arthavāda*,’ meant to eulogise the injunction of
the Sacraments.

Some people have taken the expression ‘godly’ figuratively—on some basis
or other—to mean ‘capable of reciting the Veda and of performing the
acts prescribed in the Veda’; ‘*brahma*’ being taken as equivalent to
‘Veda.’

> “How is it then that Gautama (8. 8) has spoken of ‘forty sacraments’?
> There the *Soma-sacrifice* also has been mentioned as a *sacrament*;

As a matter of fact, the statement of Gautama is purely commendatory,
the Soma-sacrifice being spoken as a ‘sacrament’ in the sense that it
brings about in the performer’s soul a peculiar aptitude.

Similarly in the present context real Sacraments have been mentioned
along with non-sacraments with a view to indicate that both equally lead
to the same result; and the purpose served by this is to show that the
performance of all of them is necessary. It is thus not necesary to take
the verse as apart from the section dealing with Sacraments.

Then again, the term ‘*is made*’ is meant to be commendatory, as is
shown by the fact that we have the present tense, and not the injunctive
affix. So that there is nothing to justify the idea that ‘the attaining
of Brahman’ is the reward (of what is enjoined). In fact the present
verse does not enjoin any actions; and hence there cannot arise any
desire on our part to know their result, which could justify the
assumption that the present tense has the force of the Injunctive; as
has been done in the case of the *Rātrīsatra*, in connection with which
even though we have the present tense in the term ‘*pratit ṣṭhanṭi*’
(‘obtain a standing’), yet it is taken as laying down the result
following from the Bātrisatra.

From all this it follows that all that is said in the verse is for the
eulogising of the Sacraments.

Some people interpret the verse by breaking it up into two parts—taking
it to mean that ‘the attaining of Brahman is the reward of the
compulsory acts, and of the optional acts the rewards are such as are
actually mentioned in the Veda along with these acts.’

But there is no authority for this; because the entire verse is purely
commendatory: specially as it has been already explained that the
compulsory acts are performed without the idea of any rewards. It is in
view of this that our Author has said (under 2.2) that ‘it is not right
to be absorbed in desires.’—(28)
