‘*Gambling*;’—playing with dice. Cock-fighting, etc., are also
prohibited by this,—the term ‘gambling’ being used in its most general
sense.

‘*Quarelling with people*’;—wordy dispute, without any reason, on common
matters; or asking people at random for news.

‘*Calumniating*.’—Recounting the defects of other people through sheer
ill-will.

‘*Lying*’—describing things otherwise than what is actually seen or
heard.

Every one of these words has the Accusative ending, on account of its
being governed by the verb ‘should abstain from’ (in the preceding
verse).

‘*The gazing at and touching of women*’;—‘*gazing at*’ means looking
intently with a view to observe the shape of limbs; ‘this part of her
body is beautiful—that is not so,’and so forth.

‘*Touching*’ stands for *embracing*. These two are prohibited for fear
of their leading up to sexual intercourse; and this is to be applied to
the case of the young boy in some way or other.

‘*Injuring of others*,’—*i.e*., doing harm; obstructing the fulfilment
of some purpose. For instance, if he is questioned on matters relating
to the marriage of girls, he should not say that a certain bridegroom is
unfit, even if he be really so; he should remain quiet (say nothing), as
lying has been prohibited.—(179)
