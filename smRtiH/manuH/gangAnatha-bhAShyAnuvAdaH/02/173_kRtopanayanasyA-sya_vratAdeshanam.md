Verse 2.69 has laid down the order of sequence among Cleanliness, Right
Conduct and Vedic Study: and hence the Veda should be read in that same
order. The learning of the Veda having become possible after the
Initiatory Rite, the present verse serves to lay down the order in which
it is to be done. The boy, on being initiated, should keep the
‘*Traividya*’ and other observances; and then proceed to study the Veda.

‘*For the boy whose Initiatory rite has been performed*,’—*i.e*.,—for
tho Religious Student—‘*instruction reagarding obser* *vances is
considered desirable*,’—and is actually done by teachers. As a matter of
fact, it is on the strength of the scriptures that the said instruction
is ‘considered desirable’; hence the ‘desirability’ spoken of stands for
the ‘necessity of doing’ it.

After this instruction follows the ‘*getting up of the veda*,’—‘*in due
order*’—as here described ,—‘*according to the prescribed rule*.’—This
is a reiteration, for the purpose of filling up the metre.—(173)
