‘*Superiors*’;—those possessed of greater amount of wealth and learning.
Towards these ‘*he should behave always as towards the
Teacher*’;—*i.e*., he should offer him obeisance, welcome and so forth.

In this verse many such words have been used as are superfluous; but in
as much as this is a metrical work, such usage is not objectionable.
‘Towards superiors’ was all that should h ave been said here; ‘as
towards the Teacher’ would be already implied; ‘*behaviour*’ has already
been mentioned in the preceding verse. Many such instances can be found
in this work.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s son who has acquired the position of the
Teacher*’;—the addition of the word ‘*ācārya*’ is meant to show that the
son should have obtained the position of the Teacher. The sense is that,
if during the Teacher’s absence, his son teaches his pupils for a few
days, he should be treated as a Teacher

Another reading is ‘*guruputresvaṭhāryeṣu*.’ The term ‘*ārya*’ in’this
case would mean ‘one belonging to the highly qualified Brāhmaṇa-caste,’
as we find in such instances as—‘śūdrāccāryo jyāyān.’

This verse does not enjoin that such treatment should lie accorded to
all the sons of the Teacher.

‘*Towards the Teacher’s own blood-relations*.’—The epithet ‘own’ has
been added for the purpose of restricting the statement to members of
the Teacher’s family; the mere fact of being a member of the Teacher’s
family is the sole ground for the treatment being accorded to
him,—irrespectively of age, learning, etc.—(207)
