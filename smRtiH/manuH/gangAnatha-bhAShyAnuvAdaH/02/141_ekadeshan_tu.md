‘*A part of the Veda*.’—The Mantra only or the Brāhmaṇa portion
only;—Or, without the Veda itself, only the Vedic subsidiary
sciences;—he who teaches this,—and also even the whole Veda, (but)—‘*for
a living*,’—*i.e*., not prompted purely by the injunction of ‘becoming a
preceptor,’—he is an *Upādhyāya*, a ‘Sub-teacher,’ not an Ācārya,
‘Preceptor.’

He who may teach even the entire Veda to a pupil initiated by another
person, is not a ‘Preceptor’; nor is he a ‘Preceptor’ who, having
initiated a pupil, does not teach him the entire Veda.

“If the *teaching of a portion of the Veda* is made the distinguishing
feature of the ‘Sub-Teacher,’ and the *Initiating* is the characteristic
of the ‘Preceptor,’—then what would be the character of that person who
does *not* do the initiating, but teaches the *whole* Veda? He would be
neither a ‘Preceptor’ (since he has not done the initiating), nor a
‘Sub-teacher’ (as he has not taught only a *portion* of the Veda). Nor
has any other name been heard of for such a teacher.”

Our answer is as follows:—According to what is going to be said in 149
such a person would be the ‘Teacher,’ ‘*Guru*,’ Who is inferior to the
‘Preceptor,’ but superior to the ‘Subteacher.’

The terms ‘*api*’ ‘*punaḥ*’ in the Text only serve to fill in the
metre.—(141)
