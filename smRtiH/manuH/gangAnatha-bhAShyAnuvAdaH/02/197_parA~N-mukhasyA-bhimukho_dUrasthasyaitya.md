‘*When the teacher has his face averted*,’—the pupil should sit facing
him; that is, if the Teacher happen to have his face turned the other
way when he gives his directions, the pupil should go over to the side
facing the teacher and then do the aforesaid (listening and conversing).

‘*When the teacher is at a distance*,’—the pupil should go near him,
approach him.

When the teacher is seated, as also when he is lying down, the pupil
should *bow down*— humbly bend his body low.

‘*Nideśe*’ means ‘close by’; when he is sitting close by, then the
aforesaid acts should be done after bowing low.—(197)
