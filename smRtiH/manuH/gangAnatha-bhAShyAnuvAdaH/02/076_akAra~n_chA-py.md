This verse is a valedictory supplement to the foregoing injunction.

The syllable ‘*oṁ*’ is an aggregate of the three letters ‘*a*,’ ‘*u*’
and ‘*m*’; and the present verse describes the origin of each of these.

‘*Out of the three Vedas*’—from the three Vedas.

‘*Milked*’—churned out; just as butter is churned out of the curd.

Not only the three letters, but also something else, in the shape of the
syllables ‘*bhūḥ-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ*.’—(76)
