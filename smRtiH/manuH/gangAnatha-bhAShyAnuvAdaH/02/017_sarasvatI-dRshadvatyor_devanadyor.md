The sources of the knowledge of Dharma have been described; it has also
been stated that in cases of couflict there is *option*; persons
entitled to the performance of *dharma* have also been indicated in a
general way. Now the author proceeds to describe those countries that
are fit for the performance of Dharma, and where (on that account) it
becomes incumbent to perform it.

‘*Sarasvatī*’ is the river bearing that name. ‘*Dṛṣadvatī*’ is another
river; that which *lies between these two*, that region they call by the
name of ‘*Brahmāvarta*’; that is the region which the cultured speak of
by that name.

‘*Created by the Gods*’—is for the purpose of eulogising the boundaries
and the bounded region; the sense being that ‘the region is created by
the Gods, and is therefore more sacred than all other regions.’—(17)
