‘*All the aforesaid*’—*i.e., those not devoid of the Veda and
sacrifices* and so forth—‘*being* *unavailable*’;—‘*wander over the
whole village*’;—he may go over the whole village, irrespectively of
caste and other distinctions, for the purpose of obtaining his means of
subsistence. Only ‘*he should avoid persons of ill-repute*’—*i.e*.,
those who are known to have committed serious sins, even though they may
never have been seen to commit them; Says Gautama (2-35)—‘The begging of
alms may be done from all castes, save the disreputable and the fallen.’

‘*Having his speech well-controlled*’;—*i.e*., till he obtains the alms,
he should not utter any words save those used in the actual
begging.—(186)
