The statement that ‘corporeal consecration is purifying and auspicious’
has pointed out the use of the Sacraments Now, ‘purification’ consists
in removing the impurities of the impure thing; and the question
arises—“whence the impurity of the Body?”

It is in answer to this that the text speaks of ‘*the taint of seed and
womb*,’;—‘*of the seed*,’ is that which arises from, or is due to, the
seed;—similarly ‘of the womb’ (is that which arises from, or is due to,
the womb). ‘*Taint*’ is evil, an unseen source of pain. All that is
meant by this is that the Body is impure, owing its birth to the seed
and the womb. The ‘seed’ of man consists of semen and ovule; and these
by their very nature, are impure. Similarly the womb, is impure by
contamination. And the ‘*taint*’ of the man thus caused is ‘*removed?*
wiped away, by the sacraments.

These sacrameuts are now mentioned ; *some* are actually named, while
others are left to be indicated by the peculiar circumstances of what is
sanctified.

‘*Libations in connection with pregnancy*,’—thoso that are offered when
the pregnancy of the woman has come about,—or those that are offered for
the purpose of bringing about pregnancy; in either case the libations
are said to be ‘*in connection with pregnancy*.’ What prompts the
offering is the *pregnancy*, the woman being only a means to it; so that
the libations, being prompted by pregnancy, are said to be in connection
with it; and these are the rites of ‘*Pumsavana*,’ ‘*Sīmantonnayana*’
and ‘*Garbhādhāna*.’ The word ‘*libation*’ here stands for the whole
rite; as the ‘*Garbhādhāna*’ (‘Conception’) is certainly not a
‘Libation.’ The exact details of the rites, regarding the substances to
be offered, the duties and so forth—arc to be found out from the
*Gṛhyasūtras*.

Just as by the ‘libations in connection with pregnancy’. so also by the
sacrament known as ‘*Jātakarman*’ (Rites attendant upon birth).
Similarly by ‘*Tonsure*’;—‘*Chauḍa*,’ ‘*Tonsure*,’ is meant that which
is performed for the purpose of the ‘*cūḍā*’ (the- lock of hair left to
grow on the crown of the head). ‘*Tying of the gross-girdle*’ is
*Upanayana*; as it is at this ceremony that the girdle of muñja-grass is
tied, this indicates that rite. ‘*Nibandhana*’ is the same as
‘*bandhana*’; and the prefix ‘*ni*’ has been added for filling up the
metre.

‘*Jātakarman*’ and the rest—which are the names of the sacraments—have
been made into a copulative compound, and then have the instrumental
ending added to show that they are instrumental in the removal of taint.

Every ‘consecration’ brings about some peculiarity, either seen
(material) or unseen (spiritual), in the thing consecrated, which is
subservient to something else to be brought about, and has either
already subserved, or is going to subserve, the purposes of this latter
thing. For instance, in the case of the ‘threshing of the corn’ and
‘offering sacrifices with the corn,’ the ‘threshing’ (which is the
‘consecration’ or ‘purification’ in this case) produces in the corns,
that are going to help in the accomplishment of the sacrifice, the
visible peculiarity, in the shape of the removal of the chaff. \[So that
in this case the thing consecrated is going to subserve some useful
purpose\]. When again it is said that ‘removing the garland from the
head one should keep it in a clean place,’ the garland is something that
has been used (and served its purpose) and has become mangled in shape;
so that the special method of its *disposal* (after use) only produces
an invisible effect. Now all the sacraments mentioned in the text are
prescribed for the purpose of the purification of the body; but they are
not found to bring about in the body any such effects as the removal of
bad odour, etc., which is done by washing with clay and water. Hence the
‘purification’ in this case should be understood to consist in some
unseen effect; just as has been held to result from the particular time
at which the birth of the individual takes place. And when the man has
become purified by such purification, he becomes fit for the performance
of acts prescribed in the *Smṛtis* and in the Vedas; just as the Butter
sanctified by *mantras* is fit for use in libations. In connection with
ordinary (non-religious) acts, all necessary purity is attained by the
(external) purification of things; as in the case of the Butter required
for eating. As for that ‘purity’ of the boy which consists in his
*touchabien?ss*, this is brought about by the ‘washing with water’
mentioned as the means of purifying the body (in 5.109). Hence has it
been declared that ‘there is no impurity arising from his touch.’

Our answer to the above is as follows:—What we mean by the consecration
subserving the purposes of sacrifices is-not that it is a subsidiary
integral part of these,—which character is indicated by Direct Vedic
Declaration and certain other means; all that we mean is that it is
helpful to it; and this helpfulness is possible even without the one
forming an integral part of the other. For instance, we have the
injunction regarding the ‘laying of fire’ and that relating to ‘Vedic
study’; but there is no Direct Injunction or any other indication (of
these forming part of any sacrifice); all that we find is the Vedic text
‘offerings are made into the which lays down the ‘*Āhavanīya*’ (as the
receptacle of the offerings); and as the precise nature of the
‘*Āhavanīya*’ is superphysical, the only way in which it can be brought
into existence is by means of the prescribed ‘laying of fire,’ which is
contained in the text ‘the Brāhmaṇa should lay the fires during spring’;
so that the ‘laying of fire’ helps in the sacrificial performance
through the bringing into existence of the *Āhavanīya*, and yet it does
not form an integral part of the performance. ‘Vedic study’ also helps
in the sacrificial performance, through the knowledge of the meaning of
Vedic texts (acquired by the study).

Analogous to these two is the case of the sacraments:

1.  the act of Vedic study can be done only by one who has had these
    sacraments performed,
2.  it is only when one has carried out the injunction of Vedic study
    that he can marry,
3.  it is only when one has married that he can ‘lay the fire,’
4.  and it is only one who has ‘laid the fire’ that is entitled (to the
    performance of sacrifices).

It is in this way that even though the sacraments are laid down apart
from the sacrificial injunctions, yet their due performance is helpful
towards the sacrificial acts.

Since the text speaks of ‘*Niṣeka*’ (conception, depositing of the
semen) as the first of the sacraments, it follows that all the
sacraments for the child are to be performed by the father. Thus the
*mantra* for the ‘Rites on Birth’ reads—‘You are my very soul, bearing
the name of son’ (*Śatapatha* *Brāhmaṇa*, 14. 9. 4. 8.) \[which clearly
shows that it is recited by the father\]. It is for the father again
that the begetting and instructing of children has been prescribed as a
duty in the verse—‘Having paid off the three debts etc.,’ (6.35); and
the passage. It is for this reason that the duly instructed son is
called the real son,’ speaks of ‘instruction,’ which consists in
teaching the boy his duties; and we shall show later on that this
‘instruction’ is accomplished only by teaching hi m the Veda up to the
point where the boy comprehends its full meaning. It is thus that the
sacraments are of use to both: they help the father in the begetting of
the right sort of child, and they help the boy in the performance of
those acts that can be done only by one who has been duly consecrated.
Thus it is the father on whom devolves the task of having the sacraments
properly performed; and on his death, for hi m who takes his place; for
instance, it is said ‘he who h as not been consecrated should be
consecrated by his brothers who have had their consecration already
done.’ (*Yājñavalkya*, 2.124).—(27)

The author next indicates, by way of illustration, those acts in which
the sacraments of the Boy are helpful:—
