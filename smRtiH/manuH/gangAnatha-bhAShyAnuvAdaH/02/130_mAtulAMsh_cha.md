The plural number in the word ‘superiors’ indicates that this word does
not stand for those superior persons that are mentioned in the present
verse; it is meant to be a generic name, standing for persons superior
in the point of wealth, etc., as mentioned by Gautama (in 6.20).

These when they are ‘younger’—whose age is lower than that of the
nephew, etc.

‘*Here l am*’—indicates the name of the accoster; the term ‘I’ being
meant to come after the name.

When the said persons have arrived, one should rise to meet them and
accost them in the manner here prescribed. The present direction
prohibits the use of the vocative term ‘*bhoḥ*,’ ‘sir,’ in the greeting.
Gautama also has said—‘There should be rising to meet; these are not to
be saluted.’ (6.9).—(130)
