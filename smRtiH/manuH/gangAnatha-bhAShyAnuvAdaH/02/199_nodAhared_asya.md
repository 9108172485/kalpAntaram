‘*He should not pronounce*’—should not utter—‘*the teacher’s name*.’

‘*Mere*’—*i.e*., bereft of such honorific titles as ‘*Upādhyāya*,’
‘*Ācārya*,’ ‘*Bhaṭṭa*’ and the like;—‘*even behind his back*.’

‘*Nor should he mimic*’—should not imitate him, like an
actor;—‘*gait'*—(saying) ‘thus does my teacher walk’;—‘*speech*’—*i,e*.,
swiftly, slowly, at a medium pace and so forth;—‘*deportment*’—‘thus he
eats,’ ‘thus he hinds his turban,’ ‘thus he roams about,’ and so forth.

What is prohibited here is imitating the teacher in a joking
spirit.—(199)
