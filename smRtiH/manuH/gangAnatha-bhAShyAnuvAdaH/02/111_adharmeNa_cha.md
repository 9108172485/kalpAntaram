The present text describes the evil effects of transgressing the above
prohibition.

He who instructs a pupil—‘you should read this’—in an unlawful manner,
either when he is not asked, or when he is asked in an unlawful manner;
and be also who asks in an unlawful manner;—both of these die, before
time. If only one of them happens to be the transgressor, then he alone
dies. When asked in an unlawful manner, if the wise man docs not
explain, then the questioner dies; but if he does explain, then both of
them die. This indication of the evil effects proceeding from improper
questioning clearly implies that for the questioner also there is a
proper manner of putting questions.

‘*Or incurs the ill-will*’—enmity—of the people.—(111)
