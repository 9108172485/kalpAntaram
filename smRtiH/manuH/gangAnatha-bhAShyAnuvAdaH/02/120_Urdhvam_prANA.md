This verse is commendatory to what has gone before.

‘*On the elder*’—the person of higher *age*—‘*approaching*’—coming
up,—‘*the vital breaths*’—the sources of life, the inner airs—‘*of the
younger*’—‘*rush outward*’—move out; *i.e*., giving up their functions,
they intend to cut off his life.

When however he rises to meek him and salutes him, the breaths proceed,
as before, to sustain his life.

‘*Recovers*’—becomes resuscitated.—(120)
