‘*Where*’—in whatever place, in the assembly of wicked people,—his
teacher’s *censuring*—setting forth of wrongs really committed by
him,—or *defaming*—attributing to him of evils not present in him—‘*is
going on*,’—‘*there*’ ‘*he should close his ears*’—cover them up with
his finger, etc.

‘*Thence*’—from that place,—‘*he should go away to another
place*.’—(200)
