There might be some one who, being an unbeliever, might form the
misconception that the acts laid down in the Veda are fruitless, and
omit to do them; hence with a view to induce such a man to undertake the
performance of those acts, the Author, placing himself in the position
of a friend, proceeds to indicate the. perceptible results that follow
from the acts in question, to say nothing of other kinds of results.

The man who performs the act, known as ‘duty,’ ‘Dharma,’—which is ‘*laid
down by the Revealed Word and the Recollections*—obtains ‘*here*,’ in
this wold, as long as he lives, ‘*fame*,’ praise, honour, regard; that
is, all men respect him and love him as one ‘who is firm in the rightful
path and highly virtuous.’

‘*After death*,’—in another body—he obtains that ‘happiness’ superior to
which there is no other happiness. As a matter of fact, almost all the
acts are prescribed in the Veda as to be done by one who desires Heaven;
and ‘Heaven’ stands for ‘unsurpassed happiness’; hence it is that the
author speaks of ‘unsurpassed happiness.’

For these reasons, it is only right that the unbeliever also, who seeks
for nothing but visible results, should undertake the performance of the
acts in question. This is the purport of the text.—(9)
