These ‘*deserve to be honoured like the Teacher’s wife*’—by rising to
meet them, saluting them, offering them seat and so forth.

The equality of these to the Teacher’s wife haviug been already
mentioned by the phrase ‘like the Teacher’s wife,’ the addition of the
words ‘*they are equal, etc*,’ is meant to indicate that one should do
for these persons other things also;—such as carrying out their wishes
and so forth—that one does for the Teacher’s wifìe. If this were not so
indicated, the implication of the context would be that it is only in
the matter of salutation that they have to be treated ‘like the
Teacher’s wife.’

The text speaks of only ladies of older age; but in the case of younger
ladies also the same rule of salutation has to be observed.—(131)
