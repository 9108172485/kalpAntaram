He becomes omnipresent, all-pervading, like *Ākāśa*.

‘*Transfigured into Ākāśa*’—means that he acquires the nature of Ākāśa.
‘*Mūrti*,’ ‘Figure,’ does not stand here for the *Body*; as Ākāśa has no
‘body’ at all.

“What is this ‘*Brahman*’ into whose form the man is said to become
merged?”

It is the Supreme Soul, of the nature of Bliss; He of whom all these
embodied souls are mere inodes, just as waves are of the ocean perturbed
by the force of wind. And just as when the ocean becomes calm, the waves
become merged into it, in the same manner the embodied souls become
transformed and merged into the Supreme Soul. All this is going to be
described in detail in Discourse 12.

What is enjoined in the present context is the mere reciting and study
of the *Gāyatrī* verse, not its *Japa*, repetition; this is shown by the
fact that the number of repetitions is not stated.

‘*Untired*’;—this denotes that the recitation is to be carried out again
and again; as a single recitation can never tire a person.

What is enjoined here pertains to persons seeking for Final
Release.—(82)
