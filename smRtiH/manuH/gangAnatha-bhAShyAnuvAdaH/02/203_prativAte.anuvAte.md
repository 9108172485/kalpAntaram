When the wind comes from the side on which the Teacher is sitting to
where the pupil sits,—and when it comes from where the pupil sits to
when the Teacher is,—these are called ‘*lee-ward*’ and ‘*wind-ward*’;
one being ‘lee-ward’ and the other ‘wind-ward.’ In either of these
fashions one should not sit in the Teacher’s company; be should sit in
such a fashion that he gets the wind sideways.

‘*Beyond his hearing*’;—*i.e*., wbat he cannot hear.

‘*Nothing*,’—with reference either to the Teacher or to other persons.

‘*He should say*’—nothing, what the Teacher cannot hear, but can see
from the moving of the lips that the pupil is saying something.—(203)
