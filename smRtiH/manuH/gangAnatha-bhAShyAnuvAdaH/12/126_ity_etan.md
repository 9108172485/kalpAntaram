‘*Iti*’—indicates the end of the Institutes.

‘*He who reads, shall he virtuous*.’ Some people explain ‘*ācāra*,’
‘*virtue*,’ as *virtuous conduct*, in accordance with the ordinances
that have been read.

And if he is so, ‘*he shall attain whatever state he way desire*.’—126

*This is the end of the Ordinances of Manu* as *declared by Bhṛgu*.

*Thus ends the Manubhāṣya of Medhātithi*.
