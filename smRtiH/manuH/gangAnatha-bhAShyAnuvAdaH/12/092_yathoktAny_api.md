‘*Even the said acts*.’—This does not sanction the abandoning of such
acts as the *Agnihotra* and the like; all that is meant to be enjoined
is that ‘one should concentrate his effort on the knowledge of
Self’—which prescribes the acquiring of the knowledge of Self.

‘*Having renounced the acts*.’—What the meaning of this phrase is that
one should concentrate his efforts upon the acquiring of the knowledge
of Self, even though this might involve the abandoning of such acts as
the worshipping at certain temples or attending upon elders and so
forth. This does not however sanction the voluntary renunciation of the
compulsory rites; but all other rites have to be renounced, without
which the knowledge of Self cannot be acquired.—(92)
