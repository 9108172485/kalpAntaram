What the verse describes is what happens in a large number of cases; the
sense being that in most cases whenever men are reborn in the species
mentioned, it is due to causes herein specified. Bat it is not always
so; as it is going to be asserted later on (55 *et. seq*.) that those
who commit the ‘heinous offences’ are born among the lower animals and
so forth.

‘*Birds*’ and ‘*beasts*’ stand here for all kinds of lower animals.

What the verse is really meant to indicate is that, among sins due to
Mind, Speech and Body, the succeeding ones are graver than the preceding
ones.—(9)
