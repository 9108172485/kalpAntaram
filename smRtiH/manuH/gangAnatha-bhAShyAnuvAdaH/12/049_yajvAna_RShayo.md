Words composed in a certain order are called ‘*Veda*.’

“In the course of the *states of existence*, what occasion is there for
the mention of *insentient* things? Words and other things are all
*insentient*.”

“It is too little when you say that words and other things are
inanimate. All the beings, from the gods down to the immoveable things,
exist in the form of *bodies*, and all bodies are insentient. As for the
sentient faculty, it appears in the form of personal consciousness,—and
this Personality, by itself, is devoid of qualities. But the body,
though insentient, comes to be regarded as sentient when it is inhabited
by the Personality.

Thus what the text means comes to this:—The Veda abounds in the quality
of ‘*Sattva*;’ hence by its study, people attain to the state partaking
of the quality of ‘Sattva.’ And ‘the attaining of the state partaking of
Sattva’ does not mean that the man abounding in ‘Sattva’ *become the
Veda*.

The view of other people is, that in all things there is a conscious
being supervising over them, and ‘personalities of the Veda’ are
described as residing in the regions of Varuṇa.—(49)
