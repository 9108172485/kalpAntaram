Though the text speaks of the number of members as the more important
factor, yet it should be understood as laying greater stress upon the
qualifications.

‘*A person learned in the three Vedas*’—he who has learnt the three
Vedas, and knows their meaning.

‘*Logician*’—who is an expert in drawing Inferences; endowed with the
faculty of considering the *pros* and *cons* of a subject.

“It has been said under that a Logician can never be *learned in the
Veda*.”

True; but, even though he may not himself learn the Veda, yet he may
know its contents from other men; and the knowledge of Logic will enable
him to put forth special efforts in this line.

This same remark applies to the person knowing the *Nirukta* also.

‘*Lawyer*’—one who has studied the Ordinances of Manu and other
law-books.

‘*Three men belonging to the life-stages*’;—those who are devoted to the
actual performance of their duties become specially adept in matters
relating to *Dharma*.

‘*First*.’—Some people explain this to mean, (1) the Religions Student,
(2) the Householder and (3) the Wandering

Mendicant; since it is only these persons whose entry into villages has
not been forbidden; and it is in this order that the life-stages have
been named by Gautama (3. 2)—‘The Student, the Householder, the
Wandering Mendicant, and the Recluse.’ Others however argue that
‘causing injury’ being not permitted for the Mendicant, how could he
decide points of law (which may involve loss and injury to certain
persons)? Hence the *Recluse* should be the third.—(111)
