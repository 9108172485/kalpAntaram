When it was said ([under
62](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc202246.html))
that ‘for stealing water one becomes a *Plava* -bird,’ it was water for
drinking purposes that was meant; while in the present verse, it is
water for irrigating fields and such other purposes.

[Under verse
62](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc202246.html),
the term ‘*Rasa*’ may be taken either as the *first* kind of flavour
(*Sweet*), or as medicinal substances.—(67)
