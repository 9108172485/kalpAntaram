**(verses 12.42-44)**

‘*Cāraṇas*’—dancers, singers, pimps, and so forth.

‘*Suparṇas*’—a particular kind of birds.

The epithet ‘*despised*’ is to be construed with ‘*Śūdras*,’—*i.e*.,
those *Śūdras* who disregard the Brāhmaṇas, poach upon their livelihood,
and are characterised by haughtiness, vanity, and such qualities. Such
injurious persons as thieves and others are also included among
the^(‘)*despised*.’—(42-44)
