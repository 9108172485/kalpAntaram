‘*Attains Brahman*’—becomes unified with Brahman.

Having cultivated sympathy for all beings, he experiences freedom from
all love and hate.

What this lays down is the propriety of concentrating oneself upon the
idea of the *unity of the Self*, not allowing it to be interrupted by
any notions of diversity. When the notion of diversity is present, one
cannot become ‘equal towards all.’

It is only when one has got rid of all notions of ‘I’ and
‘mine,’—expressed in such ideas as—‘This is myself,’ ‘this is mine,’ and
so forth,—that his notion of *unity* becomes fixed, and he attains
‘Brahman,’ which is of the nature of unsurpassed Highest Bliss. That is,
he is saved from all evil and attains that desirable result which has
been described in the scriptures.—125
