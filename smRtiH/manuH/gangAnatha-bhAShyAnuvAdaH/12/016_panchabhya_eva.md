Out of the five material substances another body is produced.

The meaning is that a material body is produced, without the process
involved in the mixture of semen and ovule. In fact, it is only in the
case of ‘*misbehaved men*’ that this body is made up of material
substances; in the case of righteous men it is made up of pure *light*
and consists of mere *Ākāśa*; as is declared in the passage—‘Consisting
of air, with a body of pure *Ākāśa*, etc.’

‘*Torment*’—great suffering.

‘*Strong*’—powerful enough to suffer super-physical torment.—(16)
