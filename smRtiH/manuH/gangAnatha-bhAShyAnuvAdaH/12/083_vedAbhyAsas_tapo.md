The term ‘*highest good*’ stands, not for the accomplishment of one’s
personal ends, but for the sure continuity of happiness.

‘Vedic Study’ and other things, already described before, have been
repeated here, for the purpose of eulogising the Knowledge of Self.

‘*Knowledge*’—of what is contained in the Veda.

The terms have been already explained.—(83)
