The ‘*Tāmisra*,’ the ‘*Aṇḍhatāmisra*’ and other hells have been
enumerated above (under 4.80).

‘*Being tossed about in this*’—lying on one side and turning on the
other and so forth.

Being bound up to the sword-like leaves of trees; or being ‘mangled’ by
these same leaves lying scattered on the ground—the limbs being cut
about like a piece of plantain-stalk.—(75).
