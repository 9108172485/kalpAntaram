‘*Ascetics*’—the Recluse and others devoted to austerities.

‘*Hermits*’—wandering mendicants, and the rest.

This shows that the said state belongs to people, not only by birth, but
by conduct also because there are no such species by birth as
‘*ascetics*’ and the rest; in fact the names are based upon what the men
do.

Others, however, think that there are a people known as ‘*Yatis*,’
‘Hermits,’ inhabiting the Meru mountain; as is clear from what we read
regarding ‘India having made over the Yatis to the Sālāvṛkas.’

‘*Vimānas*’—celestial cars, Puṣpaka, and the rest; those who move about
in these are ‘*Vaimānikas*,’ ‘*celestial beings*,’ denizens of heaven.

‘*First*’—lowest—(48)
