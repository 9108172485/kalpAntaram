‘*The characteristics of the quality*’ is the declaration of the subject
of treatment.

The term ‘*sāttvikam*’ is to be construed with difficulty as
follows:—‘*Guṇalakṣaṇam*’ is *that by which the quality is
characterised*; and the question arising ‘of what quality?’—the answer
is supplied by the term ‘*sāttvikam*,’ ‘*of sattva*.’—When need arises,
even the part of a compound becomes construed by itself, with another
word; and the meaning thus comes to be that—‘this is the characteristic
of the quality of ‘*Sattva*.’ This phrase should be understood to stand
on the same footing as the phrase ‘*devadattasya gurukulam*,’ where the
term ‘*guru*’ though forming the subordinate factor of the compound
‘*gurukulam*,’ is construed with the term ‘*devadattasya*.’

The meaning of the words has been already explained.—(31)
