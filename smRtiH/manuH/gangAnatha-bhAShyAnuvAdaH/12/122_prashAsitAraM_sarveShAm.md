‘*Ruler*’— Controller ‘*of* *all*’—from the Brāhmaṇa down to the Śūdra,
and so on. The determining of the heat and other characteristics of Fire
and other things,—the inner light in the Sun, the movement in the sky of
the Sun and the Stars, etc.,—the laws regulating the operation of
actions and their retribution,—all this is due entirely to the
controlling power of the Being here referred to. This is what has been
thus described—‘O Gārgī, it is under the sway of this Imperishable One,
that, etc., etc.,” (*Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*, 3.8.9);—and again, ‘That
the Sun shines, and gives rain, the Moon gives light, Agni heats, Wind
blows, and Death, the fifth, pursues men,’ etc., etc.

‘*Minuter than the minutest atom*’— What is generally regarded as the
minutest thing conceivable,—*e.g*., the hundredth part of the
hair-tip,—this Being is devoid of even that small dimension; as is
described in the text—‘It is neither huge nor small’ (*Bṛhadāraṇyaka
Upaniṣad*, 3.8.8.) where all qualities are negatived. This Being is
cognisable only by means of an exceptionally keen intellect; but never
by any. one who is not very expert, or who is not well-versed in the
practice of meditation.—122
