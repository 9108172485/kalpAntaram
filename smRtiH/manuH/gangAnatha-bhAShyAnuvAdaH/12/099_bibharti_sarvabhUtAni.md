That the Veda upholds all beings has been indicated in the following
Brāhmaṇa-text—‘Sacrificial materials are offered into fire,—the fire
raises it up to the Sun,—the Sun bears it on his rays,—thence comes
rain; thus it is that the sacrificial material comes to be regarded as
the cause of the birth and existence of all beings.’ This same idea has
been expressed in the present work also—‘The material rightly thrown
into the fire rises up to the Sun,’ and so forth (3.76).

For these reasons I regard this as the best means for the accomplishing
of the ends of man. In what manner the Veda supplies all the knowledge
regarding man’s duties has been already shown.

“What fulfils all these ends,—is it *Vedic* (spiritual), or *worldlly*
(physical)?”

The duty is spiritual, but the actual act, which is visible to the eye,
is physical.—(99)
