There are nine cavities in the body;—on these one should ‘withdraw’—draw
in —*the Ākāśa*, as ‘there is no external *Ākāśa*, nor any external
thing whatsoever.’

‘*Anila*’ is *wind*;—this also he shall withdraw.

‘*Movement*’—when, for instance, one moves about, or moves his hand and
feet, etc.

‘*Touch*’—of things external to the body.

Into these one shall withdraw the Wind.

‘*Digestion*’— brought about by the fire in the stomach,—and
‘*vision*’;—into this he shall withdraw *Light*;—‘*the best*’—that which
exists in the form of the Sun and other luminous substances.

‘*Fluids*’—in die form of fats and marrow;—into these he shall withdraw
Water.

Such is the withdrawal of the Great Elemental Substances. Next follows
the method of withdrawing the gods.—120
