The Moon—one shall withdraw into the mind. The ‘Moon’ here does not
stand for what we see moving in the sky, but the deity residing in man’s
mind.

‘*Space into the ear*’—The organ of hearing.

‘*Viṣṇu into movement*.’—Whenever one makes any the slightest movement,
it is due to the impelling force of Viṣṇu residing in the man’s body.

Similarly ‘*Hara into strength*’—When a man rises, and moves about and
does work, all this is the effect of strength which is due to the
presence of Hara.

Speech is *Agni*, and the excretions are Mitra;—all this one shall
contemplate upon as such.

Having thus withdrawn all into the body, one shall look upon it all as
subsisting in the Self.

When the true nature of the Self has been thus comprehended the man
realises that he himself is nothing apart from the Supreme Self.

All meditation shall be carried on in this manner.—121
