‘*Maitrākṣajyotika*,’ like the foregoing terms, is another name for a
*Piśāca*. Or the name may mean—“one who has *light* (‘*jyotiḥ*’) issuing
from the *hole* (‘*akṣi*’) of the *anus* (‘*maitra*’).”

Others explain the term as standing for the *owl*; ‘*maitra*’ being the
*light of the sun*, and ‘*akṣajyotiḥ*’ meaning *visual perception*; the
name connoting the fact that the owl cannot see in solar light—(72)
