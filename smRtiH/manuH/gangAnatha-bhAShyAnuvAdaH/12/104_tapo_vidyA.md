What is meant by this is that, even though one may possess
knowledge,—until his sins have been destroyed, he does not attain
Liberation;—nor if, though his sins may have been destroyed, he has not
acquired knowledge of the Self.

his very nature.

‘*Immortality*’—not returning to metempsychic birth; which has also been
described as consisting in pure Bliss.—(104)
