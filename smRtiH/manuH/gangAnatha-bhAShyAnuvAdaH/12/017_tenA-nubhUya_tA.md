‘*Yama*’ is the name of a particular deity, who inflicts punishments
upon sinners,—which are spoken of here as ‘*torments*.’

After the man has ‘*experienced*’ these torments, through the said body
of five constituent material substances,—those bodies become dissolved
into the said subtle particles of those substances.—(17)
