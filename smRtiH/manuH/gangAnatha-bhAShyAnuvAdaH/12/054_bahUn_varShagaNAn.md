‘*Dreadful hells*’—They are ‘dreadful’ by reason of the great sufferings
undergone; ‘hells’ being places of torment

‘*Expiation*’—Deeds are ‘expiated’ when their results have been
experienced; and when slight traces of them are left, the agent becomes
born in the several migratory states.

“How is it that the whole of the act is not entirely retributed in the
hells?”

It has already been explained that ‘hell’ is the result of very potent
deeds—not of mild ones. And since the cause is enfeebled by the
appearance of its effect, the Deed is rendered *mild*, less potent, by
the appearance of its results. Just as in the case of fire, when it has
been kindled, as soon as it has given forth sparks and heat, it becomes
milder; so also is the case with Hells.

“In the case of fire there are two states—mild and flaming; Hells
however are always of one uniform character.”

Like flaming fire, Actions also are prone to become strong and weak;
when they are strong, they lead to Hell, and when they are weak, their
retribution takes place elsewhere. Hence it is only light what has said
been regarding the ‘remnant’ of the deed (leading to
transmigration).—(54)
