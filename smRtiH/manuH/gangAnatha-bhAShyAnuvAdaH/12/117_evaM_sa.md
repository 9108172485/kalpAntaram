‘*The blessed Lord*’—Manu—propounded these Ordinances for the ‘*benefit
of mankind*.’ This is what Bhṛgu says to his pupils.

This sets at rest all doubts regarding persons entitled to seek for
knowledge.

‘*Secret*’— the true philosophy of the Self also, the revered Manu has
disclosed to me; and I also have disclosed it to you just as I heard it.
So that you should not seek for any further knowledge on the
subject.—(117)
