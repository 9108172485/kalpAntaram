‘*The twice-born*.’—This implies that the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya also
are entitled to the knowledge of Self; as has been made clear by Vedic
texts of the *Āraṇyakas*.

‘*Specially for the Brāhmaṇa*.’—This has to be taken as referring
particularly to the ‘Study of the Veda’; since to the ‘Knowledge of
Self’ are twice-born persons equally entitled.

Having attained this ‘knowledge of the Self’ the man ‘*has accomplished
his purpose*’;—that is, all his ends are fulfilled; there being no
higher end than Liberation.

“What has been said regarding the necessity of looking on all things as
the One Self appears to be contrary to perceptible facts. What we
perceive directly *is diversiy* (*diversity*?). How can this be
perceived as *one*? Any teaching regarding this would be setting forth a
purpose that cannot be fulfilled. What is diverse, how can that be
looked upon *as one*? The *ass* can never be looked upon as the *cow*.
It is only when the perceiving organ is deranged that one perceives a
thing as what it is not,—as we find when the shell is mistaken for
silver; and certainly no such wrong conception forms the subject of a
teaching. One who could propound such a teaching would be looked upon as
most foolish, and his words would bear no fruit at all”

It is in view of this that we have the next verse.—(93)
