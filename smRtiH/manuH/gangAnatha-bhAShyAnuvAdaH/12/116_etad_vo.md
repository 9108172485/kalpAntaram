The verse sums up what was promised to be done. What was promised under
l.2 and 1.4 as going to be done, has all been duly done. This indicates
the end of the Ordinances.

“As a matter of fact, we find teachings even after this; and that too in
the direct injunctive form. Why then is it said that the Ordinances are
summed up here?”

What comes after this is *pure knowledge*, which is a necessary
complement of all actions. So that there is no incongruity in what we
have stated. In fact, in all cases, the propounding of *Dharma* forms
the most important factor in all teachings, and *Knowledge* comes always
in the end. This was what we meant when we said that the present verse
sums up the Ordinances.—(116)
