This verse provides the definition of the ‘cultured’ man.

“The definition of the *cultured* man has already been [provided under
2.13](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc145586.html).”

But that verse has been suspected of having a totally different meaning;
hence it cannot be regarded as providing the required definition. There
is another statement—that man is *cultured* who is not affected by
desires.’ But in this, ‘learning’ is not made a necessary condition.
\[Hence this also cannot be accepted as the requisite definition.\]

When the Veda has been completely learnt and its meaning has been
thoroughly grasped,—‘*along with its supplements*’—as described by the
revered Vyāsa,—‘The Veda should be *supplemented* by *Itihāsas* and
*Purāṇas*’;—by this the *Smṛtis* also became included.

The mention of ‘*Brāhmaṇas*’ is purely reiterative; since none other
than the Brāhmaṇa is entitled to expound *Dharma*.

‘*Guided directly by the revealed texts*’—The revealed texts are their
‘*direct guide*’;—*i.e*., those for whom the Veda constitutes Perception
and all other means of knowledge. What is meant is that they look upon
the Veda as free from all defects, to the same extent that direct
Perception is regarded as entirely trustworthy,—they do not rely upon
those means of cognition that are based entirely on reasonings; they
regard the Veda itself as embodying ‘reasoning’ also, and do not seek to
establish the authority of the Veda by means of arguments.

Or, the phrase may mean that ‘they rely upon such Vedic texts as are
directly found’;—*i.e*., they look upon these directly perceptible texts
as the sole means of ascertaining what is *Dharma* (right) and what is
*Adharma* (wrong).—(109)
