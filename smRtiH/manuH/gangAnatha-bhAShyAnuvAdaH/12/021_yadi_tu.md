“It has been said under 10 that the body of misbehaved persons is made
out of *five constituents*; how is it that here the man is said to be
‘*deserted*’ by the substances?”

Our answer is that the man has no *material body*,—and yet there can be
no ‘torments’ for one devoid of a body; so that the bodies of men here
referred to are of an entirely distinct kind; and when the man is
described as ‘*deserted by the substances*,’ the *substances* meant are
those of peculiar character, such as are productive of exceptionally
soft and smooth and delicate bodies; and ‘*deserted*’ means that he has
expiated for his sins by the pain suffered; and what he is deserted by
are those bodies with which people become invested in Heaven.—(21)
