This is an exaggerated praise.

‘*Adjudicator of punishments*’—the officer who, in villages and cities,
fixes the punishments upon men; who is appointed to look after what
people do and what they do not know.

‘*Army*’—consisting of elephants, horses, chariots and
foot-soldiers;—the ‘*Commander*’ of all this.

‘*Kingly authority*’—royal authority over a small circle.

‘*Sovereignty over all men*’—the status of the Emperor.—(100)
