qualities,—is ‘*of three kinds each*’—according as it is ‘*high, low or
middling*’; thus they come to be of nine kinds;—there are endless
varieties of states, due to ‘*the peculiar character of the act and
knowledge of each man*’; acts are of various kinds, according as they
are good or bad, intentional or unintentional, and so forth. This is
what is meant by the phrase ‘*in accordance with the peculiar character
of acts and knowledge*’—(41)
