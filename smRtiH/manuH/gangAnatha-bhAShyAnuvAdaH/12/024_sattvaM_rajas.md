All that appertains to the Action-side of human activity has been
expounded; what appertains to the Knowledge-side of it. is now set
forth. And what is now stated, at the outset, deals with the subordinate
factors, and hence appears to savour of *Dualism*.

*Sattva* and the rest are the three qualities of the ‘Self.’ The term
‘Self’ here stands, not for the Soul, but for the Great Principle. In
fact, the term ‘*Self*’ denotes one’s *nature*, and not necessarily the
*inner side of things*. And then the *Soul* by its very nature, is
devoid of qualities.

Or what is mentioned here refers to the Soul that undergoes
experiences,—the qualities being the *object* of experience.

‘*Great One*’—This stands for Primordial matter itself,—this being what
happens to be in closest proximity to the Great Principle, which is the
first to evolve out of Primordial Matter. It is so called (the ‘Great
One’) because it is the source of all Emanations.—(24)
