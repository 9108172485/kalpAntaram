Forfeiture of the wages has been declared to be the penalty for the man
when not ill; the present verse lays down the law regarding one who is
ill.

If the labourer falls ill and gives up work after it has been
half-done,—hut, on recovering, comes hack and completes the task as
originally stipulated,—in this case, even though he may have taken a
long time to recover from illness and return to work, the man shall,
receive his wages, on having completed the work.—(210).
