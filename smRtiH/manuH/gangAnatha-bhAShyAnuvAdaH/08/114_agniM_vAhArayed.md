‘*He shall make him fetch water*’—with the hand, with only the leaf of
the fig tree intervening. As for the other details, regarding the man
going seven steps and so forth,—all this may be found in other *Smṛtis*
(*e.g*., Yājñavalkya, *Vyavahāra*, 103, and Nārada 2.296). The matter
being well known by tradition, our author has simply stated the
‘fetching of fire.’

‘*He*,’ *i.e*., the Judge—‘shall make him dive under water.’

‘*He shall make him touch the heads of his son and wife,
secerally*,’—the man shall touch the head with his hand; and as this
occurs in the context dealing with ‘oaths,’ the man should be made to
utter the swearing words also.

‘*Severally*’—separately, one by one.—(114)
