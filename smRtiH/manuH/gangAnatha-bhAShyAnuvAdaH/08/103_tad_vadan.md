Though deposing otherwise than the truth, the man does not fall off from
heaven; *i.e*., even though he has given false evidence, he does not
incur sin.

“Is this so at all times?”

The text proceeds to say that it is not so always; but only in cases
where it is done ‘*through piety*,’—*i.e*., through such pious motives
as pity and the like; ‘*cases*’ means *suits*. How piety forms the
motive is going to be shown in the next verse.

What is said here by the author is not out of his own mind; even
previous writers on Smṛti have reproduced this ‘divine assertion.’ “What
divine assertion?”—The assertion that ‘one should give false evidence
from considerations of piety’ has *emanated from the gods*; and having
heard that, Manu and other writers have reproduced it.

This is only a praising of false evidence under special circumstances.

Others however have explained this verse as supplementing the previous
injunction; and under this explanation what is said here should apply to
what has been said regarding the cattle—tenders and other Brāhmaṇas
being exhorted like *Śūdras*, when asked to give evidence. People might
ask how a Brāhmaṇa should be exhorted like a *Śūdra*; and the text
explains that there can be nothing wrong in this, since Manu and other
writers have made the declaration that they are to be treated as Śūdras,
and they are the sole authority in matters relating to right and wrong.

Witnesses should tell the truth; and that in the manner in which it is
enjoined; so that in a case where lying is righteous, that should he
regarded as right.—103
