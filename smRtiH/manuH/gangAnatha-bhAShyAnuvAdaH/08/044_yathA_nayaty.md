It has been said above that the king himself shall not, in a hurry
either haul anyone up or punish him for any offence; and the reason for
this lies in the consideration that it is quite possible that the act
that the king regards as an ‘offence’ might have been done in joke. Now
the question arises—how is it to be ascertained whether the act has been
done in joke or through malice and such other causes?

It is in answer to this question that it is said that ‘this is to be
ascertained by means of inference.’—Just as the
‘*hunter*’—fowler—‘*discovers*’—gets at—‘*the foot-print*’ of the deer
that has been wounded and disappeared from view by means of the drops of
blood flowing from the wound,—in the same manner the king should
discover the root-cause of the suit—which may be not perceptible,—by
means of inference.

The term ‘*dharma*,’ ‘*right*,’ here stands for *the real facts of the
case*.

The restriction of ‘inference’ as a means of finding out truth, already
mentioned before (in verse 3), is for the purpose of emphasising the
point.—(44)
