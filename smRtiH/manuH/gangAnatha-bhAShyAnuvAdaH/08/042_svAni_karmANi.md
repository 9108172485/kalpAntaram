This verse shows that the aforesaid ‘local’ and other laws serve both
visible (temporal) and invisible (spiritual) purposes.

‘*Their respective occupations*,’—in accordance with the condition of
their families;—the men who follow these^(‘)*come to be liked*.’ As a
rule it is only men living near each other that come to be liked; but
the man who follows his own occupation is liked also when he is at a
distance.

‘*While they remain firm in their own duties*’;—this stands for not
encroaching upon the work of other persons;—the meaning of the verse
being that—‘those who do not encroach upon the work of others come to be
liked by all men.’—(42).
