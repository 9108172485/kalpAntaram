‘*To them*’—*i.e*., to the depositors employed by the Judge;—if he
should not restore ‘*that gold*’—which was placed in deposit;—‘*in the
proper manner*,’—this is exactly what has been spoken of in the
preceding verse by the phrase ‘*in the form in which it was
entrusted*’;—then ‘*he*’—the Receiver—‘*shall be forced*’— by the
officers of the King—‘to *restore both*’—the deposit of the plaintiff,
as also that of the King.

‘*Such is the decree*’—declaration—‘*of the law*.’

What this means has already been explained.—(184)
