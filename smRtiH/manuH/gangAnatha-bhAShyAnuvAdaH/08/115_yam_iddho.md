‘*Blazing*’—flaming.

A red-hot iron-ball, when held by an innocent person, does not burn him;
the water does not make him float on the surface, if he has sworn truly;
he also does not suffer ‘*misfortune*,’—*i.e*. trouble, in regard to his
hair and other parts of his body. ‘Illness’ has already been mentioned
before.

Such a person is to ‘*be regarded as pure*’—*i.e*., innocent.

‘*Speedily*’—*i.e*., within a period of fourteen days,—as declared in
another *Smṛti*.—(115)
