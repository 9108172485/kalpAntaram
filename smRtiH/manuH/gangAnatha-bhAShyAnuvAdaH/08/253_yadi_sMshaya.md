“How can there be a doubt, when the marks are there?”

If some one were to come and secretly remove the hidden marks to another
place, this would give rise to uncertainty. And as for the open public
marks—in the shape of the *Nyagrodha* and other trees,—it is not that
these trees are to be found on boundaries only; as a matter of fact,
they grow in other places also. It is for these reasons that the said
marks are not always reliable, and hence doubts are likely to arise.

In a case where there is no possibility of such invalidating
circumstances, the marks themselves are sufficient proof.

‘*Dependent upon witnesses*’—*i.e*., due to witnesses. The settlement,
ascertainment, is such as has the witnesses alone for its basis. The
meaning of the verse is that in cases where the marks are doubtful, or
where there are no marks at all, the dispute regarding boundaries can be
settled only by oral testimony.—(253).
