+++
In the sacrificial performance, the man who does the most laborious
parts of the work and is employed to do what demands much effort,
receives a larger fee, and he who does the easier parts receives loss;
similarly among ordinary workmen also, those, *e.g*., employed in the
building of houses and temples,—when they do the work ‘jointly,’ as
among the architect, the mason and the carpenter.—their several shares
shall be alloted ‘*by* *the application* *of* *these
principles*’;—‘principle’ is *rule* laid down in the *Veda*, hence this
phrase means ‘according to the rule laid down in the Veda in connection
with sacrificial performances.’

Similarly in the producing of a drama, and such other business, the
shares are to ho alloted among the dancers, the singers and the players
of musical instruments.

Even though everyone of the persons concerned may be well versed in the
science and quite capable of doing all the work, yet the shares are to
be alloted in accordance with the work that is actually done by each,
and according to the character of the man concerned.

Thus ends the treatment of ‘Joint Concerns.’—(211)
