Having duly emphasised, by means of valedictory declarations, the duty
of restraining thieves, the text proceeds to lay down the law regarding
punishments.

‘*The unrighteous*’—stands, in this context, for the *thief*; him the
king shall ‘*suppress*’—keep in cheek—‘*by three modes of restraint*,’—
the term ‘*nyāy*? (*nyāya*?)’ being used in the literal sense of
‘restraint.’

‘*Imprisonment*,’—confinement in the royal fort, or in the prison-house.

‘*Enchaining*’— keeping in the prison-house, but in chains. ‘*Various
forms of immolation*,’—*i.e*., beginning from *beating* and ending with
actual *death* caused by the killing of the body.

That the methods of restraint are *three* would have been clear from the
enumeration itself; hence the addition of the epithet ‘*three*’ is to be
taken as serving the purpose of indicating that there are other methods
of restraint also; such as the pouring of heated oil and so forth.—(310)
