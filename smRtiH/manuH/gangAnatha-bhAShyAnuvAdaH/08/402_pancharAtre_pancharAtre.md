In as much as the source and destination and other circumstances
concerning commodities are variable, there are several rises and falls
in their prices. Hence the fixing of the price should be done publicly
after every five days; and it should not be regarded as done once for
all; nor should entire reliance be placed upon the traders alone; the
king himself should be always wide awake.

In connection with articles that take a long time to be disposed of, the
prices should be fixed every fortnight, while in other things it should
be done after every five Says.—(402)
