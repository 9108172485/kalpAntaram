+++
Even though one has lost her chastity, if the woman continues to be
protected by her father, brother or relatives,—and a Brāhmaṇa has
intercourse with her by force, he should be made to pay one thousand.

If however the woman is protected and still chaste, then the man is to
be banished and branded, in addition to the fine.

Even if the word ‘protected’ be taken to mean *chaste*, the Brāhmaṇa
would be absolved by paying a thousand ‘banishment’ and ‘branding’ being
the general punishment laid down for all cases of immoral intercourse
with other women.—(378)
