The aforesaid prohibition regarding conversing with women does not apply
to the case of ‘*wives of dancers and singers*’;—the term ‘*cāraṇa*’
standing for dancers, singers and other actors.

So also in the case of those ‘*who make a living of
themselves*,’—*i.e*., those wives who live upon their own beauty;—the
term ‘*jīviṣu*’ qualifying the masculine noun ‘*dārāḥ*’ (wives). Or
‘themselves’ may stand for ‘wives,’—the wife being half the self of the
man; and the term stands for *those who live upon their wives*;—*i.e.,
those who condone the presence of paramours for their wives*.

‘*Bring into contact*,’—unite their wives with other men.

‘*Secretly*,’—*i.e*., not in the open market-place. These women differ
from public prostitutes in this that they carry on their intrigues
within their own homes.

‘*Tempt them on*,’—eg g them on to actual sexual intercourse; enticing
the men by means of glances and jokes.

‘*Bringing into contact*’ implies *connivance*, while ‘*tempting*’
implies leading on to the actual act.

Or, the meaning may be that ‘they bring into contact, unite, their own
wives, and seduce, through their wives, the wives of other men’; *i.e.,
they* make their wives act as prostitutes as well as go-betweens.—(362)
