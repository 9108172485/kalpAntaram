When a commodity placed on the boat happen, in course of the crossing,
to be damaged ‘*by the fault of the boatmen*,’—*i.e*., by steering the
vessel through pools and eddies, or not anchoring when facing a storm,
or by not securely tightening up the boat with chains of iron or
leathern thongs,—then they should make it good,—‘*each according to his
share*,’—to the owner of the commodity.

‘*Collectively*’—*i.e*., all the boatmen that may be on the boat—(408)
