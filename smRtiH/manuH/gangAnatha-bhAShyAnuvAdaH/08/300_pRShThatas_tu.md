He who strikes with things other than those specified—*i.e*., with a
stick or such things—or on a part of the body other than those
mentioned,—*i.e*., on the eye, etc.—‘*incurs the guilt of a thief*.’

This is only meant to be deprecatory of the act referred to; and is not
the injunction of an actual punishment; so that in this case also the
penalty shall be the same as that in other oases of ‘hurt.’—(300)
