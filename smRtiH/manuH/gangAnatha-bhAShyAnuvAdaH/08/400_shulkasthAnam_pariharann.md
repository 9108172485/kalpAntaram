‘*Who buys and sells*’—*i.e*., the trader.

‘*Who avoids the custom-house*’—by taking to unfrequented roads.

‘*At the improper time*’—at night, when the custom-officers have gone
away.

‘*Who makes a wrong statement in counting*,’—when counting the articles,
if he mentions a figure larger than the actual one. ‘Counting’ is
mentioned only by way of illustration; hence the same rule applies to
case of *concealment* also.

Such a man should be made to pay a fine ‘*eight times the amount
evaded*’;—*i.e*., eight times the value of the articles that he
conceals; or eight times the duty that he tries to evade. The former is
more reasonable; as ‘evading’ would be more applicable to the
*articles*.

Others have offered the construction—‘*who buys and sells at the
improper time*’;—this would he a prohibition of carrying on transactions
before the duty has been paid, or in secret.—(400)
