In the case of open deposits ‘*the method of restoration*’ shall be as
just described in [verses 182 *et
seq*.](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201105.html)

The depositary shall not incur the censure of the debtor, as regards the
deposit to be restored.

This same rule should be applicable to the case where the article
deposited has been destroyed by rats, etc. For instance, the article
deposited having been wrapped up in a piece of cloth and placed in a
wooden vessel, if rats, with their sharp teeth, should cut through the
wood and devour the article,—it is no fault of the depositary’s. Then
again, if the article is deposited in the form of a bundle sealed in a
basket,—on account of its being such as cannot be contained in a wooden
box,—then also if it is eaten by rats, it is no fault of the
depositary’s. This is specially so, if it is known to the depositor, who
has been informed by the depositary that he possesses no wooden box
(where the article would be safe from rats, etc.),—or if the depositor
knows the man’s character and is close by (and hence is in a position to
know that the article has been really damaged by rats).—(188).
