‘*Once-born person*’—the *Śūdra*; if he ‘*insults*’—abuses—the higher
castes—‘*with gross abuse*’—harsh words attributing heinous
offences,—suffers ‘*the cutting off of the tongue*.’

‘*He is of low origin*’—being born out of the feet of Brahmā. This is
the reason given for the special penalty; and it serves also to indicate
the same punishment for persons of the reverse cross-breed also; since
these latter also are ‘of low origin’; specially in view of the
declaration that ‘there is no fifth caste.’—(270)
