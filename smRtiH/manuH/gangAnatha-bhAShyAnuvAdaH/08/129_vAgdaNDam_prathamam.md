+++
If the guilty person is a good man and has committed a slight offence,
and for the first time, then he is only reprimanded: ‘you have not acted
well, do not do it again.’

If, on being thus reprimanded, the man does not desist, or goes on to
say ‘what is there wrong in this?’—then he is rebuked with such harsh
reproachful words as ‘fie,’ ‘shame’ and so forth.

If he does not desist even when thus rebuked, he should be punished with
fine, in accordance with the Law.

If he does not mind the fine either through folly or pride of
wealth,—then he should be killed. This ‘*death-penalty*’ consists in the
cutting off of certain limbs, etc., and not necessarily in actually
killing the man; as is clear from what follows in the next verse.—(129)
