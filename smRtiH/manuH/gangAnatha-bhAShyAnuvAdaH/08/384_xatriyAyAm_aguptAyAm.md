For the *Vaiśya* there shall be a fine of five hundred, if he has
intercourse with an unprotected *Kṣatriya* woman.

For the *Kṣatriya* also there shall be the same penalty; or he may
suffer ‘tonsure’—shaving of the head with ass’s urine.

The same punishment is applicable to both the *Vaiśya* and the
*Kṣatriya* for having intercourse with an unprotected *Vaiśya*
woman.—(384)
