The present verse shows by what sort of purchase real ownership is
produced.

‘*Vikraya*,’ ‘*market*,’ is the place where people sell their goods. If
one obtains from the market, some property,—goods put up for sale, in
the shape of cattle and the rest,—or the price is paid for it,—‘*he
acquires it*’— by ‘*legal purchase*,’ by paying the proper price,—‘*in
the presence of witnesses*’—in the shape of intermediaries and brokers;
and thus ‘*he acquires it*,’ and does not forfeit it. If the thing has
been purchased from one who is not the rightful owner of it, then the
property is restored to the rightful owner, and the *bonafide* purchaser
obtains the price he had paid from the person who had sold it to him. In
the event of his purchase being not *bonafide*, he is punished and also
forfeits the property. This is what is thus asserted—‘The purchaser
proves his *bonafides* by producing the seller, the rightful owner
receives the property, and the king receives the fine paid by the
seller, the purchaser receives back the price he had paid from the
purchaser’ (*Yajñavalkya*, 2.170).

This same idea is set forth in the present verse.—(201)
