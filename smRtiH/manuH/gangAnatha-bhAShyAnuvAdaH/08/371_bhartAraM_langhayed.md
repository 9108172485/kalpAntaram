‘*Passing over*’ means neglecting the husband and going over to another
man; if a woman does this through ‘*pride*,’—the pride consisting in the
idea,—‘I have several relations who are powerful and wealthy, and I
myself am possessed of all the excellent qualities of a woman, such as
beauty and love,—why then should I mind my character?’

Such women the king shall get devoured, till they die.

‘*Place*’—spot; where many people congregate, such as road-crossings,
market-squares and so forth.—(371)
