‘*Unascertainable*’—incapable of being determined, on account of there
being no marks or witnesses available.

‘*The king himself*’— of his own will—‘*shall assign*’—make over—‘*their
lands*’; saying—‘this is your land, that is yours.’

‘*Righteous*’;—this is added with a view to point out that the king
shall not show partiality to any party.

‘*On the basis of advantages*’—*i.e*., according to considerations of
common good ; *i.e*., he shall indicate the boundary between the two
villages in such a manner as to make the decision equally advantageous
to both parties; so that if the field assigned to one party is less in
size, it is of better quality, being more fertile.

The ablative ending in ‘*upakārāt*’ has the force of the participal
affix; the term standing for the expression ‘*upakāram apekṣya*,’
‘taking into consideration the advantages.’

Or, the text may mean that, the land may be assigned to one party, being
taken away from the other party, whose rights over it are doubtful. In a
case where the complaining village is unable to indicate the boundary,
while the other party is able to do it, he shall assign the disputed
land to the latter. In this way a great benefit would be conferred upon
the king himself, as also upon a large number of villages.—(265)
