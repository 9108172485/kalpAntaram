It is not only purchase from one who is not the owner that is
invalid,—but also what is received as ‘*gift*’—a ‘gift’ is that which is
given either as *charity* or as a *friendly present*,—is not valid.

Verse 197 has declared that neither the buyer nor the seller is the
owner of the property; and the present verse denies the ownership in
cases where it may be considered as having been acquired, in accordance
with the law that—‘one becomes the owner, through inheritance, purchase,
partition and gift’ (*Gautama*, 10.39).

Such is the rule of judicial proceedings, and it should not be
transgressed.—(199)
