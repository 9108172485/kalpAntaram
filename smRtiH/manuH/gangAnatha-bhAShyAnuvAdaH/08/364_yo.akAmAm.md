What is stated here is only by the way.

‘*Of equal status*’—belonging to the same caste as the girl.

If he ‘*violates an unwilling maiden*’—*i.e*., deprives her of her
virginity, through sexual intercourse,—he should be killed on the same
day, without delay.

In the case of the willing maiden, there is no real ‘violating’; how
could there be any possibility of death being inflicted? We shall
explain later on what should be done in such a case.

Though in the present text only the man ‘of equal caste’ has been
mentioned, yet from considerations of the castes of the parties
concerned, death also would be inflicted in certain cases.—(364)
