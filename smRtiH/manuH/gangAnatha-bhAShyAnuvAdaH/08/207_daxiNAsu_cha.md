The sacrificial fees are paid at the ‘Mid-day Extraction’; if a priest
gives up his work after that, the fee paid to him shall not be refunded;
he ‘*should receive it*’—*i.e*., he should not be made to refund it.

The work should be completed by the sacrificer, through another person,
paying him an additional fee. This has been added with a view to
preclude the following notion—“Everything in connection with sacrifices
should be done by *priests*,—persons become *priests* when they have
been appointed as such,—this appointment can be made only at the
prescribed time, which is before the commencement of the performance, so
that if an appointment were to be made during the performance, it would
become defective,—and yet the performance has got to be finished,—and if
it has to be finished in a defective form, I shall get only those
details performed which can be done by the priests other than the one
who has gone away.” The sense is that only that much of deficiency has
to be admitted as cannot be avoided; and every little detail that can he
done should be done.

Some people have held that the verb ‘should be got done’ is to be
construed with the ‘priest’; the meaning being that the sacrificer shall
pay to the remaining priests higher fees and get the abandoned work done
by them, if he cannot do it himself; but, as before the payment of the
final fee, the burden of finishing the performance rests with the
sacrificer.—(207)
