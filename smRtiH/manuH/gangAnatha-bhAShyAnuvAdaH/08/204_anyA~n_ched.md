Since the present context is dealing with matters relating to sales, it
lays down certain rules relating to maidens given in marriage for a
price.

At the time of receiving the price, if the man shows a beautiful girl,
but after having received it, he gives an ugly one, or one not of proper
age, or of inferior qualifications,—then for that same price, the
bridegroom shall marry both the girls.

The rule here laid down pertains to the case of girls only, that
relating to similar frauds in connection with the selling of cattle and
other goods shall be laid down later on.—(204)
