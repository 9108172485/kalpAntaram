When the debtor, on being summoned to the King’s Court, admits the debt
as legally due by him, saying—‘I do really owe this to him,’—then
‘*i.e., deserves five per cent*.’ ‘*as fine*’;—this has to be added. By
this rule, the man is to be fined the twentieth part of the amount of
debt claimed. The man deserves this fine on account of his having
transgressed the law by not satisfying the creditor’s claims outside the
Court and thereby forcing him to come up to the king.

When the man commits a further transgression by denying the claim,
saying—‘I do not owe anything to this person,’—then, on the claim being
proved, the man is to be fined ‘*twice* as *much*’; *i.e*., double of
five per cent.; *i.e*., ten per cent.

‘*Such is the ordinance of Manu*’—Prajāpati; *i.e*., the Rule or Law
propounded by him from the very beginning of creation.

Others have explained the term ‘*as much*’ as referring to the total
amount of the claim, *i.e*., double the sum that is due to the debtor;
as it is only thus that the syntactical connection with the term
‘*debt*’ is maintained; otherwise there is a syntactical split; and as
no different subject has been mentioned, if it referred to the same
subject, then the result would be an option.

This however is not right; for the double of the amount of debt would he
too much. Even though the subject is not definitely mentioned, yet on
account of juxtaposition, it is only right that it should be taken as
referring to ‘*five per cent*.’—(139)
