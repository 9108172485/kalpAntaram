The text has used the term ‘*twice-born person*’ with a view to preclude
*Śūdras*.

‘*On a journey*’—*i.e*., not an inhabitant of the same village;—hut
there also he should be one ‘*who has run short of provisions*’—*i.e*.,
whose journey-rations have been exhausted.

‘*Two sugar-cane stalks*’ and ‘*two roots*’;—these are mentioned only by
way of illustration, indicating small quantities of green vegetables,
*mudga* -grains, leguminous grains and so forth. Says another
Smṛti-text—‘There is no prohibition regarding leguminous grains,
cucumber and grass.’

‘*From another man’s field*’—*i.e*., from a place belonging to another
person;—even though it be within an enclosure.—(341)
