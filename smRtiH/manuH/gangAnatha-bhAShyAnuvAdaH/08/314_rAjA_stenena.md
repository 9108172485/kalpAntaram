In as much as nothing is specified, the ‘*thief*’ here is to be
understood as one who has stolen *gold*; specially as it is only in the
case of such a thief that other Smṛti-texts have laid down the
‘approaching of the king.’ The present text itself cannot be taken as an
injunction laying down the act of ‘approaching’; because the
subject-matter of the present context consists of the injunction of
punishments for theft, as clearly declared above in Verse 301—‘I am now
going to expound the law relating to punishments for theft.’ Hence the
present can only be taken as a *re-iteration* of the act of
‘approaching’ (enjoined elsewhere); hence it must mean that ‘one who has
stolen gold should approach the king’—‘*with flying hair*.’

‘*Wise*’—courageous.

Another reading for ‘*dhīmatā*,’ ‘*wise*,’ is ‘*dhāvatā*,’ ‘*running*.’
‘*confessing*’—proclaiming his crime on the road—‘*i have done
this*’—act of stealing brāhmaṇa’s gold—inflict upon me the proper
punishment.’—(314)
