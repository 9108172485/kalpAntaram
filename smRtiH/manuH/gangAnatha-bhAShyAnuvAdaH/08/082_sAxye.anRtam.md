The preceding verse encourages the witnesses by putting before them the
spiritual and temporal results following from the telling of truth; the
present verso describes how results accrue from saying what is contrary
to truth; and the purpose of this also is to induce the witness to tell
the truth.

‘*Sākṣya*,’ ‘*evidence*,’ is the work of the witness; in that work,
stating what is not true, the man becomes ‘*bound*’—tormented—‘*in
Varuṇa’s fetters*,’—‘*firmly*’—to a very great extent;—‘*helpless*’—
rendered totally dependent on others, even in regard to the operations
of speech and the eyes,—‘*during a hundred births*.’

‘*Varuṇa’s fetters*’ are in the shape of terrible snakes or in the form
of the disease of *dropsy*.

In order to guard against such calamities, the witness should state the
truth;—such is the sense of the injunction implied by the text.

In the term ‘*ājātīḥ*,’ the initial *ā* is not the indeclinable ‘*āṅ*’
which denotes *limit*; for, if it were that or we would have the
Ablative ending. Hence it is to be taken as a preposition meaning
nothing; just like the preposition ‘*pra*’ in such words as
‘*pralambate*’ and the like. The case-ending also is the Accusative.
What the term signifies is *repetition*; the meaning being that the man
sutlers from dropsy repeatedly during one hundred births.—(82)
