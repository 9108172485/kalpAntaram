‘*Conversation*’—talking; one who is found to be doing this;—if he
happens to be one who has been ‘*previously accused of*’—blamed for
committing—‘*such offences*’—of having a love-intrigue with that
woman,—*i.e*., if the man is of unsteady character, and has been already
seen to be carrying on an intrigue with her,—or has been suspected of
doing so;—‘*secretly*,’—in some secret place, or (as some people
explain) in a place where such conversation is forbidden;—in the case of
such a person, even if the conversation held with another’s wife be one
bearing upon some business, be should be made to pay the ‘*first
amercement*.’—(354)
