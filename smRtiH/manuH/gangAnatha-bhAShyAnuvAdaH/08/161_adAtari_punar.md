Having raised a question by means of the present verse, the Author
answers it in the next verse: and the grounds for doubt are expressed by
means of the two words ‘*other than that for payment*’ and ‘*whose
character is fully known*’;—the three words with the locative
ending—‘*adātari*,’ ‘*pratibhuvi*’ and ‘*vijñātaprakṛtau*’ being
construed together.

‘*By what means would the Creditor seek to obtain his dues*?’—Should he
seek to obtain it entirely by his own operations? Or should he also urge
the surety’s son?

“Why should there be any such doubt, when it has been distinctly
asserted that in the case of the death of sureties other than that for
payment, the sous shall not be liable?—what connection then can the sons
have with such dues?” The doubt arises because the surety is one ‘*whose
character is fully known*’; which means that it is fully known that the
man had received payment for becoming ‘surety ’; and this fact, being
known, might give rise to the idea that his sons should be liable; since
it is possible that the amount paid to the surety was for the purpose of
paying off the debt in question.

The particle ‘*punaḥ*,’ ‘*then*,’ serves to distinguish the present from
the preceding verse; the meaning being—‘if the liability falls upon the
sons of the surety for payment only, then in the case of the death of
one who is surety *not for payment*, from whom would the creditor, after
his death, seek to obtain his dues?’

The rest has been already explained.

‘*Parīpsā*’ is *seeking to obtain*.—(101)
