The phrase ‘*out of arrogance*’ of the preceding verse has to be
construed with this verse also.

If the *Śūdra* lays hold of the Brāhmaṇa’s hair, with a view to insult
him, his hands should be cut off. The dual number has been used for the
purpose of indicating that even when the catching is done with a single
hand, since the pain caused is the same as that in the case of catching
with both hands, it is *both* the hands that shall be cut off, and not
*one* only.

‘*Dāḍhikā*’ is *beard*.

In the case of other parts of the body also, the catching of which
causes the same pain as the catching of the neck and other limbs
mentioned, the punishment shall be the same as the one here laid down.

‘*Unhesitatingly*’;—this forbids any consideration regarding the exact
amount of pain caused by the catching,—whether it has been much or
otherwise. The sense is that the punishment is to be inflicted for the
mere *catching*.—(288)
