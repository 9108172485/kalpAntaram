‘*Goods*’—Household articles,—such as the winnowing basket, the mortar,
the jar-platform, the pot and so forth,—or things in connection with
which no special punishments have been laid down.

The ‘*damage*’ to these consists in destroying their original shape,
even though they still continue to be of use.

‘*Intentionally or unintentionally*’;—there is no distinction to be
made, whether the injury is done by chance, carelessness, or
intentionally.

He shall ‘*give satisfaction*’ to the owner of the goods, either by
offering to him another article of the same kind, or by paying him the
price of the damaged article, or by apologising. And to the king he
shall pay the price of that article.

To this rule, there are some exceptions’ (and these are noted
below).—(288)
