If there arises any neglect regarding the safe keeping of the cattle,
‘*during the day*,’— such as those going to be described under
232,—‘*the responsibility*’—blame—‘*rests with the keeper*’; and he has
to bear the blame

‘*During the night*,’ the blame lies with the owner,—if the animals die
while tied up;—‘*if in his house*,’—if they have been safely penned in
the house by the keeper.

‘*If otherwise*,’—*i.e*., if they have not been brought into the house
during the night, and have been kept in the pastures,—the blame lies
with the keeper.

The meaning is as follows:—During the time that the cattle are under the
charge of the keeper, if they graze in the cultivated field of a man, or
if they are killed,—the fault lies with the keeper; but if anything
happens after they have been made over to the owner, then it lies with
this latter.

As the blame is in connection with *non-safety*, the term
‘*yoga-kṣema*,’ ‘*safety*,’ should be taken as figuratively indicating
its opposite; just as the epithet ‘beautiful-eyed’ is applied to a blind
man.—(230)
