What the witnesses state naturally in regard to the case should he
accepted; on the other hand, what they state, not quite naturally, but
‘*from considerations of righteousness*’ ‘*is useless*’,—*i.e*., should
not he accepted. The describing of things exactly as they were seen is
what is meant by ‘*natural statement* what is otherwise than
this,—*i.e*., what is stated with the motive that what is said may not
cause suffering to the poor party concerned,—‘*is useless*’; *e.g*.,
when one party complains—‘I have been insulted by this person’—and the
other denies it, the witness may say—‘yes, ho was insulted, but in joke,
not through malice’; and in this case, the statement ‘the man has been
insulted’ should he accepted; while the qualifying statement ‘in
joke,’—which had not been put forth by the defendant—and was made by the
witness unasked (gratuitously)—need not he accepted.

‘*In relation to the case*’—pertaining to the suit.

‘*Useless*’—futile.

Others explain the verse as follows:—It may so happen that through
shyness, a witness deposes in a halting manner,—but that alone need not
be made a ground for rejecting his statement; what is to be done is that
the nature of the witness should he examined by reasoning, and then it
should be determined that ‘this person speaks haltingly through shyness,
what he says, however, is quite true?

But the real meaning is as explained above; so much attention need not
be paid to this other explanation.—(78)
