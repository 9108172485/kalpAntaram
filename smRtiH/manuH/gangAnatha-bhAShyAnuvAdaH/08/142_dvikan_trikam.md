From the four castes, *Brāhmaṇa* and the rest, respectively, he shall
charge the four rates, two per cent, and so forth. These four rates are
sanctioned in relation to the four castes respectively.

‘*Just*,’—*i.e*., not exceeding by even a half or a quarter. This term
has been added to preclude the idea that the expression ‘two per cent.’
may be applicable to ‘two and a quarter’ or ‘two and a half.’ Just as
the shortest alteration, even by a single syllable, of a name makes the
name a totally different one (so the addition of even a quarter would
make the rate totally different).

This also is an alternative open to the man who cannot maintain his
family at the former rate of interest; or to one who has only a small
capital; or to cases where the borrowers are not specially righteous
persons.

The propriety of this would be analogous to the act of doing a righteous
act with the money extorted from wicked persons.

For ‘*samam*,’ ‘just,’ another reading is ‘*samām*.’

This rate of interest however is to be charged for one year only, and
not beyond that; as the rates being high, the principal might become
more than doubled.—(142)
