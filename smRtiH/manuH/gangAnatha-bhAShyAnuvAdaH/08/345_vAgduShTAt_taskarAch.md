This is another declamation eulogising the injunction of punishment.

‘*Wicked of speech*’;—he who offends with words.

‘*Taskara*’ is a thief.

‘*With a staff*’— the ‘*staff*’ stands here for anything that hurts, any
weapon.

In comparison to all these three kinds of offenders, dealt with in the
three foregoing sections, the one going to be dealt with now is the
worst.—(345)
