The term ‘*pāñcamāṣika*’ means ‘that of which *five māṣas* is the
measure’; since the substance is not mentioned of which there shall be
‘five māṣas,’ the most reasonable conclusion is to take the mean,
*i.e*., a substance of medium quality; hence it is ‘*five māṣas*’ of
*silver* that is meant; so say some people.

But the right view is to take it as referring to *gold*; and in this
sense the present assertion does not militate against anything that has
been said before with regard to its being ‘equal to it’ (?)

The final conclusion is that the exact substance is to be determined in
accordance with the circumstances of each individual case.—(298)
