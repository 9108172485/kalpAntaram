It has been declared that ‘having entered the Court, he shall look into
the cases.’ As regards the word ‘*sabhā*,’ in ordinary language it is
used in the sense of a particular apartment of the house; *e.g*., in the
Mahābhārata it is said that the ‘excellent gold-burnished *sabhā* was
built by Maya—sometimes it is also used in the sense of an assemblage of
particular men. In order to preclude these two meanings of the term, the
author states the definition of the ‘*Sabhā*,’ ‘Court,’ meant in the
present context.

That place where three Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda are brought
together, as also the learned Brāhmaṇa appointed by the king,—or the
person mentioned in the preceding verse,—that is the ‘*Sabhā*’ meant
here.

The name of ‘*Brahman*’ has been mentioned for the purpose of extolling
the Court; the sense being that ‘the Court constituted as here stated is
as unexceptionable as that of Brahman himself.’—(11)
