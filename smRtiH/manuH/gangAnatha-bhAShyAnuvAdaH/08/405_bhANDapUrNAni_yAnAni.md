‘*Commodities*’— goods, such as clothes, grains and so forth; when carts
are laden with these, they should be made to pay the ferry-toll, in
accordance with their ‘value.’ If they are laden with doth and other
things of great value, they should pay heavily; while if they are
carrying only grains and other cheap things, they should pay less.

Similarly the toll to be paid may be regulated in accordance with the
lesser or greater difficulty involved in crossing a particular river.

Carts not laden with commodities may pay ‘some *little trifle*’—*i.e*.,
a *paṇa*.

The term ‘*commodity*,’ ‘*bhāṇḍa*,’ here stands for *riches*.

Those men who are without any luggage shall pay, not half of the
*quarter-paṇa* (as laid in 404), but any little trifle, more or less;
and no bard and fast rule can be laid down on this point. Such is the
sense of the scriptures.—(405)
