‘*Will*’— wish; and ‘*by his own will*’ means ‘without filing his suit
with the king,’ just as he pleases,—not necessarily by the four
sanctioned methods of acquiring property;—if he is complained against,
and summoned by the king’s officers,—and then if the debtor, on being
questioned, should admit the debt, saying ‘I owe him such and such an
amount,’ then the latter should he fined a quarter of that debt, and the
total amount due he should be made to pay to the creditor ; *e.g*., if
he owes a *hundred*, he should he fined *twenty-five*, and should pay to
be creditor a *hundred*. We should not fall into the mistake that *a
hundred* less *twenty-five* is to be paid to the king and the balance,
*i.e*., twenty-fire to the creditor; as in this case the punishment
would fall upon the creditor and not upon the debtor.—(176)
