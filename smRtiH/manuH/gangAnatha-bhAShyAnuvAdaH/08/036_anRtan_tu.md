But when the man, who has made the statement ‘this treasure was hoarded
by me, or by my forefathers,’ fails to prove this,—then being a liar, he
should be fined the eighth part of what his own property may be,—or a
smaller fraction of that same treasure-trove, it is not necessary that
he should he made to pay in the same metal, gold or otherwise, as that
which has been found; he may pay in some other metal of equal value to
the former; the exact amount of the fine being such as does not ruin the
culprit, and yet teaches him a lesson.

The option is based either upon the peculiarity of the attendant
circumstances of each case, or the qualities of the person concerned.
That this is so is indicated by the fact that the latter punishment is
lighter than the former one, which is excessive. Thus then, where the
man is possessed of a large property, and the treasure concerned is
small, there the fine shall not be in proportion to the latter; in this
case the fine shall be in proportion to the man’s property; the former
would be too little (to be a deterrent).—(36)
