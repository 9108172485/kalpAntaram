Being ‘*summoned*’— called, complained against, and let off on
security,—‘*and questioned*’— in the presence of the King, either by the
judge or by other members of the Court—‘Do you, or do you not, owe this
amount to this person?’—if the man denies it; ‘*then he shall he c*
*onv* *icted*,’—proved to be wrong—‘*by* *the man seeking for his
due*’—*i.e*., by the person who is desirous of proving that the sum had
been really lent by him,—‘by *means of at least three witnesses*’;—the
compound ‘*tryavara*’ means ‘*of whom three is the least number*,’ the
term ‘*avara*’ standing for the minimum; the meaning being that if they
are to be fewest, they should he *three*; otherwise they should he more
than three;—*in the presence of the King and the Brāhmaṇas*.’

An objection is raised:—“The witnesses are naturally to be questioned
before the persons by whom the case has begun to be tried; why then
should it ho asserted that this has to be done *in the* *presence* *of
the King and the Brāhmaṇas*?”

There is no force in this. It is just possible that the witnesses might
be questioned by deputing a trustworthy person to go to them; hence with
a view to emphasise that the witnesses should be questioned personally
by the trying persons, it has been reiterated here.—(60)
