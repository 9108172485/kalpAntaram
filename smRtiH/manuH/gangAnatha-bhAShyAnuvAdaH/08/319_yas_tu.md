A place where people drink water is called ‘*prapā*,’ ‘*water-drinking
establishment*,’ the place where water is stored after having been drawn
from a reservoir.

The exact nature of the substance is not stated—of what substance the
fine of a ‘*māṣa*’ shall consist. It should he regarded as being copper
or silver.

The article—rope and the rest—ho shall restore ‘*to the place*’ and not
to the king.—(319)
