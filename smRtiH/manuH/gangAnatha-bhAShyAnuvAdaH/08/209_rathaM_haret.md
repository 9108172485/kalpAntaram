At the rite of Fire-laying the *Adhvaryu* shall take the chariot; and
the *Brahman* or the *Hotṛ* shall take the swift horse.

In certain rescensional texts, these form the ‘sacrificial fee’ for the
rite of Fire-laying.

At, the rite of ‘Soma-purchase,’ there is a cart, which is to be taken
by the *Udgātṛ*. To this cart one calf is yoked, and another unyoked:
and it is on this cart that the purchased *Soma* is carried. Others hold
that the rites laid down in connection with the ‘purchase of Soma’ have
some transcendental purpose, and their use does not lie only in the
obtaining of the *Soma*; because there is no new character produced in
the *Soma* by its being purchased in the peculiar manner prescribed.

This verse has described how the fees prescribed in connection with the
subsidiary details are to be distributed among the several persons
concerned; the next verse is going to describe the rule concerning the
distribution of the sacrificial fee prescribed in connection with all
rites in general.—(209)
