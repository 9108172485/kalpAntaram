If a man, having his wealth reduced, is unable to pay the doubled
principal, he should be made to renew the contract, and to ‘*change*
*the deed*’—*i.e*., the document properly attested. But he should pay
the interest that has already accrued.

This is an exception to what has been said as to the creditor not
receiving more than double of bis principal;—since the loan-transaction
remains in force.

“How does it follow that there is an exception to the non-exceeding of
the double?”

Because in this case there is nothing to show whether further interest
accrues upon the principal along with the accrued interest, or upon the
principal only; all that is mentioned is the ‘renewal of the contract,’
which is explained in other words—‘he shall *change the bond*.’

“If further interest does not accrue on past interest, for what purpose
should the bond be altered?”

The answer is as follows:—When interest has ceased to accrue, and the
money is not paid, there is every possibility of laxity (on the part of
the debtor), and of the witnesses (of the old document), forgetting all
about the transaction; and a debt thus ignored for ten years would
become non-payable; as has been declared in the following text.—‘Where a
document is ignored for ten years, there can be no suit on its basis;
especially in the case of assaults (?).’

This is how it has been explained by older writers.

The following verse (from Nārada, 131) lays down the favour that the
king may show towards the debtor:
