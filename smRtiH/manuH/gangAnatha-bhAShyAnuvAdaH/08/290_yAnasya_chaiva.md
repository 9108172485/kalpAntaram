The present text proceeds to show that in some oases, even though some
damage may be done, it is not regarded as an offence.

‘*Conveyance*’—the cart and so forth, riding on which people go on a
journey. These carts are drawn by bullocks, mules, buffaloes and such
animals. These same animals also, when ridden upon, may be taken as
meant by the term ‘*Conveyance*.’

‘*Rider*’—the driver and other persons riding in the cart.

‘*Owner of the conveyance*,’—the person to whom the conveyance belongs.

By the force of the running wheels of these carts, or by that of the
horse or other animals pulling the cart on the

road, some damage or death may be caused; and all such cases would come
under the law relating to ‘owner and keeper’ laid down in verse 229 *et
seq*. But in all these, the fault lies sometimes with the rider,
sometimes with the owner, sometimes with both, sometimes with no one;
and these details not having been dealt with on the previous occasion,
they are taken up now.

‘*Exclusions*’—*i.e*., cases where there is no punishment for the
injury; and which therefore are not regarded as offences to be
penalised.

‘*For the rest*’;—*i.e*., for cases other than those just, enumerated,
penalties are prescribed; and these are now going to be described.—(290)
