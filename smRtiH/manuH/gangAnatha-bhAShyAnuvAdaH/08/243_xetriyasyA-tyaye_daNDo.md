If there has been some ‘*transgression*’—fault—on the part of the farmer
himself, in connection with In’s farm,—such as untimely sowing, sowing
of unripe seed, damage to the crops by his own cattle, harvesting before
ripening, and so forth,—then the man should be fined ten times the
amount of the king’s share.

If without the farmer’s knowledge, the wrong has been done by the
servants employed by him—in the shape of night-watchers and others,—then
these servants shall be fined half the aforesaid amount.

The construction is—‘*atyaye kṣetriyasya daṇḍaḥ*.’

This has been set forth here in the present context, because it deals
with cultivated fields.—(243)
