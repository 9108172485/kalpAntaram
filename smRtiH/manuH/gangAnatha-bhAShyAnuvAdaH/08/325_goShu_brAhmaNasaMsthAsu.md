‘*Belonging to Brāhmaṇas*,’— kept by Brāhmaṇas, owned by Brāhmaṇas;—for
stealing such cows;—the Locative ending in ‘*goṣu*’ has the sense of the
Genitive.

‘*Animals*’—goats, sheep and so forth. No significance is meant to be
attached to the plural number in the words here used.

‘*Immediately*,’—at the very moment; without hesitation.

‘*Ardhapādikaḥ*,’ ‘half-footed’;—‘*ardhapāda*’ means *half of the foot*;
and he who has only half of his foot-left is called ‘half-footed’; and
one becomes so only if half of his foot is cut off. Hence what the
sentence means is ‘that half of the thief’s foot should he cut off.’

‘*Kharikā*,’ ‘goad,’ is that by which oxen are driven in chariots or
fields.—‘*Piercing*,’—causing pain by driving with the goad. The term
‘*piercing*’ has been explained by the older writers as standing for
*driving*; and certainly the man causes pain to the animal by *driving*
it. Others hold that the punishment laid down is to be inflicted only
when the *driving it* done *with the goad*.

Others explain the term ‘*Kharikā*’ as meaning the *hind quarters of*
the animal. (And what would be punished, ac cording to this
interpretation, would he *the piercing of the hind* *quarters of cows*.)

If however ‘*Kharikā*’ is taken as standing for the cow that has the
evil habit of running away,—then the keeper or someone else who pierces
such the cow, should be made ‘half-footed.’

Others interpret the Locative in ‘*goṣu*’ literally, and explain the
words as referring to the theft of cows and other products of the milk
of cows, by supplying additional words.

But this cannot he right. For so long as sense can be made out of the
words as they stand, why should any additional words be supplied?—(325)
