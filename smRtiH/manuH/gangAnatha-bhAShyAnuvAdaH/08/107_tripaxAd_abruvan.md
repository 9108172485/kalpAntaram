Fifteen days and nights make a ‘*fortnight*’; the aggregate of three
fortnights is called ‘*tripakṣam*’; according to Pāṇini 2.4.17, the
compound should have a feminine ending, but this is precluded by the
exception that follows, regarding ‘*pātra*’ and other words (which
include the word ‘*pakṣa*’ also).

“In that case the feminine form ‘*tripakṣī*’ should be impossible.”

The wrong gender in that case is to be regarded as a ‘Vedic anomaly.’

The Ablative ending in ‘*tripakṣāt*’ has the force of the participial
affix ‘*lyap*.’

The meaning of the verse thus is that—‘He who after *having waited for*
three fortnights, dees not give evidence, without being ill, should hear
the burden of that debt’;—‘as also the tenth part out of it, as a
penalty.’

‘*Debts and other mailers*’;—the addition of the phrase ‘and other
matters’ indicates that what is said here applies to all kinds of suits;
and the repetition of the term ‘debt’ is only by way of illustration.
The meaning is that—‘in a suit where for the said time no evidence is
given, the burden of the defeated party is to be borne by the
witnesses.’

‘*Gada*,’ ‘*illness*,’ is meant to indicate other kinds of disability
also; so that due cognizance should be taken of such conditions also as
family troubles, fear of creditor and so forth.

The term ‘*bandha*’ following a numeral word, denotes *penalty*, and
stands for the ‘tenth part.’

The terms ‘*naraḥ*’ and ‘*sarvataḥ*’ are added only for filling up the
metre.

Others explain that the assertion ‘*should hear that debt*’ means that
‘he incurs the sin of stealing the amount of the debt.’

The meaning is that the man shall pay the tenth part of the fine that
would be payable to the king by the defeated party.—(107)
