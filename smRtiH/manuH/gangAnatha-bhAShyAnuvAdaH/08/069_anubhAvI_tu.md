‘*In the interior of a house*,’—any sudden act that may be committed, in
the shape of defamation or assault or incest or theft or other
crimes;—*in the forest*—if any of the said crimes are committed;—or when
the body is hurt by robbers or by other similar persons, and property is
robbed;—or when some one has stood security for a debt, but there are no
witnesses to it; or even though there were any, they could not wait till
the time of the trial;—or when the debt is repaid in private;—in all
such cases, any person ‘*who may be cognisant of the facts*’— who may
have witnessed the transaction in question,—there being no restriction
as to caste, or of similarity of standing and the like.

The phrase ‘*in the interior of a house’ stands* lor a secluded place in
general; so that uninhabited temples and such places also become
included. The mention of the ‘*forest*’ also indicates the same thing.

Others have explained the clause ‘*śarīrasyāpi vātyaye*’ to mean ‘when
the entire structure of the case is going to fall through, any man can
be cited as a witness’; *i.e*., when a case having been instituted is
going to fall through, and there is no chance Of its being
re-instituted, then there should be no restriction as to the caste, or
sex, or age, or rank or relationship and the like. This is what is
further explained in the following verse.—(69)
