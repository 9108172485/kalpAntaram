‘*Vānaspatyam*’ stands for *trees*, ‘*vanaspati*’;—the affix having the
reflexive force. When this is taken ‘*for feeding cows*,’ it is not
‘theft.’

‘*Roots and fruits*’—of trees; as also lotus-roots, corns and so forth.

Under verse 326 *et seq*., punishment has been prescribed in connection
with ‘roots and fruits,’ along with ‘yarns’ and other things,—when taken
for purposes other than the feeding of cows. Hence when the act is here
said to be ‘not theft,’ it refers only to cases where they are taken
‘*for feeding cows*.’

According to another Smṛti-text however, punishment has got to be
inflicted in a case where the man is not suffering from any actual
shortage, and he takes the things through sheer childishness; specially
when they are within an enclosure. Says Gautama (12.28)—‘Fruits and
flowers one may take as his own, of tre.es that are not enclosed.’

‘*Fuel for fire*’;—if the man who has set up the fire finds no trees
near him, and finds that the fire would be extinguished, if he takes
fuel for keeping it alive, there is no harm in this, he might supply the
lire with fuel consisting of leaves; but in a village where leaves are
not available in large quantities, if he takes some fuel, there can be
no harm in this.

‘*Grass for cows*’;—the Dative in ‘*gobhyaḥ*’ means ‘for the sake of.’

In as much as the text specifies this, it would be wrong if the grass
were taken for the purpose of making mats.

Some people hold that the term ‘grass’ itself indicates that it is meant
for *cows*. But for them there would be no justification for the
presence of the term ‘*for cows*,’ ‘*goḥbyaḥ* (*gobhyaḥ*?)’ (with the
Dative); as in that case the Genitive would be the right form.—(339)
