In this connection some people assert that what is stated hero is in
reference to the *Śūdra* who has volunteered, through religious motives,
to be a slave.

This however is not right; as there is nothing to show that it refers to
any particular case. Hence what is meant is that the Brāhmaṇa may take
the wealth of the *Śūdra* who is the slave of all.

‘*Confidently*’—without hesitation. He should never have any such doubt
as to how he can seize the *Śūdra’s* goods, such seizing being
forbidden. Since there is no property that really belongs to the
*Śūdra*. Specially because in such cases the *master* is not deprived of
his possession; since the *Śūdra* acquires property only for the purpose
that his master may make use of it. Hence the Brāhmaṇa should seize the
goods ‘*confidently*.’ Even where it is presented by the *Śūdra*, he
should use it as if it had been in his own house.

It is only when there is actual need that this can be right. Hence it is
only when the Brāhmaṇa has no property of his own that he incurs no sin
by seizing the goods of his *Śūdra-slave*.—(417)
