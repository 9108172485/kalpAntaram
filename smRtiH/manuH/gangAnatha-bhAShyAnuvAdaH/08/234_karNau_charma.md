When, on the expiry of their lives, the animals have died, the ears and
other limbs should be made over to the owner.

The ‘*concrete bile*’ is a powder obtained from the horns of cows.

‘*Bladder*’—is a particular part of the body.

‘*Marks*’—such as ‘cleft ears’ and the like, which serve to distinguish
the animals;—these should be pointed out.

In this manner, does the keeper become absolved from blame.

By seeing the marks the particular animal becomes identified.—(234)
