Some people think that the punishment here laid down is meant for the
case where mendicants and the rest first mentioned carry on the
conversation, even after being forbidden.

This however is not right. It has been said that these men are not to be
forbidden. Then again, how could the fine of a ‘*suvarṇa*’ be imposed
upon a mendicant?

Hence the person meant to be fined one ‘*suvarṇa*’ is one who, even
though not previously accused, has been forbidden by the woman’s
husband, and yet goes on conversing with her.—(361)
