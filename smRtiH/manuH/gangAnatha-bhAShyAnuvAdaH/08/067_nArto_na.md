‘*Afflicted*’—by the death of relatives and friends.

‘*Intoxicated*’—senseless through wine.

‘*Demented*’—seized by epilepsy, or obsessed by ghosts.

‘*Tormented by hunger or thirst*’—Suffering from the pangs of hunger or
thirst.

‘*Fatigue*’—caused by much physical labour, involved in walking long
distances, engaging in battle and so forth;—‘*oppressed*’ by it.

‘*Love*’—Desire for intercourse with women. One who is separated from
his beloved, as also one who is too much with her,—both of them are
untrustworthy, on account of their mind being engrossed in the loved
one, or in the fear of being separated from her.

‘*In rage*’—who is too angry with some person,—even other than the
parties of the suit; such a person having his mind entirely taken up
with rage is unable to perceive things rightly, or to remember them
correctly.

‘*Thief*’;—even though the thief also is ‘*one who adopts a forbidden
occupation*,’ yet since ho has been mentioned separately, it has to be
explained on the analogy of the expression ‘*go-balīvarda*’ (‘cows and
hulls’).—(67)
