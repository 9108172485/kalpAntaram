‘*The genital organ*’—male and female. Here the places are only named;
the exact form in which the punishment is to be inflicted on each
‘place’ shall be described later on. If, with reference to any ‘place,’
no particular form of punishment has been prescribed, the law is that
the culprit shall suffer by that limb whereby he may have committed the
wrong. Hence in cases of incest, punishment is inflicted on the genital
organ;—in theft it is inflicted upon the stomach, in the form of
starvation, etc.;—in the case of defamation, on the tongue, and in that
of assault, on the hands;—when he trespasses with his feet, it is to be
inflicted on the feet;—if he openly and fearlessly stares at the king’s
wife, his punishment is inflicted on the eyes,—by smelling the
(forbidden) odour of sandal-paint, he is punished on the nose;—if he
should be found listening behind the wall or the curtain, while the king
is holding secret council, the punishment should fall on his
ears;—punishment regarding ‘*property*’ is well known;—the killing of
the ‘*body*’ is done only in the case of the gravest offenders.—(125)
