‘*Bounds of morality*’—*i.e*., moral laws based upon scripture and the
usage of cultured men; he by whom those are ‘*not heeded*’—*i.e*., who
transgresses them.

‘*Disbeliever*’—who holds that ‘there is no higher world,—there is
nothing in charity—nothing in sacrifices.’

The former—‘who heeds not the bounds of morality’—is one who acts
against the law, through hate and other passions (and who does not hold
wrong opinions), while the latter is one who *deities* the law, and
adheres to principles contrary to it.

‘*Extortionate*’— he who extorts money from the people, by illegal fines
and such other means.

Similar to him is ‘*he who does not afford protection*.’

‘*Such a king one should regard as doomed to perdition*,’—*i.e*., as
going to sink into hell before long.

Another reading for’ the last quarter is ‘*asatyañca nṛpam
tyajet*’;—which means that if a king says one thing and does another,
and is thus, ‘*untruthful*,’— him ‘*one should abandon*,’—*i.e*., one
should not live in the realms of such a king.—(309)
