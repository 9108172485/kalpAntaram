‘*Strayed*’—the cattle that has disappeared from sight, and one does not
know where it has gone to.

‘*Destroyed by worms*’;—Worms called ‘*ārśaka*’ enter through the
genital organs of the cow and kill it.

‘*Killed by dogs*’;—this is mentioned only by way of illustration; so
that the same rule applies to the case of cattle being killed by
jackals, tigers and other wild animals.

‘*In an unsafe place*’;—such as holes, pits, stony places and so forth.

All this ‘*the keeper shall make good*.’—‘*if it has been left without
human aid*.’—The ‘human aid’ in such cases would consist in remaining
near the cattle and lighting the stick for keeping away wolves and other
animals; and when they are left without all this care. In a case where
the man, himself on the point of death, is unable to scare away the
tiger—or where if the cattle, running fast, happen to fall into a pit,
from which it could not be turned back by the keeper, even when he would
be following it,—no fault can lie with the keeper.—(232)
