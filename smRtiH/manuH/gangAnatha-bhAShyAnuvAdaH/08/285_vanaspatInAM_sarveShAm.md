The ‘*trees*’ have been mentioned as representing all immovable things.

When injury is done to a tree which is of great utility, the fine
consists of the ‘highest amercement’; when the tree is of ordinary
utility, it consists of the ‘middle amercement’; and when it is of small
utility, it consists of the ‘lowest amercement.’

Account has also got to be taken of the part of the tree where the
injury is done;—whether it is the leaf, the fruit or the branch that has
been cut off. In regard to fruits also, their market-value has to be
taken into consideration.

Similarly account has to be taken of the position of the tree,—whether
it stands on the boundary, on road-crossings or in a hermitage, and so
on.—(285)
