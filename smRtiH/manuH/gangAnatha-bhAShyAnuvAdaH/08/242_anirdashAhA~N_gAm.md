The present verse lays down an exception to what has been said above.

Since the text speaks of the ‘*cow*,’ it follows that, in the case of
other animals, such as the buffalo and the like, the wrong done is
cognisable. The term ‘*vṛṣāh*’ stands for *bulls*.

‘*Dedicated cattle*,’—such cattle as have been selected by a sacrificer
for being used at an impending sacrificial performance. Or the term
‘*deva*’ may stand for the images of Viṣṇu, Śiva or other Gods installed
within brick-structures; and such ‘cattle’ as may have been presented to
these ‘Gods’ would be called ‘*dedicated cattle*’; as in such cases
there would be a relation of possession and possessed between the ‘Gods’
and the ‘cattle.’

What is declared here pertains to such cattle as serve as ornaments of
temples; and not to those that are only brought there for the purpose of
their milk being offered to the temple. Because in the case of the
latter, it is the keepers that offer the milk to the Gods, and hence are
the ‘owners’ of the cattle; so that these have to be regarded as on the
same footing as other owners. On the other hand, those that serve as
ornaments to the temple have been presented to the temple, and as such
come to be regarded as being ‘dedicated cattle.’

Some people hold that the term ‘*vṛṣāh*’ stands for such bulls as have
been let off, in connection with the ceremony of *Vṛṣotsarga*.

Such cattle—whether they be ‘*with keepers*,’ or not belonging to any
one and hence ‘*without keepers*’—are not to be penalised.—(242)
