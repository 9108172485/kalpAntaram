If, on reference to other proofs and to other more reliable witnesses,
it is found that the witnesses have not deposed truthfully, each of them
shall he fined two hundred; because each of them is a ‘witness’ and that
penalty has been prescribed for the ‘witness’; and all the witnesses do
not depose collectively.

‘*Truthful witnesses*’;—*i.e*., witnesses who lay a great stress upon
veracity.

‘*Become purified*,’;—*i.e*., do not incur the guilt of telling a lie.

‘*In the right manner*’;—*i.e*., in accordance with facts. This phrase
cannot be taken as referring to anything that has been *said* (which is
what the term ‘*ukta*’ actually denotes); all that is meant is that what
they declare is corroborated by other proofs. Or, it may mean ‘in
accordance with what has been declared in the scriptures,’ in the way of
truthfulness. It has been declared in the scriptures that ‘one shall
speak the truth’; hence the phrase ‘*yathoktena*’ means *in a truthful
manner*.—(257)
