If two months have elapsed since the last monthly course, it is a sign
that the woman is pregnant, such a woman deserves kindly treatment;
hence no ferry-toll is to be realised from her.

‘*Ascetic*’—belonging to the fourth order.

‘*Hermit*’—living in the forest and performing austerities.

*Brāhmaṇas in holy orders*’— the term ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ has been added as a
qualification; hence the rule does not apply to those who only bear the
garb of asceticism.

‘*Toll*’—fare for crossing, in the form of a ‘*paṇa*’ and so forth.

This they shall not be made to pay.

Having mentioned ‘toll’ already, the author has added the term ‘*at a
ferry-crossing*’ only in consideration of metrical exigencies.—(407)
