‘*Would go to the dogs*’—would be futile, so far as you are concerned.
Others however explain that ‘going to the dogs’ is indicative of
positive harm; the sense being—‘the merit of the man becomes thrown
away, in the same manner in which a man, having earned, with great
difficulty, gold and other excellent treasures, were to throw it all
into an unclean stream’: it has been pointed out more than once that the
merit acquired by one person cannot go over to another.—(90)
