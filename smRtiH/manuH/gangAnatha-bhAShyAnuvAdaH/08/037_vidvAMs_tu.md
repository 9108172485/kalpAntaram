When a learned Brāhmaṇa finds the treasure that bad been buried by his
forefathers—father, grandfather and so forth,—then ‘*he shall take it
wholly*,’ and shall not hand over to the king the aforesaid part of it.

In support of this the text adds a supplementary exaggeration—‘*as he*
is *the master of everything*,’—as has been declared under 1.100.

The rule here laid down applies to the case where the treasure belongs
to the Brāhmaṇa; when however its rightful owner is not known, then,
even though it may have boon found by a ‘*learned Brāhmaṇa*,’ the king’s
share has to be paid; as it is going to be declared (in 39) that—‘of all
ancient hoards...... the king is entitled to one-half.’—(37)
