The king obtains the sixth part of the spiritual merit arising from the
open performance of sacrifices by the inhabitants of villages, as well
as by those living in forests; so also the sixth part of the ‘demerit’
acquired by the secret acts of stealing and the like committed by
thieves and others. It is not only by his failure to protect those who
are robbed by thieves that the king incurs sin, but also by his failing
to suppress those who, by committing theft and such other misdeeds,
incur sin, a portion whereof falls upon the king. Because ‘protection’
also means saving them from the incurring of sin. So that if the king
fails in this duty of his, it is only right that he should incur sin.

“In as much as the protection rendered by the king is in return for what
he receives as wages (in the way of taxes), it is not right, to say that
he obtains the sixth part of the people’s spiritual merit.”

It has already been explained that there are many persons who pay no
taxes at all,—such as the poor, the orphans, the ascetics and so forth.
So that if the king fulfills his full duty, what incongruity is there in
the assertion made in the text?—(304)
