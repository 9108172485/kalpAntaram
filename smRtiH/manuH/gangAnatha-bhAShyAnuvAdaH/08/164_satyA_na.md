Words expressive of something to be done is called ‘*Bhāṣā*,’
‘*contract*’ in general; and what is there laid down should be done.

“Is it meant that no contract is valid?”

No; that only which is ‘*contrary to law*,’—that is regarded as
‘contrary to law,’ ‘illegal,’ which is opposed to practice sanctioned by
the scriptures; *e.g*., interest more than five per cent., the selling
of wives and children, the giving away of one’s entire hereditary
property and so forth.

‘*Even though fully substantiated*,’—*i.e*., reduced to writing, or
pledged by a surety, and so forth;—it is ‘*not valid*’

^(‘)*Custom*’—practice sanctioned by
usage;—‘*established*’—long-standing, not modern.

This verse is supplementary to what has gone in the preceding verse,
regarding the invalidity of gifts and other transactions effected by
dependent persons and by persons not in their senses and so forth.—(164)
