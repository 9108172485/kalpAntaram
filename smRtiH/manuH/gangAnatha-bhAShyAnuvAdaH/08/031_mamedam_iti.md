The author explains in what, manner the rightful owner shall establish
bis ownership over the lost property.

Whenever any one comes and says ‘this is my property,’ ‘*he should be
questioned* *in* *proper form*.’—‘*Questioned*,’ *i.e*., examined.

“What is the *proper form* of questioning?”

The questioning could be done in the following manner:—What is the
article that has been lost? Of what colour? Of what size? What is the
number of things? Was it dropped or not dropped? If it was dropped, at
which place was it dropped? Whence did you obtain it?

If he gives a correct account of the colour, number and other details;
‘*colour*’ of animals, clothes and the like: ‘the cow or the cloth lost
was white’; similarly the ‘*number*’: ‘there were ten cows or yokes.’
‘Other details’—such as, *e.g*., if it was gold what was its weight, if
it was in a lump or a definite shape. If he gives a correct account of
all this, then he establishes his ownership, and as such ‘*ought to
receive the property*.’

An ‘account’ is called ‘correct,’ when it is found that what it
describes is in exact agreement with what is known by other means of
knowledge.

The mention of ‘colour, number and other details’ is only by way of
illustration, and; implies also the producing of witnesses and other
evidence of ownership.—(31)
