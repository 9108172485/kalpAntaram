If he sprinkles urine on his superior, or passes urine in his presence,
with a view to insult him,—then, even though the urine may not actually
touch the man, yet, in as much as he insults his superior with
‘urination,’ the penis shall he cut off.

This same rule applies to the case of *semen*; as the effect is the same
in this ease also.

‘Spitting’ consists in letting the fluid pass out of the nostrils or the
mouth. Hence if it is done through the nostrils, it is the nostrils that
have to be cut off; in accordance with what has been said (under 279)
regarding the punishment to be inflicted upon that limb with which the
offence has been committed.

‘*Breaking wind*’—is making an improper sound with the anus.

All this is to be punished, when done ‘*out of arrogance*’ and not when
done by chance.—(282)
