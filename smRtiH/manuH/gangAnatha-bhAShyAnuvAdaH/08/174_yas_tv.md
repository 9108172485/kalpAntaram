If the king ‘*deal with eases unjustly*,’ it is only ‘*through folly*’
that he neglects the Law; and the fruit of this transgression is that
his people having become disaffected, ‘*his enemies bring him under
their control*’;—when the people become disaffected, they become a lot
of angry, greedy, frightened and ill-treated persons, and are easily won
over by his enemies, who, thereupon attack him, capture him, strike at
him and take away his kingdom;—this is what is meant by ‘*bringing under
control*.’— (174)
