In a dispute over the possession of land, *eg*., when several witnesses
have been cited in proof of possession, if some depose to possession by
the plaintiff, while others to that of the defendant,—then the king
shall accept the statement of the majority.

When the number on both sides are equal, he shall Accept the statement
of those ‘*possessed of superior qualifications*,’—*i.e*., of a larger
number of qualities, or of a single quality, but in a very large degree,
very much to the benefit of mankind.

When there is a conflict between two equally qualified witnesses,
preference has to be given to the higher caste.

Lastly, when both sets are equal in all respects, then recourse should
he had to ordeals, or some other similar means of discrimination.

‘*Accept the majority*’—*i.e*., accept as true the statement of the
majority.

‘*Conflict*’—making contradictory statements.—(73)
