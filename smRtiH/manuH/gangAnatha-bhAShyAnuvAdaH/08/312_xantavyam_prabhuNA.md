‘*Partisans of litigants*,’—*i.e*., the relations and friends of the
plaintiff and the defendant. When one of the parties is imprisoned, his
father or mother may ‘*abuse*’— cast aspersions upon, or curse—the king;
then he should forgive them.

Also the litigants themselves, when they happen to be ‘*young or aged or
infirm*.’

In this manner his own welfare becomes accomplished. This
‘accomplishment of welfare’ is the fruit of obeying the injunction
‘shall forgive.’—(312)
