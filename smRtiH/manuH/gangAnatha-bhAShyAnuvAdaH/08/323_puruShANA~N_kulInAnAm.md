‘*Noble*,’—born of good families and possessed of learning and other
good qualities.

‘*Specially women*,’—snoh as are possessed of good qualities, beauty and
grace.

The particle ‘*ca*,’ ‘*and*,’ indicates that ‘*nobility*’ and the other
qualifications are meant, as far as possible, to be applicable to both
‘men’ and ‘women.’

‘*Precious gems*,’—such as diamond, lapis-lazuli, emerald and so forth.

Here also it is to be understood that the articles stolen should he
equivalent in value to ‘a hundred of gold’; otherwise, since the
qualification ‘precious’ is a relative term, there would be no
definiteness in the rule prescribing the punishment.

‘*Deserves immolation*’;—the exact meaning of ‘immolation’ is to be
determined in all cases by the peculiarity of the circumstances of each
individual case.

In the case of the stealing of men and women who are not ‘noble,’ or of
gems that are not ‘precious,’—there shall be a fine eleven times the
value of what is stolen.—(323)
