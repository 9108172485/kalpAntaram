The term ‘*wife*’ is applied to the woman who has gone through the
sacrament of marriage.

Persons other than one’s own self are called ‘*others*.’

‘*Intercourse*’ here stands for *carnal enjoyment*, consisting in
embracing and other acts. ‘Embracing’—consisting in the two parties
coming together in close contact,—the cultivating of the feeling of
pleasure caused by mutual union,—the sending of messengers and so
forth,—and the actual sexual act,—all these are included under the term
‘*abhimarṣa*,’ ‘*intercourse*.’

The meaning thus comes to be this:—When the king finds that a certain
man is addicted to having intercourse with the wife of another
person,—he should ‘brand’ him,—by cutting off his nose, for instance,—by
means of ‘*terror-inspiring*’—sharp-edged weapons,—and then ‘*banish*’
him.

In as much as penalties in connection with each detailed act hare been
laid down elsewhere, the present verse should be taken as referring, not
to a single act, but to repeated acts; and the right thing appears to be
that the ‘banishment’ here prescribed,—which is not applicable to any
other act—has to be inflicted along with a fine in money, the purpose
served by which is wholly different. All this we shall explain later
on.—(352).
