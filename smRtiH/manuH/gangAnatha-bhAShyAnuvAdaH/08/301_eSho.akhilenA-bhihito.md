‘*The law relating to assault*’—the rules regarding punishments—has been
fully *explained*. The term ‘*daṇḍa*’ as occurring in the name of the
‘head of dispute’ (*daṇḍapāruṣya*), has been used as indicating the
weapon of assault (*stick*).

After this I am going to expound the several kinds of penalties to be
inflicted on the thief.

This verse serves the purpose of introducing the next head.—(301)
