When, as a matter of fact, a man is really learned, one may say ‘this
has not been properly learnt by him’; or he may defame his learning by
declaring—‘what he has learnt is not right.’

With regard to one who regards himself as an inhabitant of Brahmāvarta,
he may say ‘he is a foreigner.’

With regard to a real Brāhmaṇa, he may say ‘he is a Kṣatriya’; or
through friendship he may call a *Kṣatriya*, ‘*Brāhmaṇa*.’

‘*Occupation*’;—the ‘student’ may be called ‘one who has finished his
studies.’

In regard to one’s ‘*bodily details*, ho may say ‘he is suffering from
skin diseases,’ when, in reality, the man has no defects at all.

‘*Falsely* ’;—‘*false*’ is what is a lie. The instrumental ending being
used in accordance with Pāṇini’s rule ‘*Prakṛtyādibhya upasaṅkhyānam*.’

Or ‘*falsity*’ may stand for *unrighteousness*; and it is only right
that *unrighteousness* should be regarded as instrumental in defaming
other persons.

‘*Through arrogance*’;—‘*arrogance*’ stands for *disregard for others*.
So that if the assertions in question are made through ignorance, or in
joke, there is no harm.

“For whom is this penalty laid down?”

We say—for all castes. Others however hold that, since the context
pertains to the *Śūdra*, it must be regarded as meant for the *Śūdra*
falsely defaming a twice-born person.—(273)
