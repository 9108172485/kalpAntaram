“On what basis do we have the instrumental ending in *gobījakāñcanaiḥ*?
If it be said to be due to these being *instruments* in the act of
*questioning*, that cannot be; as it is the word (and not the kine,
etc.) that are the *instruments*, a means of questioning.”

There is no force in this objection. We have to construe the words in
such a manner as to make the ‘kine,’ etc., instruments of the
questioning. The word ‘*pātakaiḥ*,’ ‘*sins*’ has got to be construed
both ways, so that we have the phrase ‘*gobījakāñcunaiḥ pātakaiḥ*,’
which gives the meaning that ‘he should ask them by mentioning sins
pertaining to the kine, grains and gold,’ *i.e*., the form of the
question to be employed should he—‘if you tell a lie, you would he
incurring the same sin that follows from stealing or killing the cow.’

Similarly, by mentioning the sins going to be enumerated (in the next
verse), he should question the *Śūdra*. The term ‘*sin*’ here should he
taken as standing for *words expressing sins*; because the sins
themselves could not be the *means or instrument* of the *questioning*,
as pointed out above.—(88)
