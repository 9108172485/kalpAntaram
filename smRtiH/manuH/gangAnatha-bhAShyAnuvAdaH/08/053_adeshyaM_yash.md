It has been said before that on the debtor denying the debt, the
creditor complains to the King ,—*i e*., the complaint shall be lodged
in the form—‘At such and such place, at such and such time, such and
such an amount of money was borrowed from mo by this man’;—and on being
questioned, he may say ‘I was not at the place at the time,’ referring
to the place and time that have been alleged by him as those at which
the money was borrowed: and in this case he ‘mentions the wrong place.’
Or, the term ‘*deśa*’ may stand for the *witness*; and the text means
‘if he cites as witness a person whose presence at the time and place of
the transaction is impossible.’

Having alleged the place, time, etc., ‘*if he retracts*,’—saying ‘I did
not say this.’

He who does not understand that his ‘*previous statement*’—what he had
alleged before—and his ‘*subsequent statement*’—what he alleges
afterwards—are ‘*contradidory*’;—or if he does not realise the
discrepancy in his own behaviour.

‘*Such a person shall be declared to have failed*’—this verbal clause
(occurring in verse 57) has to be construed with each verse (from 53 to
57).—(53)
