This text is in the form of a corollary. the meaning is that the
Brāhmaṇa who derives his livelihood from thieves should he punished like
a thief.

‘*Even by sacrificing and teaching*’;—the term ‘even’ indicates other
acts also; so that *accepting gifts* and friendly presents, etc., also
become included.

Of the *Kṣatriya* and other castes, the means of living are other than
these; such as trade and the rest. So that to their case the rule would
apply if they received the property of thieves in the course of such
transactions.

The Brāhmaṇa has been specially mentioned, with a view to prevent the
possibility of his entertaining such ideas as ‘I have acquired this by
the lawful me ms of sacrificing for the man.’

‘*Who has taken what was not given to him*’—*i.e*., the thief.

‘*Seeks to obtain*’—wishes to acquire.

If even though he may not have actually received the sacrificial fee,
yet, he should he punished like a thief, simply on the ground of his
having associated and having had dealings with a thief.—(340)
