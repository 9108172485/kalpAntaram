The term ‘*jar*’ is used in the sense of a particular measure, and not
in that of one *jarful* only. The exact quantity is sometimes 20 seers,
and in others 22 seers according to the custom of the place.

He who steals more than ten ‘jars,’ should be punished with
‘immolation.’ This rule is relaxed in accordance with the circumstances
attending each case.

‘*In* *the rest*,’—*i.e*., in the case of ten jars and less,—the fine
shall be eleven times the quantity stolen.

‘*The property shall be made good to the owner*’;—this applies to all
cases of theft.

‘*Grain*’—under this term are included seventeen things—the *Vrīhi*, the
*Yava* and so forth,—as mentioned in the *Smṛtis*.—(320)
