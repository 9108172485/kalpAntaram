‘*Goats and Sheep*,’—‘Sheep’ also includes the wild goat.

When these have been ‘*surrounded* *by* *wolves*’—jackals and the
rest—and they are not killed outright at the very first onset,—so that
there is time to come forward and rescue the animals,—and yet ‘*the
keeper does not come forward*’—to rescue them; under such circumstances,
if the wolf should ‘*forcibly kill any*,’— the blame lies with the
keeper. That is, he should he made to make it good to the owner, and
also perform an expiatory rite.

Cows are large animals, and hence cannot he ‘surrounded’ by jackals,
etc.; hence the present verse has specified ‘*goals and sheep*’; it does
not follow that the rule applies to these animals only; so that this
same rule applies to the case of young calves also.—(235)
