Verse 180 has laid down the rule regarding *deposits*; and the present
verse lays down what is to be done in the case of other transactions.

In the case of debts, friendly loans and sales, the restoration or
repayment should be in the same manner in which it had been contracted.
So that if it has been given privately, it should not be made public by
seeking for re-payment through a court of justice; and when a loan has
been given on the strength of a document written by the debtor alone,
then its payment should not be sought for through court. If this were
done, the creditor’s property should be made to suffer.

The case of deposits also being covered by this same rule, the addition
of a rule in regard to them separately is meant to indicate that in
their case the rule is *absolute*; hence in the case of transactions
other than deposits, when effected in private, if subsequently suspicion
should arise regarding the possibility of dispute, it may he right and
proper to make it public.

Or the repetition may he justified on the ground that what is done in
the present verse is the prohibition of making public what has been done
in private, while in the preceding verse what has been said concerns
‘sealed or open deposits.’

The term ‘*mithaḥ*’ means ‘*in private*,’ or ‘*mutually*’ As all
transactions are done between two parties, the addition of this adverb
is meant to deny the presence of a third party.

‘*Dāya*,’ ‘*Trust*,’ though a generic term, stands here for transactions
other than ‘deposits,’—such, for instance, as *sale* and the like.—(195)
