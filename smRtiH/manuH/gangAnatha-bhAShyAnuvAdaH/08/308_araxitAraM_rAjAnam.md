This verse is a deprecatory supplement to what has gone before.

‘*Affords no protection*,’ and ‘*devours*’—*i.e*., lives upon the
people, by taking the royal dues. this same idea is stated more
clearly—‘*grabbing his tribute.'*

Such a king, all cultured men declare to be the ‘*imbiber of*’—who draws
upon himself—‘*fifth*’— sin—‘*of the whole people*’—of all his subjects.
That is, such a king is befouled by the sins of his people.—(308)
