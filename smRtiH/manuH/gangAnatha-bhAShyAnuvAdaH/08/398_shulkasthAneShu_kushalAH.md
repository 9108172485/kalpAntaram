‘*Custom houses*’ are those places where duties and tolls are realised,
as fixed by the king and the merchants in accordance with the special
conditions of each country. Those who have experience of these are the
‘custom-house officials’; these men cannot be hoodwinked by clever
rogues.

Similarly there are men who are ‘*experts in all kinds of merchandise*,’
*i.e*., who know all about the demand and supply, the good and bad
qualities and such details regarding all commodities.

When things are brought by merchants in boxes from other countries, the
said experts fix their prices; and of this price the king shall take the
twentieth part.

“What is the use of the valuation? It would be enough to say that the
king shall receive the twentieth part of each commodity.”

This would be all right in cases where the king realises his dues *in
kind*. But in the case of such cloth-pieces as are used in the form in
which they are sold, the twentieth part could not be taken without
tearing each piece. Hence it is that valuation becomes necessary.

In the case of unsaleable commodities, or of articles meant for personal
use, there are no duties, hence the text adds the term ‘*yathā-paṇyam*,’
‘*saleable commodities*.’

The valuation has to be done in accordance with several considerations
of time, place and other circumstances; for instance, all commodities do
not sell at the same price at all times; so that the price of any
article cannot be regarded as fixed for all time.—(398)
