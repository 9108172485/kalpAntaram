‘*Saptāhāt*,’ ‘*within a week*,’—the use of the Ablative implies that
the proposition ‘before’ is understood. That is, on anyone of the seven
days, after he has given evidence, if the witness is found to suffer
from sickness, it implies that he has been adjudged by destiny to be a
perjuror, and hence he should be punished in accordance with the
aforesaid rule.

‘*Illness*’ stands for any kind of acute suffering;—‘*fire*’ for the
burning of cattle and conveyances;—and ‘*death of a relative*’ for the
death of the son or the wife or some other near relative;—all these
being indicative of his having given false evidence.—(108)
