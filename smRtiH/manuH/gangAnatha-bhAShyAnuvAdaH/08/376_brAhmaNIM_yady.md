‘*Unprotected*’—has been explained as one who has lost her chastity and
has no one to look after her.

For having intercourse with such a woman, he shall ‘*commit*’ the Vaiśya
‘*with fine hundred*.’ The verb *to commit* is to be taken in the sense
of *fining*, from the context; the meaning is that ‘he shall be fined
live hundred.’

The term ‘*pañcaśutam*’ is to be expounded as ‘he who has live
hundred,’—the Bahuvrīhi compound denoting *possession*.

The meaning is that the king should so commit him that *he gets five
hundred*.

“Does this mean that if the man has more than five hundred, the excess
shall he confiscated?”

Not so, we reply; for in that case if the man has only five hundred,
then for him there would be no punishment prescribed.

“What I hen is the meaning?”

The expression ‘*he shall he committed with five hundred*’ means that he
is to be punished with a fine consisting of five hundred. That such is
the meaning is indicated by the context.

Similarly, ‘*the Kṣatriya is to be committed with one
thousand*’;—*i.e*., his punishment shall consist of one thousand; and
*not* that his property at home shall he one thousand.

The expression ‘*aṅgasarvasvī*’ (in verse 371) is to be explained
similarly to mean that (he king shall so act that the man’s punishment
consist of his limb and bis whole property.

The penalty for the *Kṣatriya* is severer, because it is his duty to
guard people; so that if he offends, his guilt is the greater.—(376)
