‘*Assesors*’;—though the caste of these persons is not specified here,
yet in view of the *Brāhmaṇa* being mentioned later on (in 11), and also
of the phrase ‘*along with Brāhmaṇas*’ (in *verse* 1 above), it follows
that these also should be *Brāhmaṇas*.

The number is mentioned as ‘*three*’ simply with a view to preclude the
possibility of only one or two men being appointed: what is meant is
that three or more men shall be appointed. This we shall explain in
detail under the section dealing with *Witnesses*.

‘*Shall enter the excellent Court*.’—Though entering the court as the
king’s representative, he shall stand or sit on such a seat as is proper
for himself. The repetition of ‘standing or sitting’ serves either to
indicate the right posture for him, or to preclude other postures. The
meaning of this is that he should not sit upon the king’s throne.—(10)
