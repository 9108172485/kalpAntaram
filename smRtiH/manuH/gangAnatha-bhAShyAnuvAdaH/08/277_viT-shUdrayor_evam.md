‘*Of the same kind*’—*i.e*., the lowest and the middlemost amercements,
mentioned in the preceding verse. The order should be as follows:—when
the *Vaiśya* abuses the *Śūdra*, he shall be fined the lowest
amercement, and when the *Śūdra* abuses the *Vaiśya*, he shall be fined
the middle amercement.

‘*The inflicting of the punishment shall be the same, barring
mutilation*’;—This includes the ‘cutting off of the tongue’ laid down in
verse 270.

‘*According to their respective castes*’— This should not be understood
to mean that the said fine is to be inflicted when they abuse men *of
their own caste*; the meaning is that the fine shall be in accordance
with the castes mentioned. The sense of the verse is that when these men
abuse men of their own castes, the punishment shall be as laid down
before.

‘*Inflicting*’—Promulgating.

When the *Kṣatriya* abuses the *Vaiśya*, the fine shall consist of half
of the lowest amercement; the same scale shall apply when the *Brāhmaṇa*
abuses the Vaiśya and the Śūdra.—(277)
