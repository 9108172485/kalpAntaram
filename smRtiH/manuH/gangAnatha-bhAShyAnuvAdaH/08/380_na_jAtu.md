‘*In all crimes*.’—What is said here should not, on the strength of
context, be taken as applying to ‘adultery’ only; it pertains to other
crimes also.

‘*Even*’—This term means that even though the Brāhmaṇa may have
committed all the crimes simultaneously, he should never be made to
suffer the death-penalty.

“What then should be done to the criminal?”

The king shall ‘*banish him*’—send him away—‘*from the kingdom*’—out of
his realm;—‘*with all his property*’—along with all his
belongings;—‘*unhurt*’—in body.

“If the property even is not to be confiscated, what would be the
punishment to the Brāhmaṇa?”

Some people say that when the text distinctly says that the man is to be
banished ‘with his property,’ it is clear that it forbids the imposition
of fine. Others however explain the words ‘banished with his property’
to mean that he shall be banished after all his property has been
confiscated.—(380)
