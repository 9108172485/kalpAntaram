In the course of dealing with fields, etc., this additional law is here
added.

‘*Intimidation*’—has been mentioned only as an example, of the methods
of misappropriation employed; the meaning is that—‘if a man knowing the
field to belong to another person, takes possession of it, he shall he
fined five hundred.’

‘Middle amercement’ (which is 500) having been already mentioned in the
preceding verse, its reiteration here is meant to indicate that the
amount shall vary according to the methods of misappropriation. Or it
may be, as some people hold, that in the preceding verse, no
significance is meant to be attached to the exact number.

The man appropriates another’s property by such intimidations as—‘I
shall file a suit and have him punished by the king,’ or ‘I shall have
him robbed by thieves,’ and so forth; and in this case the fine shall he
five hundred, while in other oases, it is to be some other form of
it.—(264)
