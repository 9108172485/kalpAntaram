‘*Pala*’ is the name, and ‘*gold-piece*’ the thing named, ‘*four*’ is
its qualifying adjunct.

‘*Two kṛṣṇalas*’ is the thing named, and the compound term
‘*Silver-Bean*’ the name.

“What the text declares is that when we come to ascertain the exact
measure of the ‘*Bean*’ in connection with silver, we have to understand
it us being equal to ‘*two guñja-berries*.’ Now this makes the measure
indefinite.”

It is in view of this that the text has added the epithet ‘*of equal
weight*’; *i.e*., the two are to be held on each pan of the
weighing-scale, without any other kinds of measure. The sense of this
epithet has to be explained on the same lines as that of the epithet
‘*middling*’ (in verse 134); and its use lies in the fact that if
unequal beans were meant, the weight would remain indefinite.—(135)
