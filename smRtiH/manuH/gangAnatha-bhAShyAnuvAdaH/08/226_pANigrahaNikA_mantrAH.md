‘*Pāṇigrahaṇa*’ is *marriage*, *the taking of a wife*; in connection
with the ritual of marriage, there are certain *mantra* - *texts*—such
as ‘*kanyā agnimayakṣata*, etc.’ (‘the virgin offered a sacrifice to
Agni’)—which indicate that it is *virgins* alone that can undergo the
ceremonies of marriage. In fact, the very *injunction* of marriage
itself says—‘one should marry a virgin,’ and it is this that is
reiterated in the *mantra-texts*; and the mere fact of the term
‘virgin,’ being found in these *mantra-texts* could not be regarded as
indicative of the restriction of marriage to *virgins* only; and this
for the simple reason that mantra-texts, by their very nature have no
injunctive force.

The same idea is further emphasised by means of a negative
assertion—‘*and nowhere among men, to non-virgins*.’—That is, in no
Vedic text is marriage with a *non-virgin* found to be mentioned.

‘*Excluded from religions acts*’— In as much as such girls would not be
entitled to help in the performance of the *Agni-hotra* and other rites,
or in the proper begetting of children, they are not fit for being
married.

For this reason, when a man calls a *virgin* a ‘*non-virgin*,’ he should
be punished with a heavy fine. This is what is meant by the adding of
the present verse after what has been said in the preceding one.—(226)
