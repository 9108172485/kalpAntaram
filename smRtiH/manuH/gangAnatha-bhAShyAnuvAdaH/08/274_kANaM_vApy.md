‘*One-eyed*’—he who is deprived of one of his eyes.

‘*Lame*’—who is without one leg.

‘*Something else like this*’—*e.g*., a cripple, flat-nosed and so forth.

‘*Even truly*’;—the term ‘*even*’ implies the false defamation also,
*i.e*., when one who is not one-eyed is called so.

The fine in this case shall be ‘*at least one Kārṣāpaṇa*’—*i.e*., if,
through mercy, the lowest fine be meant to be imposed, a *Kārṣāpaṇa*
should be the lowest amount of it. Otherwise, the flue should be two,
three, four or five *Kārṣāpaṇas*, according to the character of the
accused.

This rule may be taken, as before, as referring to either all men, or to
the *Śūdra* only.—(274)
