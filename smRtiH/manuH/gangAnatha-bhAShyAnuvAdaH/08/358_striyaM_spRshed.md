‘*Improper place*,’ for touching, would he one where the man could pass
along without touching the woman; there would he no harm in large
crowds.

Or ‘*place*’ may stand f or *part of the body*. There can be no wrong in
the man happening to touch the hands, or the shoulder, or the back, when
taking down a load from her head: whereas it would be very wrong to
touch her lips or chin or breasts and such other parts.

Or, when touched by her, pressed with her breasts for instance, if the
man does not resent it, by saying ‘do not do this.’

‘*By mutual consent*’;—the act is wrong only when done intentionally;
and not if he touches her during sacrificial and other
performances,—when, for instance, the woman hangs by the neck of the
man, or when the man touches the woman between her breasts, or when he
touches her when taking something from her hands and so forth. This
being due to chance,—just like the case where one desiring to fall back
upon dry ground, falls in mud,—the parties incur no guilt at all.—(358)
