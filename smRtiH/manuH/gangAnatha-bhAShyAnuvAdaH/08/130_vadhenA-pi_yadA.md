If actual killing were meant by ‘death-penalty,’ then what would be
there that could not be done by it? How too would the penalty not
restrain a crime?

On persons not resuming good behaviour after being rebuked, ‘—fine’ and
the ‘death-penalty,’ *i. e*., corporal punishment, should be conjointly
inflicted. If, even after corporal punishment, the man does not desist,
the king shall not ignore him,—under the impression that he has already
inflicted the legal punishment,—but he shall inflict actual
‘death-penalty.’

The present verse has been added with a view to indicate that the matter
of *fines* and *death-penalty* is going to be taken up again later on.

As regards verbal punishment, it being too gentle, who would mind it? If
the man has been punished with a fine, and even then does not desist,
the ‘death-penalty’ shall be inflicted in the form of *the cutting off
of the fingers* and so forth, as described below under 9.277.—(130)
