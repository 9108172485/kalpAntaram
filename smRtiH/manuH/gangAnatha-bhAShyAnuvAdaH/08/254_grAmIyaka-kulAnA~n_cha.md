Though a village contains innumerable inhabitants, yet, as a rule, only
two men—one from each of the two villages—become parties to a
boundary-dispute; and it is in the presence of these two men, as also in
that of ‘*an* *assembly of villagers*,’—*i.e*., a concourse of the
inhabitants of the two villages,—that ‘*witnesses regarding boundaries
should be questioned*.’ At the time that witnesses are being examined,
all the villagers should he present as interested in the case; and it is
not open to either of the two persons to say—‘the dispute is between us
two persons, why should these men remain here?’

Or, the meaning may be, that, when a few very old inhabitants of the
neighbouring villages have been called as witnesses, it is necessary
that other inhabitants also of those villages should he present; since
the latter would have heard of the exact boundaries from the older
people, so that, if examined in their presence, the witnesses would not
lie.

‘*Boundary-marks*.’—When there are marks in support of the contention of
both parties, the decision is to be arrived at with the help of the
deposition of witnesses. And in cases where there are no marks at all,
the witnesses are questioned regarding the boundary itself.—(254)
