title = "383 सहस्रम् ब्राह्मणो"

+++
The Brāhmaṇa approaching the protected *Vaiśya* or *Kṣatriya* Woman
should be fined one thousand; and of course ‘banishment’ and ‘branding’
remain as the fixed forms of punishment (in all cases of adultery).

For approaching a Śūdra woman, the *Kṣatriya* and the ‘*Vaiśya* should
be fined one hundred.

‘*Sāhasra*’ is the same as ‘*Sahasra*,’ the affix ‘*aṇ*’ having the
reflexive-force. Or ‘*Sāhasra*’ may be explained as *that which consists
of a sahasra or thousand*; the ‘*aṇ*’ affix having the force of the
possessive.—(383)
