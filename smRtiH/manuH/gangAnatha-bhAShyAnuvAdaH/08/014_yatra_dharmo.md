‘*Justice*’ is decision arrived at in strict accordance with the
scriptures, reasoning and local customs;—if this is

‘*destroyed by Injustice*,’—*i.e*., set aside by the reverse of
justice,—by either the plaintiff or the defendant;—similarly where
‘*truth is destroyed by falsehood*’—by the witnesses;—and all the time
the judges and the other people in the Court remain looking on, and do
not try to draw out the real facts,—then these men also are
‘*destroyed*,’—*i.e*., become as good as dead corpses. This is meant to
be a deprecation of the judges, etc.

For these reasons the members of the Court shall not connive at any
misrepresentations being made by the parties or by the witnesses.

In as much as the mention of ‘Justice and Injustice’ only, or of ‘Truth
and Falsehood’ only, would have been sufficient, the mention of both
would have to be regarded as serving the purpose of tilling up the
metre; hence it has been explained as referring to two distinct sets of
persons (the parties and the witnesses).—(14)
