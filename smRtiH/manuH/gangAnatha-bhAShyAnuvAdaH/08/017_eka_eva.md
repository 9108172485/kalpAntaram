What has been declared in verse 15 is that Morality or Justice should
not be perverted, through *fear*; and the present verse declares that it
should not be perverted through *love* either.

In as much as Morality (Justice) is the ‘only friend,’ it is for this
that one should cultivate it. Ordinary men often abandon their friends
even during life; even in the case of those that are very great friends,
the friendship lasts only till death. Morality on the other hand,
follows the man even when dead. Therefore even for the sake of
friendship, one should not either pervert justice or connive at its
perversion.

In this sense there is the following saying—‘Wife, son, friends, riches
and wealth—all these are lost when the man’s body is destroyed; it is
Morality alone which never abandons him; hence one might abandon his
sons and wife, but never Morality.’

Everything else, in the shape of wife, son and so forth,—except
Morality—perishes with the body; *i.e*., except Morality nothing is able
to save the man on death; so that even for the sake of friends and
relations, Morality should not be abandoned.—(17)
