By means of the explanation of the term ‘*vṛṣala*,’ the judge who
perverts justice is censured. The title of ‘*vṛṣala*’ (low-born) does
not apply to one who is so by caste—*i.e*., the *śūdra*,—but he who
‘*commits the violation*’ (‘*alam*’) of the *Bull*, ‘*vṛṣa*,’—*i.e*., he
who showers all blessings;—the particle ‘*alam*’ denoting *violation,
perversion*.

The opinion that such a person is ‘*vṛṣala*’ is held by the gods; if it
is taken as denoting a *caste*, it may be so taken; but the gods are
more authoritative, and they accept the denotation of the term as here
explained.

The mention of the ‘*gods*’ is only a commendatory exaggeration.

For the reason here explained, in all such texts as—(*a*) ‘no *vṛṣala*
should come in during the performance of a *śrāddha*,’ or ‘the *vṛṣala*
thief should be killed,’—the term ‘*vṛṣala*’ should be taken as standing
for the Brāhmaṇa that perverts truth.

Consequently one should not violate Justice, lest he become tainted with
the character of the ‘*vṛṣala*’; the application of this character to
the Brāhmaṇa being a form of deprecation.—(16)
