‘*Veśa*’ is that where people live, a dwelling-house; the house that is
in the front of one’s house is ‘*prativeśa*’; and he who lives in that
is the ‘*prativeśya*,’ ‘*frontal neighbour*’ If we read ‘*prātiveśya*,’
we would add the reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*.’ Similarly ‘*anuveśya* ‘is one
dwelling at the back of one’s house.’

Persons occupying houses on the two sides also are called ‘neighbours’;
hence the two terras ‘*prativeśya*’ and ‘*anuveśya*’ may be taken as
standing for persons occupying houses next, and on both sides, to one’s
own house.

If the man does not entertain these two, after having invited them to
the ‘*festival*’ in his house, in the shape of marriage and the
like,—‘at which *twenty other twice-born persons are invited*,’—then he
should be made to pay a fine of one ‘*māṣa*.’ That this ‘*māṣa*’ is to
be of gold is indicated by its being distinctly specified in another
place.

‘*Worthy*’;—if the frontal and back neighbours are both worthy,—*i.e*.,
neither inimical, nor absolutely unqualified.—(392)
