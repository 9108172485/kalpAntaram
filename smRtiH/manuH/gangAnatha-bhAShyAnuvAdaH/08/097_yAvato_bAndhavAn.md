The present text introduces a section where it is pointed out that the
degree of sin committed by the perjurer varies with the nature of the
matter of the suit.

When this fact is asserted in the form of an address, it serves the
purpose of indicating its importance, when something is said in secret,
it is regarded as some slight matter, not of any importance; but what is
said now is important, and hence should be listened to with
attention,—such being the implication of the hortatory form adopted.

The term ‘*gentle friend*,’ in the singular form, is intended for
*Bhṛgu* alone from among the several whom Manu is instructing.

‘*Yaṣmin sākṣye*’;—the two locatives are not in apposition; the meaning
is—‘the false evidence that is given in regard to a certain
subject-matter’;—so that the locative denotes ‘*matter*,’ while the
locative absolute means something quite different. Or the diversity in
the *evidence* being in accordance with the diversity in the *matter*,
the two locatives may be in apposition also.

The term ‘*tāvat*’ is generally used to denote *extent*; and as *extent*
is of various kinds, the author specifies it as being ‘*by number*.’

‘*In due order*,’—for the purpose of easier understanding; when a
subject is stated in due order, it becomes easily understood. The
‘*order*’ meant here is with reference to the *number*; as it is number
that is going to be described in the following verses.—(97)
