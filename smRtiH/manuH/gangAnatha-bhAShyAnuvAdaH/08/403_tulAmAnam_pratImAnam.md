‘*Scales*’—well known.

‘*Weights*’—Seer, 2½ seers and so forth.

‘*Measures*’—whereby gold and other similar things are weighed.

All this should be duly marked—with the royal sign—on all sides; the
king should himself examine them and mark them with his own seal.

After every six months he should have them re-examined by his officers,
so that no one might tamper with them.—(403)
