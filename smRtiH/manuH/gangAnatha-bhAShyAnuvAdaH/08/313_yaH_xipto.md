title = "313 यः क्षिप्तो"

‘*Men in distress*,’—*i.e*., the man who is punished, or his relations.

‘*Abused*’—reproached.

‘*Forgives*’—does not become angry.

‘*By that act*’—by the act of forgiving.

‘*Becomes exalted to heaven*’—the root ‘*maha*’ (in ‘*mahīyate*) belongs
to the ‘*Kaṇḍvādi*’ group, hence the ‘*ya*’ in the middle of the word.
The meaning is that ‘in heaven he gains an exalted position.’

For this reason, without showing any anger, he shall forgive.

If, however, under the influence of pride, thinking himself to be
all-powerful, he does not condone the abuse, then, by that act he goes
to hell.

The term ‘*men in distress*’ includes *the young and the infirm* also;
since the present verse is supplementary to the foregoing (where these
latter have been mentioned).—(313)
