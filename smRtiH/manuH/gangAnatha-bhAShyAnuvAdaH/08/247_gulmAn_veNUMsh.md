‘*Thickets*’—shrubs growing together in a compact form.

‘*Bamboos*’—*i.e*., such trees as the *Casta Fistula* and the like; as
there are many varieties of these, the text has added the epithet ‘*of
various kinds*.’

‘*Creepers*’—tendrils; those species of grass that have long-extending
roots.

‘*Mound*’—is an artificial raised grass-plot.

The *Kubjaka* being a ‘*thicket*’ (already mentioned before), it has
been specially singled out, on account of its importance.—(247)
