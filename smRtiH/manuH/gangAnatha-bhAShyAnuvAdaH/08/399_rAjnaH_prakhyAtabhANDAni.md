Those commodities that have been ‘*proclaimed*’ to belong to the king’s
monopoly,—*e.g*. elephants in the eastern countries, saffron, silks and
woolens in Kaśmir, horses among the western countries, precious stones,
pearls, etc., among the southern countries; in fact such articles as are
easily obtainable in the dominions of the king concerned, but rare in
other countries. Kings come to a mutual understanding among themselves
regarding all such commodities.

‘*Forbidden*’—*i.e*., those in regard to which the king has ordered that
they should not he exported outside his dominions; *e.g*. during
famines, the exporting of food-grains is prohibited.

‘*Through greed*,’—if some one exports for sale such commodities to
other countries, the king shall confiscate all his property.

This punishment is meant for one who does the exporting with a view to
profiteering, if they are carried for being presented to a foreign king,
then the punishment shall be severer in the form of imprisonment and
other forms of corporeal punishment.—(399)
