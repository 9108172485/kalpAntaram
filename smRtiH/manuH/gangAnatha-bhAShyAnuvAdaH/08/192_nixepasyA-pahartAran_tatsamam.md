The preceding verse has laid down the punishment to be like that of the
thief; under that rule there are two alternatives—corporeal punishment
and fine equal in value to the property involved—to he determined
according to the caste of the accused. So that in the case of castes
other than the Brāhmaṇa, it would, under the said rule, he open to the
king to inflict either of the two forms of punishment. And it is this
possibility that is precluded by the present verse, which restricts the
punishment to *fine* only; so that from among the penalties inflicted on
thieves, what may be added to the *fine* is only *admonition* or
*reprimand*, and not *mutilation* and other corporeal punishments.

It will not be right to take the present verse as precluding corporeal
punishment from the case of Brāhmaṇas, who also would be subject to both
kinds of alternative punishments sanctioned by the preceding verse.
Because corporeal punishment has been already generally prohibited in
the case of Brāhmaṇas;—in such texts as ‘one shall not strike a
Brāhmaṇa’ (8.380).

‘*Upanidhi*’ here stands for what is used through friendship.

‘*In all cases*,’—*i.e*., irrespectively of the nature of the property
or the caste of the person involved.

Others have given a technical meaning to the term ‘*upanidhi*’; but that
meaning is applicable elsewhere, not here. Because, in the absence of
any convention, fixing the technical sense of a term, the right course
is to take it in its ordinary sense. This same ‘*upanidhi*’ is going to
be mentioned again as ‘*friendly loan*’ (under 196).—(192)
