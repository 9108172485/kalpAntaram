Some people do not read this verse as part of the text, on the ground
that there is no difference of opinion regarding the ‘Triad.’

When the sun shines through a window-hole or lattice, we see a particle
of dust; it is this that is called ‘Triad.’

‘*Antara*’ means *hole*.

‘*This is the very first of measures*’— (132)
