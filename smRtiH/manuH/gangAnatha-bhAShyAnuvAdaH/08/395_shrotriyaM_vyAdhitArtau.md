‘*Respecting*’ here stands for *kindly treatment*; verbal roots having
several meanings. No other kind of ‘respect’ would be possible in the
case of the infant and several others. The ‘*Vedic scholar*’ has been
held here to mean the Brāhmaṇa scholar only.

‘*Distressed*,’—by separation from his loved ones or such other causes.

‘*Indigent*’— in reduced circumstances.

‘*The man of high family*’—one who is born in a family endowed with
fame, wealth, learning, bravery and such other qualities.

‘*Gentleman*’—one who is honest and upright of nature.

All these should be received with kind treatment, in the shape of gifts
and honours.

Some people explain the term ‘*indigent*’ as qualifying ‘*the man of
high family*’— (395)
