Judgment should not be perverted, through fear; because justice, when
violated, ‘*blights*’— our prosperity, as also the prosperity of the
sinful party and his helpers.

Similarly, when ‘preserved,’ justice removes dangers from all sources;
so that even though angered, the party (defeated) cannot do any harm.

‘*Hence*’—*i*.*e*., knowing this, that happiness and unhappiness are
based upon morality, one should not violate morality (or justice). If we
violate justice, justice shall, like an enraged serpent, strike back at
us; so *lest justice blight us*—*i*.*e*., with a view to saving
ourselves,—we should preserve justice.—(15)
