‘*Craftsmen*’—artisans; carpenters, blacksmiths, cooks and so forth.

‘*Actors*’—dancers and singers.

‘*Menial servants*,’—those who serve others for a living; known as
‘*dāsa*.’

‘*Money-lenders*,’—who live upon interest on money lent.

These persons, even though they he Brāhmaṇas, should, in the matter of
taking evidence and administering ordeals,—that this is meant is dear
from ‘the context—he ‘*treated*’—*i.e*., questioned—‘*like Śūdras*’; but
not so in other matters. That is to say, in taking evidence, the *Śūdra*
is not questioned with reference to charity, virtue and the like, and in
ordeals, he is subjected to the ordeal by fire; and the same treatment
should be meted out to the persons mentioned here.

Though *ordeal* has not yet been spoken of in the present context, yet
what is said here is taken as applying to the case of ordeals also,
because they are dealt with immediately after the present section, and
immediate sequence also is a basis of relationship; the two subjects
therefore are closely interrelated.—(102)
