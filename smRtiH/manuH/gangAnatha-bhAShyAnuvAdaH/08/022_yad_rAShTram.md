Like the preceding verse this also is a supplementary declaration.

From the context it is clear that ‘*the majority of Śūdras*’ is meant
with reference to the persons pronouncing judgments upon disputed cases;
and the meaning is that—‘where among persons deciding cases there is a
majority of *Śūdras*, such a kingdom *perishes quickly*, through
sufferings caused by famine and disease’; and it follows that from the
destruction of the kingdom follows that of the king also.

‘*Infested with non-believers*,’—*i.e*., inhabited by such persons as
are materialists, denying the existence of other worlds.

‘*Destitute of twice-born people*’;—‘non-believers’ cannot be regarded
as a class distinct from that of *Brāhmaṇa* and the rest; as that would
lead to a cross-division; as has been declared thus—‘Brāhmaṇas and the
rest come to hear the titles of *physicians, traders* and so forth.’ Or,
the expression ‘*destitute of twice-born people*’ may be taken to mean
‘where twice-born persons are not consulted and trusted in connection
with difficulties relating to the Law.’—(22)
