When any property is stolen by thieves, the king should recover it; but
he should not use it himself; he should restore it to the persons that
may have been robbed.

The use of the term ‘*all*’ implies that stolen property shall be
restored to Caṇḍālas also.

If we read ‘*caurāhṛtam*’ (in place of ‘*chaurairhṛtam*’), the compound
should be expounded as ‘*chaurebhyaḥ āhṛtam*’—*i.e*., *recovered from
thieves*—in accordance with Pāṇini 2.1.32. If we adopt the (third)
reading ‘*chaurahṛtam*,’ the compounding would be in accordance with
Pāṇini 2.1.30.

What is meant is that if the property stolen by thieves is incapable of
being recovered, it should be made good by the king out of his own
treasury.

The second half of the verse—‘*By making use*, etc.’—should be construed
as follows:—The participle ‘*upayuñjānaḥ*’—derived from the root
‘*yuja*’ with the preposition ‘*upa*’—should be taken to indicate
figuratively *non-restoration*; the sense being that ‘if the king does
not restore to the person concerned the property that is his due, and if
he uses that property for his own purposes’, then it is said to be
‘retained’ by him; and ‘*by retaining such property the king imbibes the
sin of the thief*,’—‘*kilviṣa*’ meaning *sin*.—(40)
