‘*Lust*,’— sexual love: when females happen to be parties to the suit,
the person who loves one of them, deposes falsely; and such a person
should be fined 2,500 *Paṇas*.

‘*If through anger, three times the next*;’—the ‘lowest amercement’
having been mentioned before, its ‘next’ is the ‘middling amercement.’
Or, on the basis of ordinary usage, ‘*para*’ may stand for the
‘highest.’

‘*Through ignorance*’;—he who, through mistake, should say what is
contrary to busts, on the spur of the moment,—and not during his regular
examination,—his punishment shall consist of ‘*two hundred*.’ This is
meant to be merely suggestive of some sort of punishment to be
inflicted; and hence it is not contrary (to what has been declared
regarding the *lowest fine* to consist of 250).

‘*Childishness*’— is *childish character*. The man who has not acquired
steadiness of mind is called ‘childish.’ The punishment here laid down
is for one who has just passed his minority; one who is still a minor
cannot be a witness at all.—(121)
