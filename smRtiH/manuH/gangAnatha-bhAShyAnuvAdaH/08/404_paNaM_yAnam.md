At a river-crossing, a ‘*cart*’—a conveyance, in the form of a chariot
and other things,—should pay one ‘*paṇa*.’ This is the king’s tax to be
paid by all carts that come in loaded with commodities and go out again
after having delivered these commodities, for bringing in another
supply.

‘*One man’s burden*’—when one man’s load of commodities is brought in,
the duty payable is *half-paṇa*.

‘*Animal*’— bullock, buffalo and the like;—as also a ‘*woman*’—should
pay a *quarter-paṇa*.

‘*The unloaded man*,’— who is carrying no load, should be made to pay
half of the *quarter-paṇa*. A small toll is levied from the unburdened
man, since he can cross the river by himself, and hence the help
accorded to him is comparatively small. While a woman, who is unable to
cross by herself, is made to pay more.

‘*On a ferry-crossing*’— for the purposes of crossing.—(404)
