Construe ‘*dharmeṇa*,’ ‘*in fairness*’ with ‘*pṛṣṭāḥ*,’ ‘*questioned*.’

‘*Sīmāsandhi*’ is to be construed as an appositional compound—that
‘*sandhi*,’ ‘line,’ which is the ‘*sīmā*,’ ‘boundary.’—The ‘line’
representing the point where two villages meet, and this being what is
meant by ‘boundary.’

‘*Mark*’—indicative.—(261)
