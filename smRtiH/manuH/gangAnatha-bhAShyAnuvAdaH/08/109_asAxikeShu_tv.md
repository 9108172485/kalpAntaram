‘*Witnessless cases*,’—those cases in which there are no witnesses;—in
regard to these, when the king fails to find out the truth,—*by any
means*,—*i.e*, by any ordinary methods,—‘*he shall discover*’—learn—it
‘*by means of oath*’—*i.e*, by transcendental methods of inference. The
root ‘*labh*’ ‘to get at’ (in ‘*lambhayet*’), though literally meaning
the *attaining* of a thing, indirectly implies *knowing*.

All that the advice conveyed by the injunction means is that ‘in cases
where there are no witnesses, he shall discover the truth by means of
oath’; all the rest merely fills up the metre.

‘*Mithaḥ*’—between themselves.—(109)
