In a case where, in connection with such things as cattle, gold, lands
and so forth, one man is found to have ‘possession,’—while the ‘title,’
arising from inheritance, gift and other sources, indicates the
ownership of another man,—it is ‘title’ that is to be regarded as more
authoritative; and mere possession is no proof of ownership.

‘*Such is the settled rate*’;—the eternal rule is that mere possession
does not create ownership; what sort of possession does create ownership
has been explained before, under verse 147; and the seeming
incompatibility of the present verse with that has also been explained
under that same verse.—(200)
