‘*Sanctified*’—those for whom the initiatory rite has been performed.
Though this is already implied by the term ‘*twice-born*’ itself, yet
the additional qualification has been added in order to guard against
this latter word being taken in the sense of all the three castes
promiscuously. The sense of the text is that if a Brāhmaṇa makes fellow
caste-men perform such ‘servile work’ as the washing of feet, the
removing of offal, sweeping and so forth,—‘*against their
will*’;—because he is their master,—*i.e*., possessed of the rights of
the master over them,—‘*he should be fined six hundred*,’— if he does it
‘*through greed*.’ If he does it through hatred and such other motives,
the fine shall be heavier.

The form ‘*prābhavatya*’ is an abstract noun formed from the present
participial term ‘*prabhavan*.’ And since the text speaks of
‘*mastery*,’ which implies the idea of master and servant, there would
be nothing wrong in the preceptor’s menial work being done by the pupil.

‘*Against their will*’—this shows that if they are willing, the fine
shall be very small.—(412)
