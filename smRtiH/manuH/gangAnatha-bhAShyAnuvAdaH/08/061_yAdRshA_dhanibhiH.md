The verse introduces the section dealing with witnesses.

‘*What sort of persons*’—*i.e*., of what, castes and with what
qualifications.

‘*Wealthy men*’—creditors.

^(‘)*Suits*’—dealing with money-transactions.

I shall describe now what sorts of witnesses shall he adduced; and also
how the truth should be told by them, when questioned,—this also I shall
explain.—(61)
