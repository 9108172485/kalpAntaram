+++
In a suit where a decision should have been taken on the strength of
lying witnesses,—that decision shall be reversed.

‘*What is done shall be undone i.e*., even though the creditor may have
received the amount of debt claimed, he should be made to refund it; and
the debtor shall be excused the fine that may have been imposed upon
him. In a case where the victory was merely verbal, the verdict being
simply ‘you are defeated,’—the same shall be declared to be reversed.

The decision, carried into effect, even to the realisation of the
fine,—is what is said to be ‘*done*’; and this ‘*shall cease*’, ‘*become
undone*’; the repetition of the same idea serving the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(117)
