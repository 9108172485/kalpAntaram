In cases where ‘death’ has been laid down for the *Kṣatriya* and other
castes, it is to be ‘tonsure’ for the Brāhmaṇa. For instance, for
adultery, the non-Brāhmaṇa deserves the death-penalty,—the general rule
being that ‘the male shall be flayed.’

The term ‘*prāṇāntaka*’ is to be explained as *prāṇānām antam gacchati*
or ‘*prāṇānāmant?m karoti*,’—*that which brings about the end of life*;
the form being formed with the ‘*ṇvul*’ affix.

Others read ‘*prāṇāntika*’;—in which case the affix is ‘*ṭhañ*,’—the
meaning being ‘relating to death.’

‘*For the other castes*’—the *Kṣatriya* and others, except the
*Brāhmaṇa*,—‘*it is to be actual death*.’

*Putting to death* having already been prescribed before, the present
text has been taken as serving the purpose of putting forward the
injunction of tonsure and the fine of one thousand, as supplementary to
the former injunction. Otherwise, in as much as the death penalty has
not been prescribed for the *Brāhmaṇa*, what would be the occasion for
declaring that ‘Tonsure is the death-penalty for the Brāhmaṇa?’

It might be argued that the possibility of death-penalty for the
Brāhmaṇa is indicated by the general law that ‘the man should be
flayed.’”

But in that case the substitute should have been put forward in that
same connection; so that the connection of the two could be clearly
perceived.—(379).
