‘*No evil of any kind*’—*i.e*., no sin, no punishment, no expiatory
rites.

‘*Openly*’—in the presence of other people;—‘*secretly*’ by
administering poison, etc.;—*i.e*., by whatever means.

‘*Fury*’—the deity of anger—‘*recoils upon Fury*’;—so that there is no
relation of ‘slayer’ and ‘slain’ between the two *persons*; since it is
the desperado’s *anger* that is killed by the *anger* of the other
person.

‘This is purely declamatory; being analogous to the following speech of
the person who is seeking for gifts and says—‘Who will give to me? I am
not the *receiver*, nor you the *giver*; so that there would be nothing
wrong in the acceptance of the gift.’

In connection with the desperado mentioned in this text, the author has
not laid down any penalties that should be indicted upon him for
committing an act of violence. That has got to be found in the section
on ‘Hurt’; it is something over and above it that has been laid down
here, in view of his being the ‘worst offender’; as said above
(345).—(351)
