‘*Seeking to recover it*’—*i.e*., filing a suit before the King, with a
view to recover it in the manner of a debt;—when, on being asked to pay
back what he has already received, the man files an application before
the King, saying ‘Having given the money to me he seeks to take it away
from me’; the ‘recovering’ of the gift consisting, in this case, of its
being *confirmed*.—This is done cither ‘*through arrogance or
greed*’;—this describes the causes of the action mentioned before.

The penalty for the man who does this act shall be ‘*one
gold-piece*’;—‘*as an expiation for that theft*’;—lest people think that
the man, being regarded as a thief, should suffer the penalties
prescribed for theft, the author has laid down the penalty as ‘*one gold
piece*.’ And yet he has used the word ‘*theft*’ with a view to preclude
the notion that the man is not a ‘thief,’ since what he has taken was
given to him and he did not take it away himself. The meaning thus is
that, though the man is a ‘thief,’ yet his punishment, as here laid
down, shall consist of ‘one gold piece’ only, but in all other respects,
he is to be treated as a ‘thief.’—(213)
