title = "276 ब्राह्मण-क्षत्रियाभ्यान् तु"

+++
The construction of this passage is elliptical:—‘In the case of mutual
abuse between the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya, this shall be the
punishment.’

Or, the Dative (in ‘*brāhmāṇakṣatriyābhyāṃ*’) may be taken as denoting
*purpose*; the sense being—‘for the purpose of keeping in check the
Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya.’

The punishment here prescribed is to be inflicted when some grievous
offence is attributed, and causes pain—(276)
