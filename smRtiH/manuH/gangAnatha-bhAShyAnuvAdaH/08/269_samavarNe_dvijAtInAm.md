If a once-born person insults a twice-born one with gross abuse, he
should suffer the cutting off of his tongue; as he is of low
origin.—(270)

‘*Once-born person*’—the *Śūdra*; if he ‘*insults*’—abuses—the higher
castes—‘*with gross abuse*’—harsh words attributing heinous
offences,—suffers ‘*the cutting off of the tongue*.’
