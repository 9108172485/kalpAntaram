‘*Prāptāparādhāḥ*,’—those who have fallen upon, committed, a fault.
‘*Fault*’ means *transgression of morality*; when any such has been
committed by them, they should he beaten.

As a matter of fact, beating is a form of *hurt*, and as such is
forbidden by the general law—‘no living beings shall be injured’; but an
exception to this is made in the case of transgressions by the wife and
other persons.

All these are relative terms; hence the meaning is that the wife is to
be chastised by him whose wife she is, the slave is to be chastised by
him who is his master, and so forth.

What is enjoined here is the method of keeping the persons on the right
path, and not actual beating; so that chastisement may be administered
verbally; and in cases where the fault is serious, there may also be
beating.

In the place of ‘*uterine*’ we should read ‘*younger*,’ and the right
reading would thus be ‘*bhrātā tathānujaḥ*’; since it is the younger
brother that may be chastised by his elder brother, like a child. The
half-brother also is under the tutelage of the elder brother, if the
latter is a duly qualified person; hence he also, if he takes to the
wrong path, should be prevented by all the methods, ending with
*beating*,

‘*Split bamboo*’—the bark of the bamboo. This has been mentioned only as
illustrative of the lotus-fibre and other such objects which cause only
slight pain.—(299)
