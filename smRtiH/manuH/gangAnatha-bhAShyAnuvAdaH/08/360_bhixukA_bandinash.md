‘*Mendicants*,’— those living on alms; these may talk to women, in the
act of begging, if they are not ‘*checked*’ by their husbands.

Or, the meaning may be that they shall not be checked or forbidden in
this.

‘*Bards*,’—those who sing the praises of kings.

‘*Initiated at a rite*,’—These persons would have to speak to women in
the course of the response that they have to make in acceptance of their
appointment.

‘*Craftsmen*,’—cooks and others.

These should not be prevented even at such places as the watering-place
and the like.—(360)
