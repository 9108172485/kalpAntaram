‘This servant is my own and hence I *like* him,—this other is only an
inhabitant of my kingdom, and is proceeding against the former, hence I
*dislike* him’;—all such ideas he should renounce.

In the protecting of, and dealings with, his subjects, he shall be
entirely impartial, like Yuma; the ‘*manner of Yama*’ having been found
to be strictly impartial. The form ‘*yāmyayā*’ is explained by the
exclusion of the ‘*yaṇ*’ affix mentioned in Pāṇini 6.4.148 and the
addition of the syllable ‘*ya*’ under one of the additional rules.

“Who is the person who becomes like Yama?”

He who has ‘*his anger suppressed and senses controlled*’;—*i* .*e*.,
one should renounce all attachment and thus overcome love and
hatred.—(173)
