‘*Having caught him*,’ *i.e*., detected and put him under restraint—tho
king should punish him, without giving him any time.

*The* ‘*niṣka of four suvarṇas each*’—is that which is made up of four
‘*suvarṇas*.’

Though under 8.317, the ‘*niṣka*’ has been defined as a measure
consisting of four ‘suvarṇas,’ yet the qualification is added here in
view of other definitions of the ‘*niṣka*’ found in other Smṛtis—*e.g*.,
one of them describes it as consisting of ‘a hundred *suvarṇas*.’

It might be argued that, in as much as the author himself has applied
the name ‘*niṣka*’ to four ‘*suvarṇas*’ only, the mere mention of the
name in the present text would be enough to show what is meant.

But, since the work is a metrical treatise, the presence of a
superfluous epithet cannot be regarded as a defect.

Others have taken the term ‘*catuḥsuvarṇa*’ as a Bahuvrīhi compound,
having the collective force, and hence explained the verse as
prescribing *three fines*; the meaning being that the fine is to consist
of ‘*four suvarṇas*,’ and ‘*six niṣkas*’; so that *ten niṣkas* come to
be indicated.

But for the purpose of making the compound a *Bahuvrīhi*, it would be
necessary to fasten the sense of *possession* on to that of
*association*. For mere *association* with ‘variegated cows’ does not
make Devadatta a ‘*Citraguḥ*’ (which is a Bahuvrīhi compound meaning
*possessing variegated cows*).

If the fines are to be taken as *three* distinct ones, then the only
construction possible is to take the three as constituting a single
penalty.

The penalty hero prescribed is alternative to ‘banishment’ (prescribed
in the preceding verse).—(220)
