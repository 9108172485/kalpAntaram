If the ‘*complainant*’—plaintiff—having gone to the King, and on getting
the other party summoned,—does not state his case, then, on account of
haring done all this needlessly, ‘*he shall be imprisoned and fined*’;
whether the punishment shall be imprisonment or fine, and what shall be
the exact period and amount of these, should he determined in accordance
with the nature of the case and the loss entailed upon the other party
on account of being summoned. For this reason it is necessary for the
complainant to state his case on the same day.

As for the defendant, ‘*if he does not answer within three
fortnights*,’—then he shall not be either imprisoned or fined; in fact,
if he does not answer the charge within the time, he loses the case.

‘*According to law*’;—such defeat would be quite legal, and not illegal.

‘*Within three fortnights*’;............ (?)

The real meaning of this verse has been explained by us above (under
verse 56).—(58)
