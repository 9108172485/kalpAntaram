‘*Unfair punishment*’ is that punishment, that savours strongly of
injustice;—*i.e*., one that takes no account of what has been just said,
and which is determined cither entirely on the basis of the letter of
the law, or by the king’s whim, or by love, hatred and such other
feelings.

Such a punishment is ‘*destructive of reputation*,’ also ‘*subversive of
fame*’; ‘reputation’ consists in the man’s good qualities being known in
his own country, while ‘fame’ in their being known in foreign countries.
Or ‘reputation’ may consist in one’s good name during life.—Or the
passage being a purely commendatory one, some other distinction may be
drawn.

‘*Leads to loss of heaven*’;—*i.e*., obstructs the passage to heaven,
that might have been opened by other meritorious deeds.

‘*In the other world*’;—this has been added for filling up the metre;
‘heaven’ itself being the other world.—(127)
