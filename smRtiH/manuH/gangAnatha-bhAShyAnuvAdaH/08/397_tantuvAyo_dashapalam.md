The ‘*weaver*’ is one who weaves yarns, and makes clot? (cloth?) for
garments, etc.

When he has received ‘*ten palas*’ of yarn, he should return a piece of
cloth weighing one more ‘*pala*.’ He should make his repayments at this
rate of interest. Special considerations may be made in regard to the
coarseness or fineness of the texture of the cloth, or to the fact of
its being wooly and so forth.

Otherwise there shall be a fine of twelve ‘*paṇas*.’

This punishment is to be inflicted in the case of non-payment of the
*interest*. In the case of non-payment of the *principal*, he would have
to pay according to the rule laid down by the guild.

Thus in the case of the principal consisting of ‘*twenty palas*’ of
yarn, if the man does not pay the interest, his fine shall he double;
and so on, the fine being computed triple, quadruple and so forth.

Others hold that the fine is to be paid to the king.—(397)
