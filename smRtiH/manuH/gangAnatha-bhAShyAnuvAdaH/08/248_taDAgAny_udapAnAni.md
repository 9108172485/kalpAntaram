‘*Tanks*’—large reservoirs of water.

‘*Ponds*’—pools.

‘*Water-reservoir*’—wells and the like.

‘*Fountains*’— plots of ground from which small quantities of water
trickle out.

‘*Temples*’—houses for the worshipping of *Yakṣas* and other demi-gods.

All these are such marks as are publicly visible; and cannot be easily
obliterated; specially as the destroying of these entails a great sin;
and further, since all men desiring to fetch water, and to visit the
deity in the temple, are constantly on the spot, the boundary-line
becomes well known to witnesses.—(248)
