This verse forms the basis for all penalties and offences, described
above; and it is in accordance with this that all punishment is to be
determined.

‘*Motive*,’ ‘*anubandha*,’ literally means *repealed action* or *that
which leads to repeated action*; the meaning thus is that the king shall
ascertain what it was that led the man to commit the offence, *i.e*., he
shall find out if he was urged to it by the starving condition of his
family, or by association with criminals, or by reason of his being
addicted to drink and gambling,—and if he did it intentionally or by
mistake,—if he was urged to it by another person, or he did it
voluntarily. These are the points to be considered in the ascertaining
of the man’s ‘*motive*.’

‘*Place*,’—a village, forest, granary or pasture-ground.

‘*Time*’—whether it was night or day; whether it was a time of scarcity
or of plenty; whether the criminal is a youth or a full-grown person.

‘*Condition*,’—capability or otherwise to suffer the penalty,—whether he
is rich or poor.

^(‘)*Offence*’—under which of the eighteen categories the act falls.

Having, in due order, considered all this, the king shall ‘*inflict the
punishment*,’—so that the condition of the society may not suffer.—(126)
