The ‘*thicket*’ and other things have been mentioned only by way of
illustration; and not for the purpose of excluding other things; since
such trees as the *Khadira*, the *Sāra*, the *Kālāñjana* and so
forth,—as also things similar to the ‘*pebble*’—are also used.

The text adds what is meant by ‘*such-like*’—‘*which* *the earth may not
eat up in time*.’ ‘*Eating-up*’ is used figuratively, for *corroding*.
Just as what has been *eaten up* cannot be differentiated from other
things, so also what has become obliterated by the corrosion of the
earth.—(251)
