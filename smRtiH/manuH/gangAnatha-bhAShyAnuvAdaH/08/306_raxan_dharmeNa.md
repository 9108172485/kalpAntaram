‘*Creatures*’—movable as well as immovable beings.

‘*Protects*’—these from thieves.

‘*Striking those who deserve to be struck*’—who are liable, under law,
to the penalty of death.

Such a king daily acquires the merit of performing such sacrifices ‘*at
which hundreds of thousands are given away*’—*e.g*., the *Pauṇḍarīka*
and the rest. This has been added by way of praise of the act—(306)
