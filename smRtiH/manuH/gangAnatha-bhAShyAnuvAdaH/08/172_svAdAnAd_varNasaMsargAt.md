‘*Svādānam*’;—the ‘*ādā* *na*,’ ‘taking’ of his ‘*sva*,’ ‘what is his
due.’ Or it may be explained as ‘*su*’—‘good’—‘*ādāna*’—‘receiving’;
‘good’ here standing for what is proper.

‘*Adjustment of castes*,’—*i.e*., the admixture of the persons of two
castes with members of the same caste; we take it as ‘*two*,’ because an
‘admixture’ presupposes *two* relatives; and as no other relatives are
mentioned we take the ‘adjustment’ or ‘admixture’ as pertaining to
*castes*. The mixture that takes place among the subdivisions of various
castes cannot be called an ‘adjustment of the castes.’ because it does
not pertain to the ‘castes’ pure and simple.

*Ṛju* however reads a negative particle here; in which case this would
be a reiteration of the prohibition of the ‘crossing’ of castes.

Also on account of ‘*protecting the weak*’ from the ‘strong,’ when they
are suffering at the hands of these latter,—‘*the power of the king
grown*.’

The sense of all this is that.—‘The King should investigate the cases
properly, and should never inflict illegal penalties’;—and it is as a
hortatory supplement to this injunction that we are going to have a
number of passages.—(172)
