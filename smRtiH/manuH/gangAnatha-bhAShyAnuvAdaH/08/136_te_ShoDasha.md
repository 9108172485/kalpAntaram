Sixteen ‘*Silver-Beans*’ make a ‘*Silver-Dharaṇa*’; of which the other
name is ‘*Purāṇa*.’

‘*Kārṣāpaṇa*’ and ‘*Paṇa*’ are the two names of the ‘Copper-karṣa’; the
term ‘*Karṣa*’ is used here in the sense in which it is used among the
people, and it is not used in any technical sense, in the way in which
‘*Kṛṣṇala*’ and other terms have been used.—(136)
