When the man deposes falsely after receiving a bribe from another
person, his motive is *greed*.

‘*Through embarrassment*.’—Though the man may be quite truthful,
habituated to speak in strict accordance with what he has actually seen,
yet on account of some distraction of the mind, at the time of his
examination, he may be so confused as to be unable either to comprehend
the question or to recall the exact facts of the case, and thereby he
may make statements that are not true; in this case the reason is
‘*embarrassment*.’

‘*Fright*’ is *fear*, in the form of the suspicion—‘if this man was to
lose the case through my telling the truth, he would ruin me by injuring
my relations, or by making me suffer financially.’

‘*One thousand*;’—what is that to which this number appertains is to be
learnt from other passages: they are ‘*paṇas*.’

‘*Lowest amercement’—i.e*. 250 *paṇas*, as described under 138 below.

‘*Two middling ones’—i.e*., amercements; the number being changed into
the dual.

‘*Four times the first,’—i.e*. 1,000 *paṇas*.

It is through metrical considerations that the same idea is expressed in
various ways.—(120)
