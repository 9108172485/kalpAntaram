The term ‘*vetanādānakarmaṇaḥ*’ ‘*the action of nonpayment of wages*,’
only names the particular *Head of Dispute*; hence there is no room for
any such objection as the following—“How is it that the text speaks of
having dealt with the *action of non-payment of wages*,—when the
*action* of *payment* also has been dealt with?”—Because there is
nothing wrong in the *naming* of a subject in accordance with anything
that may he related to it; and every little detail does not necessarily
enter into its name, for instance, in the *Agni-hotra-rites*, even
though libations are actually offered to both *Agni and Prajāpati*, it
is called ‘*Agnihotra*,’ ‘offering to Agni’; and similarly in the case
of all such names as ‘*Sthūṇā*,’ ‘*Darśa*’ *and so forth*?

‘*Contract*’ is *agreement*, the stipulation or promise, in the form—‘I
shall certainly do such and such a thing, exactly in the manner in which
you wish.’ The ‘*breakers*’ of this are those who go against it.

What is referred to here is what has been mentioned above (under the
Heads of Dispute) as ‘Breach of Contract?’

The first half of the verse sums up the foregoing section and the latter
introduces the next.—(218)
