The question ending as to who are the gods that see the sin committed
secretly and in private, the text puts forward present verse.

The term ‘*heart*’ stands for the subtle spirit located in the heart.
The Heaven and the rest are spoken of as ‘seers’ figuratively;—though
they are insentient, they are represented as sentient. According to
other philosophical systems, all the great elemental substances are
portions of gods, and as such actually sentient; *e.g*., it is described
that the earth went to Brahmā, in order to seek for help in relieving
her of the burden of sinners.

The gods being all-pervading, there is nothing unknown to them; hence
they know the conduct and character, as also the good and bad points in
the body of the soul.—(86)
