‘*Abusing*’ is speaking harshly. In most cases it takes the following
forms:—(*a*) Causing pain by addressing foul words;—(*b*) cursing
without reason—‘O low-born one, may you suffer long’;—(*c*) giving false
information; *e.g*., ‘your unmarried daughter is pregnant’;—(*d*)
defamation, attributing to him serious or non-serious offences.

The punishment to be inflicted upon the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya for
abusing a Brāhmaṇa is as here laid down. In another *Smṛti*
(Yājñavalkya, 2.2.10) however we read—‘If a defamation refers to a
heinous offence, the penalty shall consist of the middle amercement;
while if it refer to a minor offence, it shall be the lowest
amercement.’

For the *Śūdra* ‘*immolation*,’—in the form of beating, cutting off the
tongue, actual death, and so forth, to be adjusted in accordance, with
the exact nature of the abuse.—(267)
