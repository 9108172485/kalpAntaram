This verse sums up the section.

‘*What is given as friendly loan*’—*i.e*., what is given, through
friendship, for being used for some time.

The cases have to be decided in such a way as noṭ to cause injury to the
keeper of the pledge or deposit. ‘*Akṣiṇvan*’—without causing injury to.

In the whole of this section on ‘deposits’ only two or three verses are
mandatory in their character, all the rest is purely
commendatory,—mentioning things already known, in a friendly
spirit.—(196)
