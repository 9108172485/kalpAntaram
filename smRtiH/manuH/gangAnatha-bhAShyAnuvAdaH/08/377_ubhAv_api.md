‘*Both these*,’ *i.e*., the *Vaiśya* and the *Kṣatriya*—‘*offending
against*’—*i.e*., having sexual intercourse with—a protected Brāhmaṇa
woman—‘*should he punished like the Śūdra*,’—*i.e*. ‘deprived of
everything, if the woman is protected’ (as declared in 374).

‘*Or he should be burnt in a fire of dry grass*’—the term ‘or’ is meant
to indicate option in the *method of killing*, and not in regard to the
*killing* itself. Because in the case of the protected Brāhmaṇa woman,
there is no other penalty for the *Śūdra* except death—(377)
