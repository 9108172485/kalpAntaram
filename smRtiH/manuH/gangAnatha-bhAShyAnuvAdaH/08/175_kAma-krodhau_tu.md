Just as ‘*Rivers*’— streams—take refuge with the ocean and having taken
refuge, become attached to it, and continue to remain merged in it, and
never turn back,—similarly the subjects turn towards the king, when he
subdues love and hatred, and coming to have their interests common with
the king, become merged into him.—(175)
