If the surety is one who is ‘*Nirādiṣṭadhanaḥ*,’ a person to whom money
has been handed over by the debtor, with the instruction—‘In the event
of my being unable to pay, you will please clear oil the debt with
this,’—and hence ‘*alandhanaḥ*,’ having ‘*enough money*’;—*i.e*., who
had made over to him money sufficient to pay off the whole amount due to
the creditor-then he should be made to pay. But if the amount made ever
to him was small, while the amount of the debt is large, then he should
not be made to pay.

This verse supplies the answer to the question in the preceding verse.

Though the money had been made over to the surety, yet it is the son who
is to be made to pay out as of his own property (the surety having
died). Hence the words should be construed to mean ‘the son of the
surety to whom money had been made over’; as it is the *son* that forms
the subject-matter of the context; as for the surety himself, his
liability would follow from the mere fact of his being a ‘surety.’

‘*Such is the settled rule*,’—ordinance deduced from the scriptures.

What is intended having been already expressed by the term
‘*alandhanaḥ*,’ ‘who had *enough money*,’— the addition of the term
‘*nirādiṣṭadhanaḥ*,’ ‘*to whom money had been made over*,’ is due to the
fact of the treatise being a metrical one (which admits of superfluous
words and expressions).—(162)
