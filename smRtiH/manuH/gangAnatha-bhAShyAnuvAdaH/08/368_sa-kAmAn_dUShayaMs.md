Inasmuch as the foregoing verse also pertains to the case of a willing
maiden, the penalty therein laid down applies to the case where the man
defiles her through sheer audacity; while in a case where he does it by
stealth, secretly like a thief, the punishment shall consist of the fine
of two hundred, without the amputation of the fingers.

Or, the text may refer to the following case—

If the maiden happens to be in lore with a certain man, and having had
intercourse with him has lost her virginity,—then since the girl was
willing, the man, for the crime of defiling her, shall suffer the
penalty here laid down.

Or, the ‘*defiling*’ meant here may be taken as the *touching of the
hand* and some such part of the body; the man’s motive being—‘if people
see me touching her hand, they will think that she loves me and then no
one else will seek for her baud, and she shall be mine.’—(368)
