If thieves, known or unknown, should bore a hole through the wall and
take away the artiole,—in spite of the depositary having taken all due
care for its protection,—then the loss falls upon the owner (depositor).

‘*Carried away by water*’—*i.e*., moved away from its place of keeping,
to some other place.—(189)
