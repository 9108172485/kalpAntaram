This verse sums up the preceding section and introduces the next.

Under 8.6, this head of dispute has been mentioned as ‘assault—corporal
and verbal’ (Hurt and Defamation) \[‘Hurt’ coming first\], in the
present context, the latter has been taken up first. This alteration of
the order of sequence is due to considerations of simplicity: In most
oases actual *physical* assault is preceded by *verbal* assault.
Further, a copulative compound (as ‘*daṇḍavācike*’ of verse 6) denotes
only mutual relationship, it lays no stress upon the order in which the
terms occur. So that both kinds of ‘assault ’—*physical* as well as
*verbal*—being equally meant, what sort of ‘alteration of order of
sequence’ is there in the present case? This has been folly explained by
the author of the *Mahābhāṣya* on Pāṇini, 1.8.10; and it is on the basis
of this theory that the two assaults have been mentioned by means of a
compound.—(206)
