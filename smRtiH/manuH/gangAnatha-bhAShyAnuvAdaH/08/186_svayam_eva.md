It has been just declared that while the depositor is still alive, the
deposit shall not be handed over to his ‘next-of-kin.’ But when he is
dead, if the depositary should himself restore the property to his heir,
who does not know that it belongs to him, then he shall not be made to
undergo the trouble of a law-suit and all that follows in its wake.

If there be a suspicion that there may he something more with the
man,—on the ground that the deceased was a wealthy man and he did not
keep his property with any other person,—then other kinds of evidence
shall be considered, but the man shall not be harassed with oaths or
ordeals with poison, etc.; though there would he nothing wrong in the
employment of such test as the ‘*ghaṭakośa*,’ the ‘*satyataṇḍula*’ and
so forth (which are not so humiliating).

The condition of ‘*the absence of witnesses*’ (mentioned in 182-183)
should be taken as applicable here also.—(186)
