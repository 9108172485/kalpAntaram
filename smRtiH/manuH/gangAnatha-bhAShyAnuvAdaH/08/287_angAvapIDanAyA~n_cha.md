‘*Injury to limbs*’—in the shape of the breaking of joints and the like,
caused by the stroke of tough ropes and the like.

In such cases the man hurt should receive from the assailant the charges
in connection with the physician and the medication incurred in
obtaining recovery.

A similar construction is to be placed upon the compound word
‘*prāṇa-śoṇitayoḥ*,’ ‘*of strength and blood*.’

Or in the case of the latter, the construction may be—‘*prāṇaśoṇitayoḥ
samutthānavyayam dāpyaḥ*,’ ‘he should be made to pay the expenses for
the recovery of strength and blood,’ *i.e*., ‘when these two have
suffered’; this being understood.

‘*Prāṇa*’ means *strength*; when a man becomes ill in consequence of the
hurt received, he has to go without food, and hence becomes emaciated
and loses his strength.

In a case where no limb has been seriously injured, the assailant should
be made to supply just that quantity of butter and oil and such things
as may be needed for the recovery of strength.

Similarly when blood has been fetched, and, as a consequence the man
becomes weak, or contracts some disease,—the assailant shall be made to
pay the expenses incurred in obtaining a complete cure.

If the man hurt does not accept all this, then the whole amount is to be
totalled up and paid to the king as ‘fine.’—(287)
