‘*He shall take, etc*.’ (the second half of the verse) represents the
injunction; and what is said regarding its being ‘*sanctioned by*
*Vasiṣṭha*’ is merely commendatory;—the sense being that ‘Vasiṣṭha, the
revered sage, cognisant of all that happens at the three points of time
and devoid of greed, accepted interest, hence it is commendable.’ ‘By
its means one’s capital increases, and yet there is no impropriety in it
on the ground of its being indicative of greed.

‘*Stipulate*,’—Employ; at the time that he is advancing money to the
debtor, he should clearly stipulate the rate of interest.

In the case of all things that can be counted or measured,—such as
clothes, grains, gold and so forth- the rate of interest is to be as
here laid down. In the case of liquor, however, the rate of interest has
been declared to be eight times of the principal,—and this is an
exception to the limit that the total amount of the debt shall not
exceed the double of the principal, as we shall explain later on.—(140)
