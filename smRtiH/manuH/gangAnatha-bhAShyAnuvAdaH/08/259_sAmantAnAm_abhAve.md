‘*Original inhabitants*’—The epithet has been added with a view to
indicate their importance. Those persons who were living in the village
at the time of its foundation, and who are co-eval with it, are called
‘original’; such inhabitants of the neighbouring villages remain on the
spot constantly. There would be ‘absence’ of these, on account of their
having become dispersed, for some reason or the other.

What is the remedy, if these are not available?

In that case the king shall question ‘*these*’—the persons going to be
mentioned in the next verse.

Or, ‘*maulāḥ*’ may be taken to mean ‘experienced.’—‘*Sāmantāḥ*’ as
explained above. And the meaning may he—‘In the absence of experienced
people, ordinary neighbours may he regarded as reliable authority, and
in the absence of these latter, the frequenters of forests should he
carefully examined.’—(259)
