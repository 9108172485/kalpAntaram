‘*Not having brought forward*’—paid up—‘*the gold*,’—*i.e*., the amount
of gold due as interest,—‘*he should renew the bond*’;—*i.e*., in the
presence of witnesses he should make the declaration—‘I owe this man so
much principal and so much interest,’—and should put this down in
writing also; entering the amount of interest for one year;—so explain
some people.

And in the new bond, when the principal along with accrued interest has
been entered as the principal, the rate of interest stipulated should he
very low; just such as may not become too much of a burden for the man;
that is, it should be lower than the former rate.

Yajvan, Asahāya and Nārada hold that at the time of the renewal of the
bond the debtor should be made to pay even a shell, if he is able to do
so; so that the witnesses may not be witnesses to a mere verbal
statement, but to the actual payment of even a small amount as interest;
so that they actually see the money-transaction; and when they come to
be examined,—which may be any time during ten years,—they may have their
mind firm, on account of being able to recall what they had heard and
also actually seen with their eyes.—(155)
