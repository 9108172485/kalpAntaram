‘Those regions, in the shape of hell and the rest, which are reached by
those persons who have killed a Brāhmaṇa, shall he yours, if you tell
the untruth; therefore you should tell the truth,’—such is the
exhortation.

‘*The betrayer of friends*’—he who ruins the Brāhamaṇa and others by
depriving them of their wife and property.

‘*The ingrate*’: ho who forgets the benefits conferred upon him, and
causes injury to that same person who had conferred those on him; and
the *perjuror* suffers the same pains that befall such a person.—(89)
