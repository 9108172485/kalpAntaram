‘*Tributes*’ and the rest are the names of the various kinds of royal
dues; known by several names in several countries, just like the words
‘*sūpa*’, ‘*māṇavaka*’ and the rest. Of these ‘*tribute*’ is the sixth
part of the grain-produce;—‘*tax*’ is what is paid in cash;—‘*duties*’
are what the tradesmen pay;—‘*presents*’ are offering of fruits and the
like.

If a king takes all this, and yet does not protect the people from
thieves, he would ‘*immediately*’—having his life-span cut short—‘*sink
into hell*.’

The meaning of the verso is that—‘for fear of having his life span cut
short and sinking into hoH, the king should receive his dues and afford
protection to the people.’—(307)
