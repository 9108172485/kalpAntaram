The first half sums up the foregoing Head of Dispute, and the second
introduces the next head.

‘*The non-misappropriation of gifts has been
explained*.’—‘*Misappropriation*’ is non-fulfilment; and it is the
negation of this that is expressed by the negative prefix; the sense
being that if the gift is resumed in the manner described above, it does
not mean its improper ‘misappropriation’; such is the rule of all gifts.

‘*Lawful*’—not against law.

“When the gift, after being promised, is not paid,—how does this not
militate against law?”

Such a question should not be raised. Since the right and lawful course
in the case is that it should not be paid, or if paid, it should be
taken hack.

‘*Explained*’—described.

‘*Yathāvat*,’ ‘*fully*’—*i.e*., in the right manner. The meaning is that
‘it has been expounded in the proper manner.’ Or the term ‘*yathā*’ may
be taken to mean *propriety*, so that ‘*yathāvat*’ would mean
*properly*.

‘*Wages*’— subsistence-allowance; and the ‘*non-misappropriation*’ of
this is going to be described. That is, what I am going to describe now
is the behaviour by which there is no improper misappropriation of duty
on the part of those who work on wages.—(214)
