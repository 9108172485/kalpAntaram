In as much as the act of ‘swearing’ consists in invoking upon oneself
evil consequences,—such as ‘If I do this may such and such an evil
befall me,’—when a man is made to say ‘I swear by truth,’ what is meant
is—‘may all my merit due to truthfulness become futile.’

‘*Conveyances*’ and ‘*weapons*’ also are the means of swearing in this
same sense; when one swears by these it means—‘may these be useless for
me.’

‘*Cattle, grains and gold*,’—the Vaiśya should be made to swear by
touching these; which would mean ‘may these be useless for me.’

‘*The Śūdra by all sins*’;—the *Śūdra* should be made to say—‘may the
following sins befall me.’—(113)
