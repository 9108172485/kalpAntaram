The term ‘*sthāna*’ ‘*place*,’ is synonymous with ‘subject’; the meaning
being that the man should be made to suffer pain on these spots.

In as much as for the Brāhmaṇa also pecuniary punishment has been
directly prescribed, it follows that what is said here in regard to his
departing ‘unscathed’ is with reference to corporal punishment, which is
forbidden in his case; even though ‘property’ also is included (in the
next verse) among the ‘ten places.’

Our opinion however is that, in as much as one can be called
‘*unscathed*’ only when he has all his property also intact, *pecuniary*
punishment also must be taken as forbidden in the case of the Brāhmaṇa;
hence if a Brāhmaṇa, endowed with learning, character and noble birth,
should, by chance, happen to commit a crime, there is no pecuniary
punishment either. In fact, it is in reference to such a Brāhmaṇa that
Gautama, having begun with the statement—‘In this world there are two
men firm in their vow,’ (8.1)—goes on to say,—‘He should be excused from
six.’ (8.13).—(124)
