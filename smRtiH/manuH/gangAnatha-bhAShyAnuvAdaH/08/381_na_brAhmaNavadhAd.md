title = "381 न ब्राह्मणवधाद्"

This is a declamatory supplement to what has gone before; Than the
slaying of the Brāhmaṇa, there is no ‘*greater crime*,’—sin leading to
greater suffering.

The Ablative in ‘*vadhāt*’ is to be explained by supplying the term
‘*aṅgaḥ*.’

For this reason, the king should not even think of inflictin g either
death or amputation on the *Brāhmaṇa*.—(381)
