The mother does not deserve to be forsaken,—should net be cast off.
‘Forsaking’ consists in turning her out of the house, if she has failed
in her maternal duties; *i.e*., if she fails to do what she ought to do
in return for what she receives at the bands of her son.

The same explanation applies to the case of the father and the rest
also.

The term ‘*strī*’ (woman) stands for the *wife*, as is clear from the
fact that the text mentions only relatives.

These should not be forsaken, unless they are outcasts. As regards the
mother, Śātātapa has declared that ‘to the son the mother never becomes
an outcast.’

The ‘forsaking’ of the outcast, wife consists in giving up all
intercourse with her and in forbidding her to do household work; but the
giving of food and clothing is not forbidden; as it is declared
that—‘food and clothing should be given to even outcast wives, and these
should live near the house.’—(389)
