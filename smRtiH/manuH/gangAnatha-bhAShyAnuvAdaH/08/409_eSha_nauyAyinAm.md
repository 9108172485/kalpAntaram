‘*Boat-passengers*’—persons habituated to going about a boats.

It is with regard to these that this law has been laid down, that ‘if
anything should be damaged by the fault of the boatmen, it shall be made
good by them.’

‘*In the case of accidents due to heaven*’—*i.e*., when the boat breaks
as the result of an accident due to storm or such causes, and
commodities happen to be damaged,—no punishment is to be inflicted upon
the boatmen.

This same law applies to the carriers of goods on land also. If the
carrier walks along with due care, supporting himself by a staff, and
has duly tied up the bundles, if he happens to tumble down on the road
which has suddenly been rendered slippery by rain, and the goods he is
carrying become damaged in consequence,—whose fault could it be held to
be?—(409)
