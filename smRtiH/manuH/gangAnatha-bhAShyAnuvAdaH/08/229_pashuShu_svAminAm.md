In regard to ‘*cattle*’— such as cows and the like—there may be some
‘*transgressions*’; and from those may arise ‘*disputes between their
owners and keepers*’;—the owner saying—‘you have destroyed my cow, give
her to me’;—on which the keeper retorts—‘There was no neglect on my
part.’ The ‘*true law*’—the established rule—that governs such
disputes—that ‘*I am going to describe fully*.’

This summing up of the sense of the entire section is put forth for the
purpose of securing the attention of the audience.—(229)
