The term ‘*amercement*’ is to be construed also with the terms
‘*middling*’ and ‘*highest*’; though in other treatises these two terms
are found to be used by themselves also:—*e.g*., the punishment with
these is the ‘*Highest*.’ From the point of view of the scriptures, and
also from the juxtaposition of the words, they are to be regarded as
qualifying ‘*amercement*.’

The words of the text are quite clear.—(138)
