This verse serves to make clear what has been said before. If the
creditor recovers his money from the debtor by means of ‘trick’ and the
other methods, the King shall not tell him anything, such as—‘why did
you, without informing me, take from him by trick or fraud, his
ornament, etc., for the purpose of recovering your debt? Why do you not
return it to him?’—(60)
