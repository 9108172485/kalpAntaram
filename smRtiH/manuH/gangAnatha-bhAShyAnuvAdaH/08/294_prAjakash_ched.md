**(verses 8.293-294)  
**

‘*Driver*’—the man who drives the cart; his ‘*ineptitude*’ consists in
his being not trained. What is said here applies to the case where the
accident is due to this, and not to want of care; for when the driver is
a trained one, the punishment should fall on him, there being no fault
on the part of the master.

On account of the said ‘*ineptitude*,’ if the cart suddenly happens to
‘*turn off,’—i.e*., giving up the right path, swerves off either
sideways or backwards,—and should thereby cause some damage, the owner
should he fined for having employed an untrained driver.

In view of what is going to be said regarding the case ‘when a man is
killed’ (296), where diverse penalties are prescribed in accordance with
the nature of the living being injured or article damaged,—significance
cannot be attached to what is said in the present verse regarding the
fine being ‘two hundred’; all that is meant by the declaration is that
the case cited is one calling for punishment; specially as there is
nothing else (apart from the specific cases mentioned below) to which
the exact amount of fine here laid down may he taken as
applicable.—(293-294)
