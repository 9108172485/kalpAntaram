‘*An old man of seventy*’;—the instrumental ending in ‘*saptatyā*’ is on
the analogy of such expressions as ‘*prakṛtyā virūpuḥ*.’ The man who has
passed seventy years of age is so called.

One who ‘*attends upon*’—serves, either with personal attendance, or as
a craftsman.

These men should not be made to pay any taxes,—snoh as working for the
king for one day in the month, as laid down for craftsman under 7.
138;—by a king, even when his treasury has become depleted. This is what
is meant by the phrase ‘*by any one*’— (394)
