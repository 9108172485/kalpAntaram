‘*Sāhasa*,’ ‘*violence*’;—‘*taha*’ means ‘*force*’; and what is done *by
force* is ‘*sāhasa*,’ ‘*violence*’; whenever an improper act is done by
a man, either on the strength of his being the king’s favourite, or of
his having a large following, or of his own bodily strength, or of the
help of some powerful person,—it is called ‘*sāhasa*,’ ‘*violence*.’
*e.g*., the tearing of cloths, the burning by fire, the cutting of the
hands, and so forth.

The rest are all well known.

In such oases the character of the witnesses need not be
investigated;—this precludes the investigation that has been laid down
above, under verse 60, *et seq*.; that investigation, on the other hand,
which bears upon doubt regarding the man’s reliability, on account of
the presence of love, hatred, avarice and the like,—that must be done.
The placing of this limitation upon what is laid down in the text is
justified by the consideration that the present treatise is known to
have a visible source, in the person of a personal author; as has been
explained before.—(72)
