Some people hold that the weapons to be carried have been mentioned in
the particular order in view of the caste of the thief.

But this is not right; as in that case there would be no justification
for the term ‘or’; and further, people do not recognise this as the
expiation meant for the Brāhmaṇa thief, as we shall explain in the
section on ‘Expiation.’

It is only the *club*, and not the *pestle*, that is to be taken as
qualified by the epithet ‘*of khadira wood*’—(315)
