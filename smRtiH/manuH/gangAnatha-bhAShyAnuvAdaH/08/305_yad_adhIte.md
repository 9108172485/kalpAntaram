It has been said above that the merit ‘*of all persons*’ accrues to the
king; this same idea is elaborated in the present verse.

The reading of the Veda and the other acts are already known from other
sources as bringing merit.

‘*Worship*’—is the offering of worship to gods and to one’s superiors.

‘*Of each of thoae*’.—this should be construed with the term
‘*adhyayanādeḥ*’ ‘*padārthasya*’ (understood); since the term ‘*kriyā*’
would be feminine (and hence not construable with ‘*tasya*’).

‘*Sixth part*’;—this does not mean that ñvo parts of the fruit of the
act accrue to the doer, and the sixth to the king; because it is
understood that when the agent undertakes to do an act, he does it with
the motive of obtaining its whole fruit; nor can the merit or demerit of
an act done by one person accrue to another; as it is a settled fact
that the fruit of an act cannot accrue to any oue else except the doer
of it; hence what is meant is that the merit that accrues to the king
from his act of fulfilling his duty of protecting the people is equal in
amount to the said ‘*sixth part*’.—(305)
