It has been laid down that purchases shall be made from persons not
suspected of dishonesty; hence where the seller is capable of being
produced, the rule just quoted becomes applicable; but if the m in
having sold the property goes away,—and ‘*the source*,’—the
seller—cannot be produced by the man who bought from him the property
that is now recognised by its real owner as his own,—then the purchaser
has his character cleared by the fact that he made the purchase in the
open market,—in the presence of a large number of men; and on that
account he is let off without punishment.

But the property is restored to the rightful owner, ‘*the person who had
lost it*’ and then recognised it as his own.

The term ‘*nāṣṭikaḥ*’ means *he who has lost*, derived from the
participial noun ‘*naṣṭa*’ with the possessive affix ‘*ṭhan*’ and then
the reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*’; or it may be explained as meaning ‘he who is
seeking for his lost property.’

The sense in brief is this:—In the case of a public sale, there is to be
no punishment, but the loss of the price paid remains.—(202).
