After ten days there can be no ‘rescission of the sale.’

If the buyer does repent of the transaction and applies to the king for
its rescission, be should be fined six hundred ‘he shall *not return
it*.’—This prohibition is not put forth with a view to any
transcendental result; all that is meant is that such is the established
rule,—that after ten days the buyer should not be forced, against his
wish, to give up the article, nor should the seller he forced to take it
back. So that there is nothing wrong if the returning and taking back
are done amicably by mutual understanding.—(223)
