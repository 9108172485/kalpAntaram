What this verse does is to support, by ordinary experience, what has
gone in the preceding verse; hence there is no repetition.

‘*Ākāra*’ is that which changes, *variations*; such as *aspect* and the
rest.

‘*Aspect*’ has already been explained; the plural number is used in view
of there being numerous individual aspects.

‘*Gait*,’—this is in addition to what has gone in the preceding verse;
it means the ordinary gait of a man being tripped or otherwise altered.

‘*Speech*’—inconsistent and contradictory statements.

‘*Changes in the face*’—the mouth being parched and so forth.

The rest has all been explained under the previous verse.

By means of the variations of all these the innermost heart is indicated
even in ordinary life; such in brief is the meaning of the verse.—(26)
