He who appropriates the deposit placed with him, in the absence of
witnesses, and he who, having received it back, asks for it again,—both
these the king shall ‘*test*’;—‘*testing*’ stands for *trying to find
out the truth*,—by employing ‘*all methods*’;—‘*methods*’ stands for
*proofs*. So that if the man is found to have fallen from the path of
rectitude and denies the deposit,—then recourse may he had to heating
and imprisonment also; specially when the property involved is a large
one, the same methods have to be employed as in the case of thieves. But
no punishment shall lte inflicted if there is uncertainty in the matter.

The epithet ‘*prescribed in the scriptures*’ has been added only by way
of praise of the means to be employed.—(190)
