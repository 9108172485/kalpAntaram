‘*Śūdra*’—*i.e*., down to the *Caṇḍāla*;—‘*having
intercourse*’—sexual—‘*with a twice-born woman*’;—‘*protected or
unprotected*’—by her husband,—shall be punished according to law.

What shall be the punishment?

If he has intercourse with an unprotected woman, he shall be deprived of
his ‘*limb*,’ and also of ‘*his whole property*.’

As to the question regarding what he is to be deprived of, the answer is
provided by the epithet ‘*aṅgasarvasvi*,’ which mentions the ‘*limb*’
and the ‘*whole properly*’; especially as nothing else is mentioned, and
no other thing is specified.

The limb of which he is to be deprived is that with which he has
offended.

If he has intercourse with a ‘*protected*’ woman, ‘*he is to be deprived
of everything*,’— not of only one limb, but of the whole body.

The present verse lays down the amputation of the limb, the confiscation
of his entire property, and the inflicting of death, as forms of
punishment,—the sense being that punishment should be inflicted on the
man. Says Gautama (12.2):—In the case of intercourse with women, there
should be amputation of the generative organ and also the confiscation
of his entire property,—if she happens to be protected’—(374)
