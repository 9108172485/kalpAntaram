This text refers to persons who are not neighbours. The rule here laid
down pertains to fellow-students.

The Vedic scholar who does not entertain a duly qualified Vedic scholar
at such ‘*auspicious rites*’—rites performed by virtue of the possession
of wealth; such for instance as the feeding of many men and so forth; or
‘rich’ may be taken as an epithet of the ‘rites’; the meaning in which
case would be the rites, such as marriages and the like, which are
performed on a lavish scale; where more than twenty men are fed;—if at
such times, the Vedic scholar does not feed a fellow-scholar, ho should
be made to offer twice the quantity of the food that would be offered at
the rich rites; and one ‘*māsa*’ of gold shall be paid to the king as
fine.—(393)
