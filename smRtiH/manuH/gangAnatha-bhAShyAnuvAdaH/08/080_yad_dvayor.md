‘What you know in regard to the matter of this suit, any transaction,
secret or open, that may have been carried on between these two
persons,—all that declare freely; since you are witnesses in this suit.

‘You are the sole authority in this matter; truth and untruth are in
your hands’—thus addressed the persons cited as witnesses become
encouraged.

‘*In this matter*.’—Though the text mentions this formula in its most
general form, yet, in as much as it is not possible for any person to be
a witness regarding all things, it follows that the subject-matter of
the suit should be stated here. Because until they are informed of the
details they cannot understand the question.—(80)
