‘*Ordinary man*’—a common person; who is not possessed of any special
qualifications;—for a certain crime the King shall he fined a thousand
times the fine that would be imposed upon an ordinary man;—the
‘*kārsāpaṇa*’ being mentioned only as a standard of fine.

Since punishment is meant to accomplish a visible purpose, it is only
right that the king should punish himself also for any crime that he
commits; as it is only by doing so that he can keep other men under
check, and, in as much as he is very wealthy, he would not mind a small
fine.

On the same principle the fine in the case of the king’s
officers,—ministers, priests and others,—shall vary.

The fine imposed upon himself should be either given away to Brāhmaṇas,
or thrown into water as an offering to Varuṇa; since it is going to be
declared that Varuṇa ‘holds the sceptre over kings’ (9.245).—(336)
