If the employer does not dismiss the man, when he has fallen ill, after
having paid off his wages for the part of the work done,—then he should,
after recovery, be made to finish the work. But if the employer should
say—‘I have no work for you,’ then he should receive his wages in
accordance with the part of the work that he may have done.—(217)
