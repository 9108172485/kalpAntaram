In the case of Loan-transactions there are two kinds of security—a
Surety and a Pledge. The present verse deals with the case where the
security is in the form of a surety.

There are three kinds of Surety—(1) for appearance, (2) for guarantee
and (3) for payment. The present text refers to the surety for
appearance.

‘*If a* *man stands surety* *for* *the appearance* *of a*
*person*—saying ‘I shall produce him at such and such a place’—if he
fails to do so, he shall pay the debt out of his own property.

The term ‘*debt*’ stands for all objects of dispute. The meaning
therefore is that in suits relating to any object, the surety should
have to make good that object. In the case of defamation, assault,
adultery and other offences, if the surety has given the undertaking
that ‘if I do not produce the accused I shall pay such and such a sum,’
then he shall have to pay that sum; but in the event of there being no
such undertaking, he should he made to pay only the fine that the king
imposes upon the accused...... (?)—(158)
