Even though the maiden may be willing, if her parents and other
relatives are close hy, and their presence is not heeded by the man who,
*through sheer audacity*, relying upon his force and having the idea
‘who can do anything to me?’—and relying solely upon the maiden’s love
for him—‘*defiles her*,’—the root ‘*kṛ*’ which has many meanings, stands
here for the act *of defiling*, then ‘*his fingers should be clipped
off*’;—or ‘*he should be fined six hundred*.’

Others have held that this verse sums up what has been said (under 361)
regarding the violating of an unwilling maiden, to be punished with
‘death.’ ‘Killing’ in this connection stands for corporal
punishment—beginning with beating and ending with actual killing; and
what the present text means is that if a man defiles a maiden of a low
caste, he shall not be *killed*.—he shall have only his fingers clipped
off.
