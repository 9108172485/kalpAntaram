Just as what is done by minors and by persons who are not their own
masters, or who are not in their senses, and what is done fraudulently,
is not valid, so also is everything that is done by force. The sense of
the present injunction thus is that ‘all transactions effected by force
should be rescinded’; and ‘*what is given*,’ ‘*what is enjoyed*’ and
‘*what is caused to be written*’ have been mentioned only as examples.

‘*What is given by force*,’—*e.g*., when useless fields and farms are
given for purposes of cultivation: or when money is forcibly advanced on
interest.:—all this being forced upon people who are not desirous of
being burdened with such sifts, while they are at their own house (and
have not gone to seek for them); and it is done on the strength of an
ordinary bond (without witness, etc.).

‘*All*’—*i.e*., the transactions similar to those mentioned.

Though this matter has been already dealt with under verse CLXV where
all ‘fraudulent sales and mortgages, etc.’

are declared to be invalid, yet the two verses have been added for the
purpose of including ‘fraud’ and ‘force’ also among the invalidating
causes. Peculiar is the style adopted by Manu. All that is meant is that
‘transactions effected by persons who are drunk or insane or distressed,
or minor or senile, and also those done by fraud or force, are not
valid;—they are never valid or binding.’—(168)
