On their heads the witnesses shall place ‘*earth*’—*i.e*., clods of
earth.

‘*Wearing garlands*’—wearing chaplets as far as possible of red flowers.

‘*Wearing red clothes*’—dressed in red. Though the root ‘*rañji*’ (from
which the term ‘*rakta*’ is derived) denotes only *colouring*, *i.e*.,
imparting some colour to what is white, yet it is generally used in the
sense of *red*; as we find in such expressions as ‘the *rakta* cow’
(where the *red* cow is meant).

All this is meant to strike terror in the minds of the witnesses; and
also people dressed in red are supposed to be clean.

In swearing, each man should be made to pronounce the words—‘whatever
merit I may have acquired by my deeds, may all that become futile!’

‘*Respective*’—‘*svaiḥ svaiḥ*’;—the repetition is meant to convey the
idea that each of them should mention his ‘meritorious deeds,’—such as
the giving away of a daughter, bathing in sacred places, and so forth.

‘*Samañjasam*,’ ‘*honestly*,’ is an adverb. The meaning is that they
shall decide the case in a way that may he in accordance with truth,
straightforward and righteous. The term ‘*samañjasa*’ is synonymous with
‘honest’ and ‘clear’; and as a ‘truthful act’ is always ‘clear’ the text
has used the term ‘*samañjasam*’—(256).
