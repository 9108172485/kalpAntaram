This verse describes the effect of improper swearing, ‘*improper*’
meaning *contrary to truth*, *false*.

The gravity of the sin of ‘false swearing’ is dependent upon the nature
of the property stolen—be it goods or something else,—and also upon that
of the caste of the person involved and so forth. But even in minor
matters one should not swear falsely; in more serious matters of course,
the sin is more heinous.

‘*Ruin after death*’ consists in falling into hell; and ‘*ruin here*’ is
in the form of public obloquy, and also punishment at the hands of the
king, in the event of the true facts being discovered by other
means.—(111)
