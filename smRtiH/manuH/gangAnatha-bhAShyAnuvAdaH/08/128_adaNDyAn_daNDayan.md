title = "128 अदण्ड्यान् दण्डयन्"

The preceding verse was supplementary to the injunction regarding the
consideration of the ‘motive’ and other things; while the present verse
*prohibits* the punishing of persons who are not guilty of any offence,
and enjoins that of those who are guilty;—and this is emphasised because
of the possibility of the king regarding punishment as futile and hence
omitting to inflict it, which would lead to much evil.—(128)
