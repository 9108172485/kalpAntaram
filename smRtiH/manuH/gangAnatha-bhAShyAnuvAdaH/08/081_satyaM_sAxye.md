From this verse onward the text lays down the manner in which the
witnesses are to be exhorted.

By telling the truth, the witness attains ‘irreproachable regions,’ in
the shape of Heaven and the rest, which are the source of desirable
results.

Or, the term ‘*l oka*’ may be taken in the sense of ‘caste’; the sense
in that case would he that ‘he is born in a happy future life.’

In the present life also, he obtains ‘*unsurpassable fame*’—renown,
superior to which there is none; *i.e*., people bestow praise upon him.

Such—truthful—speech is honoured by Brahmā, Prajāpati, himself.—(81)
