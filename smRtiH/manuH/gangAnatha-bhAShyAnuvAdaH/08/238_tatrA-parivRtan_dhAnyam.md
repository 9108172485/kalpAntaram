As a rule, no crops should be grown on the pasture-lands; since if they
have been grown,—why should fences have not been put up? The fault thus
lies with the cultivator, and not with the cattle-keepers. The
cattle-keeper cannot always be leading each individual animal by the
rope; and there is no other grazing ground for the cattle.—(238)
