‘*In a place not fit for conversation*’—*i.e*., hidden from
others,—‘*who converses with the witnesses, secretly*’—*i.e*., alone,
for fear of being overheard.

‘*Who does not like the question*,’— the matter under enquiry—‘*being
investigated*’; and on the pretext of some work for the King himself, or
by the favour of the Prince or the Minister, etc., manages to gain
time;—and ‘*who falls back*,’—‘*such* a *person fails*’ is the verbal
phrase to be construed here.

The ‘*falling back*’ mentioned here is the same as the ‘*refracting*’
mentioned before (in verse 51). the purpose of such repetition of the
same idea has already been explained. We have to adopt some such
distinction in order to guard the text against the charge of containing
absolutely needless repetitions.—(55)
