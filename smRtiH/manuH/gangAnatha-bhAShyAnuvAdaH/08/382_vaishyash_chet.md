It has been said above (in 376) that in the case of approaching an
unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman, the Vaiśya ‘should be committed with five
hundred and the Kṣatriya with one thousand.’ So in the present case also
the fine for the *Vaisḥya* would be five hundred.

The heavier punishment for the *Kṣatriya* is justified on the ground
that being entrusted with the task of protecting the people, if he takes
to offending against them, he incurs a great sin.—(382)
