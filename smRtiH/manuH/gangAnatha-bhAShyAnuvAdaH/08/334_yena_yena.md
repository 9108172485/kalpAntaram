title = "334 येन येन"

+++
The punishment here laid down is meant for one who is repeatedly
addicted to stealing. If even on being found, the man does not remain in
the path of rectitude, then, after having been fined thrice or four
times, he should have his limb cut off,—irrespectively of the quality or
quantity of the article stolen, as also of any considerations regarding
his having broken through a wall or other details,—merely on the
strength of his having committed the act of stealing.

When the thief acts,—*i.e*., steals through the strength of any
particular limb,—that limb the king should ‘*take off*’—*i.e*., cut off.
For instance, if the thief depending upon his fleet foot, runs off,
under the impression that no one can overtake him,—then his feet should
be cut off. When another relies upon his knowledge of the art of
breaking through walls, he should have his hands cut off.

‘*By way of retribution*’—with a view to make him receive a reward in
keeping with his act.

Or ‘*pratyādeśa*’ may stand for *reproach*, forcible, dignified, angry
and contemptuous; consisting in the king’s declaration ‘he who acts
thus, him shall I treat in this manner.’—(334)
