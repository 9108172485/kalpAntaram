Even in the presence of convincing proof, if the debtor does not himself
admit the debt, then recourse should not be had to ‘trick’ and the other
means,—the King should be informed of it; and when summoned by the King,
if the man ‘*denies the debt*,’—saying ‘I do not owe him anything’—then,
on its being ‘*proved by evidence*’—in the shape of written document,
oral witnesses and possession,—and the man being made to confess that he
does owe the debt,—he shall make the debtor repay the ‘*creditor’s
due*,’—‘*as also a small fine*,’ a small penalty, which shall, later on,
he fixed at the tenth part of the claim.

If the man he unable to pay the whole fine, he may be made to pay a fine
even less than the tenth part. Or, the favour of the fine being
inflicted according to the man’s means,—even less than the tenth
part—may be taken as pertaining to the case of the man who denies the
debt (not through perversity, but) through having forgotten all about
it, through carelessness.

‘*Evidence*,’ proof, is of three kinds; thus enumerated elsewhere—‘If
one did not have a written deed executed, nor is there a witness, nor
previous claiming, there the only means is the supernatural one
(ordeal).’—(51)
