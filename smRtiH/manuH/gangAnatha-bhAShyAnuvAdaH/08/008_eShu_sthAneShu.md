The addition of the adverb ‘*mostly*’ is for the purpose of indicating
the importance of the said heads of dispute. As a matter of fact, there
are several other points of dispute also; *e.g*., (*a*) ‘you gave me
this house to live in; why then do you give it to another person before
the lapse of a year?’ This cannot he regarded as included under
‘non-delivery of what has been given away’; because in this case there
is no surrendering of ownership (which is a necessary condition in
*gifts*); the dweller is only permitted to dwell in the house;—again,
(*b*) ‘you have made a window in your house in front of my platform.’

‘*Taking his stand upon eternal Morality*’;—Wealth and Pleasure are not
‘eternal.’ Or, the term ‘eternal *morality*’ may mean that he should
follow that law or custom the beginnings of which cannot be traced;
while he should not pay heed to such customs as may have been adopted
only by the present generation; as such custom is *not eternal*.—(8)
