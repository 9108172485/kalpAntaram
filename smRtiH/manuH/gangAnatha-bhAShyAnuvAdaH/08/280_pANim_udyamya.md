If he raises his hand for the purpose of striking, then the hand should
be cut off,—even though he may not actually strike.

‘*Stick*’ stands for anything that hurts in the same manner as the stick
does. Hence if he strikes with the soft root of the lily and such
things, the punishment shall be less severe.

‘*If he strikes with the foot*’;—here also *raising* is to be
understood.

‘Threatening’ also is included herein.—(280)
