‘*Security*’—from thieves and such dangers, as also from his own
officers, who are prevented from inflicting undue punishments.—He who
‘*imparts*’ such security ‘*is to be honoured, ever*’; *i.e*., even in
ordinary conversation, and also when he happens to retire to the forest
on having lost his kingdom.

‘*Sacrificial session*,’—a particular form of sacrificial performance,
such as the *Gavāmayana* and the like—‘*prospers*’—becomes accomplished
in all its details; this is what is meant by the ‘prospering’ of the
sacrifice.

What is meant is that the king acquires every day the merit that is
obtained by the due performance of the sacrificial session.

‘*The gift of security*.’—In other sacrificial sessions there is no gift
or fee; the act here referred to however is superior to them all, in as
much as it is accompanied by a gift, and the gift too is not in the form
of cows and horses and the like, but of a totally different form; hence
it is only right that it should be regarded as superior to the
sacrificial session—(303).
