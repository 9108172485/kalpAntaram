In course of the treatment of ‘Sale without Ownership,’ the author
proceeds to lay down other rules also in connection with sales.

‘*Any commodity*’—such as saffron—‘*that is mixed up with
another*’—commodity, which is of an inferior quality, and which is only
similar to it—such as the *kusumbha* flower—‘*should not he sold*.’

‘*Nor what is without substance*’—*i.e*., which, having been kept closed
in a vessel for a long time, has lost its substance, has become
defective and decays, though appearing as fresh; *e.g*., cloth and other
commodities.

‘*Nor what is deficient*’;—*i.e*., less in weight or measure.

‘*Nor what is at a distance*’—away from the place of sale; and described
as ‘clothes or sugar or such things lying in my house in the village.’

‘*Nor what is concealed*’—tied up and hidden in a piece of cloth; or the
real form of which is hidden by the colour of another substance; what is
old but appears to be new is also called ‘concealed.’

Commodity of these kinds should not be sold; it shall be sold after
having been fully exposed and described; sales effected otherwise are
invalid; and there would be nothing wrong in such being revoked even
after the lapse of ten days.

Since no penalty in connection with this is here prescribed, it shall be
understood to be what has been laid down in 193 in connection with
‘fraudulent transactions’ in general.

Others, however, hold that since that penalty is laid down in another
context, that in connection with what is referred to here must he what
has been prescribed for ‘selling without ownership.’—(203)
