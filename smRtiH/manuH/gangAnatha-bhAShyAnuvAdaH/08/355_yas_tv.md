If however the man is one who has not been previously accused or
suspected, and if the conversation is found to be one bearing upon
business, then there is no guilt, as in his case there is no
transgression.

But even though not previously accused, if he converses without any
business, he becomes liable to the aforesaid punishment.—(355)
