the ‘*cotton tree*’ is a kind of tree; the board should be made out of
this tree; because its wood is naturally soft and ‘*smooth*,’ so th.it
when the clothes are beaten upon it, their component parts do not become
torn.

‘*Gently*’—so that the clothes being beaten do not become torn.

The injunction regarding the particular wood is not with a view to any
transcendental result; hence there would be nothing wrong in using any
other wood, if it satisfied the said conditions.

‘*Smooth*’—not rough.

‘*Clothes*’—belonging to one man,—he shall not ‘*carry*’— tie up and
carry to the washing place—‘*in other clothes*’—belonging to another
person; so that the clothes may not be torn by the tying, in which they
undergo a great strain.

‘*Nor shall he allow them to be worn*’;—he shall not give over, for a
consideration, to one man the clothes belonging to another, for wearing.
This is what is meant by ‘allowing to wear’; the other man does the
*wearing*, and it is the washerman that *allows* him to do it.

Since no penalty has been laid down in this connoction, we have to take
it as consisting of the ‘*māṣa* of gold’ which has been laid down
before.—(396)
