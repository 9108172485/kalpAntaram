‘*Certain*’ refers to the kind or quality of the substance, and ‘*as
much*’ to its *quantity*, *e.g*., one party says—‘I had deposited gold
with him and he is giving me back bell-metal; I had deposited a hundred
and he is giving me only half of it’;—on being asked—“Did you hand over
the deposit in secret or before witnesses?”—if he says ‘*in the presence
of a number of men*’—*i.e*., witnesses—then what these men, on being
questioned, should declare, should be regarded as the truth.

‘*Misrepresenting*’—*i.e*., asserting otherwise than this, the party is
punished.

If however the complainant says that the deposit was not handed over in
the presence of witnesses, there is an occasion for the admitting of
other kinds of proof.

This verse also prescribes nothing new.—(194)
