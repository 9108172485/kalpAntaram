To say nothing of the brother and other relatives: ‘*for the sake of the
family*,’ if even a servant should ‘*effect a transaction*,’—in the form
of selling clothes or such things, of contracting debts and doing other
kinds of business relating to the proper looking after and cultivation
of fields and barren lands,—the master of the house, whether in his own
country or abroad, on coming to know of it, ‘*shall not repudiate it*’;
*i.e*, without thinking over it, he should approve it as properly done.
The pronouns ‘that,’ and ‘what,’ refer to what is done relating to such
fields and agricultural business as may he spoilt.

Others have taken this verse as a hortatory supplement to the foregoing
verse, and not as an injunction.

But this is not right; as we find no grounds for taking it as a mere
hortatory supplement.

It might be argued that what has been said in verse 163, regarding the
‘transaction effected by the drunk, the insane, the servant, etc.,’ as
being done by persons not master of themselves, makes it clear that the
transaction effected by the servant cannot he valid.

But this must refer to the cases where the master is present on the
spot, and not otherwise; as in that case the family would he in the risk
of being ruined. Hence during the master’s absence, what is done by the
servant by the maintenance of the family must he regarded as valid (167)
