“Under verso 74 it has been already declared that even though a man may
not have been originally appointed as a witness, his evidence, as
bearing upon what is directly known to him, is admissible; what then is
the use of saying again that ‘*even though not put down*, etc., etc.’?
What additional information is provided by this verse?

People might be led to think that—‘when a man has been put down as a
witness on the original document, his evidence is admissible as a matter
of course,—but not so that of one who has not been so put down,—for if
both were admissible, then there would be no point in entering any
witnesses upon the document.’ It is with a view to set aside this idea
that the author has added the present verse. The former verse refers to
cases where no witnesses have been put down, while this refers to a case
where the document is duly attested by witnesses.

‘*Not put down*’—not entered in the document.

‘*Seeing*’ and ‘*hearing*’ have been already explained.

The rest is clear.—(76)
