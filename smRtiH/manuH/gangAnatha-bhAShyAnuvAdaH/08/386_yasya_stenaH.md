That king in whoso ‘*town*’—kingdom—there is no thief, reaches the
‘*regions of Indra*’—heaven.

‘*No adulterer*’—who has no intercourse with a married woman, or to one
married a second time. The mention of the ‘*woman*’ indicates that the
prohibition applies to the case of all such women as are not one’s own
wife, and are not related to him.

‘*Defamer*’—the man who commits the three kinds of defamation.

‘*Criminal*’—already described above.

‘*Assaulter*’—who commits physical violence.

‘*Attains the regions of Indra*’—is to be construed with each of the
phrases.

This verse constitutes a hortatory supplement to the injunctions
regarding the punishing of thieves and others.—(386)
