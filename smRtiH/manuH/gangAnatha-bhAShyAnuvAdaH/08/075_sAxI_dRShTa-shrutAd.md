The present verse describes the results accruing to the witness who
deposes falsely.

The term ‘seen and heard’ is synonymous with ‘apprehended,’ as has been
already explained; ‘*apart from this*’ is what *is not apprehended*, or
known to him;—if he asserts any such thing, ‘*in an assembly of noble
men*,’—in the court consisting of honourable persons,—he ‘*falls
downwards*’—headlong—‘*into hell*’—to a place where he undergoes
punishments at the hands of the god Yama;—‘*after death*’—‘and *becomes
shut out from heaven*,’—*i.e*., falls down. That is, even though he may
have committed deeds entitling him to go to heaven, yet he becomes shut
out from it, by virtue of the more serious nature of the sin of perjury.
It is not that the ‘*Karma*’ calculated to carry him to heaven is
destroyed by this sin; since every act is conducive to the fulfilment of
its own reward (and does not interfere with that of others), with the
sole exception of the Expiatory Rites (which have no results of their
own, and only tend to nullify those of the corresponding sinful
acts).—(75)
