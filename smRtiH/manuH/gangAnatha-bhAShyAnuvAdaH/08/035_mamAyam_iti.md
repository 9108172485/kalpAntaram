Treasure secretly buried under the ground is called ‘*nidhi*,’
‘*treasure-trove*.’ There are treasure-troves that have lain under the
ground for a hundred, or even a thousand years. If, when the ground is
being dug, such a treasure-trove is somehow found by some one, it
belongs to the state. As says Gautama (10.43)—‘Treasure-trove when found
is state-property.’ But this applies only to the case of a
treasure-trove the original hoarder of which is not known. And with
regard to this it has been laid down that one who reports the find is to
receive the sixth part of it.

The present verse refers to the case where the original hoarder is
either the person reporting the find himself or a descendant of his.

‘*If a man says* “*this is mine*” *truly*’—*i.e*., on reliable
evidence,—‘*from him the King shall take the* *sixth part*’—at which the
King’s share is fixed. That is, the King is to take the sixth part out
of that treasure-trove of which the rightful owner has been discovered
with certainty.

The option regarding the ‘sixth’ or ‘twelfth’ part is based upon the
qualities of the finder.—(35)
