‘*While he is speaking*’—while the witness is giving evidence.

‘*Knowing*,’—cognisant of what is true and what is not true.

‘*Soul*’—the Inner Guide.

‘*Does not distrust*,’—has no doubt as to whether the man will tell the
truth or not; is sure that ho will tell the truth.

He whose innermost soul is so confident,—to such a person the gods
regard no one *as ‘superior*’—more praiseworthy.

“Who is the *speaker*, and who, apart from him, is the *distruster*? In
fact, the soul is one only; when he, through his effort, utters speech,
he becomes the *speaker*; and the same entity that comes to have
‘distrust,’ when he is faced by doubts regarding *what* and *how*
tilings are going to happen; so that there cun be no difference between
the two.”

This is quite true; but the statement in the text is based upon an
assumed distinction; just like the statement ‘one injures his soul by
his own soul’ (*Bhagavad-gitā*).—(90)
