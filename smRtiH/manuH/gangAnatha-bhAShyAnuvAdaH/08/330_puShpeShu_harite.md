‘*Flowers*’—The *navamallikā* and the rest.

‘*Green com*’—while still in the field.

‘*Other unhusked*,’—‘*anyesu aparipūteṣu*’;—in as much as this has the
plural form, and ‘*husking*,’—which consists in the removing of chaff
and husks—is possible only in the case of ‘*grains*,’ we construe this
along with the term ‘*dhānyesu*,’ ‘grains,’ of the next verse. As for
‘*shrubs, creepers and trees*’ and (‘*flowers*’ which are expressed by
the only other words in the verse with the plural ending), though the
former have leaves, and the latter also are generally mixed up with
leaves, yet they are never spoken of as ‘*husked*.’

The Locative ending refers to the ‘*stealing*,’ mentioned in the
preceding verse, from where it is construed here also.

In the case of these, there shall be a fine of ‘*five kṛṣṇalas*’;—the
‘*kṛṣṇalas*’ meant being of various metals, to be determined in
accordance with the greater or less utility of the things stolen. The
ancients have held that it refers to *gold* only.—(330)
