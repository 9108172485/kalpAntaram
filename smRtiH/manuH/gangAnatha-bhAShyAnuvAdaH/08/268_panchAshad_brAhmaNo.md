‘*Abusing*’ here stands for all sorts of defamation, except the
attributing of grievous offences, for which latter other penalties are
laid down. The locative ending indicates *occasion*.

The locative in ‘*vaiśye*’ denotes the object.

The punishment for the cases where the Brāhmaṇa is the abuser or the
abused has been laid down; for finding out that for the cases of abuse
among the Kṣatriya and other castes themselves, we have to look into
other *Smṛtis*. Says Gautama for instance—‘Whenever there is abusing
between the *Brāhmaṇa* and the *Kṣatriya*, or between the *Kṣatriya* and
the *Vaiśya*, where the *Kṣatriya* abuses a *Vaiśya* he shall be fined
fifty; and where the *Vaiśya* abuses a *Kṣatrya*, the fine shall be one
hundred; similarly for abusing a *Śūdra* the *Kṣatriya* shall be fined
twenty-five, and the *Vaiśya* fifty.’

In the case of the *Śūdra* abusing a *Śūdra*, the punishment shall
depend upon their qualifications, as is going to be detailed below
(under 287 *et seq*.).—(268)
