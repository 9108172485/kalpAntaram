**(verses 8.326-329)  
**

‘*Yarns*’—woolen, jute and so forth.

‘*Salts*,’—rock-salt, black salt, and so forth.

‘*Other animal-products*’—the flesh, etc.

Other kinds of ‘*cooked food*’—such as sweet bread, sweetmeats, etc. The
term ‘*ādi*’ means *kinds*, kinship consisting in *similarity*,
*equality*, *similar utility*. It is in this sense that butter, gruel,
sugar-candy, sugar, coagulated milk, inspissated milk and so forth
become included. The term ‘*animal-products*.’ according to some,
includes the wool, the skin and so forth.

‘*And be forth*’—includes the products of the things mentioned; and as
an example of this, the text has mentioned both ‘curd’ and ‘milk.’

Similarly ‘*yarn*’ includes also cloth made from yarns.

As for the ‘*nalikā*’ and such things, even though they are made up of
yarns, and are ‘animal-products,’—yet, being already included under
‘fine clothes’ (verse 321), they are to be excluded from the present
verse.

The term ‘*taila*’ here stands for *oils* in general,—and not for the
*oil of* ‘*tila*,’ *sesamum*, only, as its derivation suggests. So that
the oils of *linseed*, *Priyaṅgu*, *cardamom* and other things also
become included.—(326-329)
