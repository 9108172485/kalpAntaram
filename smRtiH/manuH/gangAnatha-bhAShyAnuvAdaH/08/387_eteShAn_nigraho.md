‘*Paramount sovereignty*,’—lordship over others, independence.

‘*Among his* *peers*.’— the term ‘*peers*’ stands for such kings as are
his rivals. The king in question rises to lordship over all those;
*i.e*., they become subservient to him and obey bis wishes.

‘*Fame in the world*’—also is brought about.

In both cases it is the ‘suppression’ that brings about the said result.

The meaning is that people continue to eulogise the king, even though
they say that ‘he is a very cruel chastiser of the people.’—(387)
