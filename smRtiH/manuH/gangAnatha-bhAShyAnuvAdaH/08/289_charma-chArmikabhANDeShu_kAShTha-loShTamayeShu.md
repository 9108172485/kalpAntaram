Between ‘*carma*’ and ‘*cārmika*’ we have the copulative compound, and
between the compound thus formed and the term ‘*bhāṇḍa*’ we have the
Determinate Compound. Or, there is Determinate Compound between
‘*carma*’ and ‘*cārmika*,’ and Copulative Compound between the compound
thus formed and the term ‘*bhāṇḍa*.’

‘*Leathern*’ means *made of leather*; and ‘leathern vessels’ meant are
the leather-bottle and such other articles.

‘*Leather*’—stands for the mere *skin* of the cow and other animals, not
made into anything.

Or, the term ‘*leathern vessel*’ may stand for such vessels as are made
of leather only, while ‘*leathern vessel*’ for those that are only bound
up with leather.

Vessels ‘*made of wood*’—the mortar, the pestle, the board and so forth.

‘*Clay*’ is a form of earth, *i.e*., earth hardened into the form of
stone; and vessels made of these are the cooking utensils, etc.

In the case of damage done to these ‘*the fine shall be five times their
price*’; and the satisfaction of the owner has of course got to be
brought about.—(289)
