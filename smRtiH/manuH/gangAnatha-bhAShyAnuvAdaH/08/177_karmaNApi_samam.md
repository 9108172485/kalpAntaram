If the debtor has no property, he is not let off simply because he has
no property; he should he made to do ‘*labour*’; *i.e*., he should
become a servant, and the amount of wages that would, be payable to the
servant for doing the work that he does shall be credited to his
account; and when the total amount thus credited equals the sum of his
debt along with the interest, then he should be freed from service.

‘*Make good to the creditor*’; ‘*uttamarṇa*’ and ‘*udhamarṇa*’ are
relative terms applied to one or the other party on the basis of their
possessions.

The manual labour is made to be done by all who are of the same caste
as, or of the lower caste than, the creditor.

‘*The superior person*’—*i.e*., one belonging to a higher caste, or
possessed of higher qualifications—‘*shall pay it up gradually*’—*i.e*.,
according as he goes on earning. We read in Nārada—‘If the Brāhmaṇa is
poor, he shall pay up gradually according to his circumstances.’ Hence
for the liquidation of the creditor’s debts, the Brāhmaṇa shall not he
made by the king to suffer any pains; and the interests of the creditor
too have to be protected.—(177)
