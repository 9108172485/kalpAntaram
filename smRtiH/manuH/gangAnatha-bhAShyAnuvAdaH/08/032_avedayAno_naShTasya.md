This verse lays down the penalty for preferring a false claim.

He who does not provide a ‘correct’—true—account of the time and place
*of the lost article*—that ‘it was lost at such a time and at such a
place’;—‘*colour*’ white and the rest; ‘*form*’—that ‘it was a piece of
cloth, or a pair of petty-coats’ and so forth; ‘*size*’—that^(‘)it was
five cubits or seven cubits in length’;—if he fails to give a correct
account of all this, then he deserves a fine equal to the property to
which he had laid a false claim.—(32)
