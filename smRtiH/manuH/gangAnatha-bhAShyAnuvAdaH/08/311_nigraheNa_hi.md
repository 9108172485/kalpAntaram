Persons full of vice are called ‘*vicious*’; of these there should be
‘*suppressing*’ in the manner described above.

Those who behave in accordance with the scriptures are called the
‘*virtuous*’;—of these there should be ‘*fostering*,’ *i.e*., favourable
treatment to the best of one’s ability.

By this ‘*kings become purified*’— freed from sins—as if by the
performance of expiatory rites.

This is only a commendatory declaration.

Or, being ‘*purified*’ may be taken as consisting in *the non-incurring
of sin*.

Just as Brāhmaṇas are ‘*purified*’ by the ‘*daily sacrifices*’—the daily
performance of the five Great Sacrifices.—(311)
