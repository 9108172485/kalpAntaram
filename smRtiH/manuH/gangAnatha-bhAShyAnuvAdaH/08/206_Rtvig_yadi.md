This verse introduces the head of ‘Joint Concerns’: and as an example,
the author takes up the ease of ‘Joint action’ at Vedic rites.

‘*Sacrifice*’—The Jyotiṣṭoma and the rest. For the proper performance of
the numerous details of these sacrifices, when a certain ‘*priest has
been appointed*,’—with the words—‘you should perform the duties of the
‘*Hotṛ*,’ or ‘of the *Adhvaryu*,’ or ‘of the *Udgātṛ*,’—and the further
condition is made—‘you should do the work according to the
*śrauta-rules*’;—if, on account of his inefficiency or other causes, he
happens to abandon it after it has been half-done,—then the share of the
sacrificial fee payable to him shall be in accordance with the amount of
work done by him. For instance, if the man goes away after having done
only a fourth part of his work, he should be paid the quarter of the
third part of the entire ‘fee’ prescribed in connection with the
particular sacrifice concerned. This would be ‘*in accordance with the
work done*.’

‘*By h* *is* *associates*’—*i.e*., the other priests, the *Hotṛ*, the
*Udgātṛ* and the rest.—(206)
