‘*Low-born man*’— from the *Śūdra* down to the *Caṇḍāla*.

‘*Superior person*’—belonging to the three higher castes.

If the former hurts the latter with any ‘limb,’—either directly, or
through the instrumentality of a stick or a sword or some such
weapon,—then ‘*that limb of his shall be cut off*.’

The term ‘*hiṃsā*’ (*hurt*) here stands for *striking in anger,
intentionally raising the hand or some weapon and letting it fall upon
another*,—and not actually *killing*.

The repetition of the pronoun ‘*tat tat*’ (‘every such’) is meant to
guard against the idea that only *one* limb is to be cut off, which
might arise from the use of the singular number in ‘*aṅgam*’ (‘limb’).
Hence in a case where the hurt is inflicted by several limbs, all these
limbs should be cut off.

‘*Teaching*’— advice. Such is the law laid down by Manu. This has been
added with a view to make a lenient king inflict the severe
punishment.—(279)
