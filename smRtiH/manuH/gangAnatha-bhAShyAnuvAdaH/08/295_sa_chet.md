Penalty for causing hurt has been described; the text proceeds to lay
down details regarding it.

If ‘*he*’—the driver—‘*happens to be stopped*’—his movement
obstructed—‘*on the road*’— by some dense mass coming in front of him;
while thus placed behind that mass, either on account of carelessness,
or by reason of being untrained, he continues to urge forward the
animals yoked to his cart, and then suddenly pulls them up,—another cart
happens to be close hy,—then, by the sudden stoppage of the speed of his
cart, he happens to cause the death of men or other living
beings,—either through the ‘animals’—horses or others—yoked to the other
cart,—or ‘*through the cart*’ itself, or through some parts of it;—in
such a case ‘*there is no doubt regarding the punishment*,’ punishment
is certain.

Or, when the fast-running horses, on being suddenly pulled up, at the
sight of some obstacle in front, turn off sideways and kill the men that
may be there on one side, or behind the cart,—then in such a case
‘*there is no doubt regarding punishment*,’—*i.e*. there is no
punishment at all; and this for the simple reason that there is no fault
of the driver in this case.

Or, the words may he construed to mean that—when the cart is ‘*on the
road*’—*i.e., standing on the road*;—or ‘*stopped*’—*i.e., pulled
up*—then in such a case the punishment is ‘*vicāritaḥ*’ (this being the
reading in place of ‘*avicāritaḥ*’), *i.e*., specially prescribed.—(295)
