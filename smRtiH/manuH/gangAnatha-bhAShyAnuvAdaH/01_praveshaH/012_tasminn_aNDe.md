‘*Of this body, he who is the impeller*,’—to all such actions as
*moving* and the like, and who is the ‘doer’ of these acts, through his
efforts,—‘*is the Conscious Being*.’

‘*Asya*,’ ‘this’ and ‘*ātmanaḥ*,’ ‘body,’ are in apposition to one
another.

The term ‘*ātman*’ here denotes the *body*,—this denotation being based
on the fact that the *body* subserves the purposes of the *Ātman*, Self.

‘*He who does the act*’—of drinking and the like,—and who is the product
of these acts,—in the shape of the Body—becomes the ‘doer’ of acts,—is
called the ‘*material* *entity*’—an aggregate of earth and other
material substances, and belonging to an inferior category. This has
been thus declared in an old text—‘There are two selves—the Inner Soul
and the Body.’—(12)
