‘*That Supreme Lord*,’ Brahmā,—‘*for a year*,’ during a year,—‘*having
dwelt in that egg*,’—the omniscient one, who had come into existence and
was seated in the egg, thought of the way in which he would come out of
it;—‘*he broke the egg into two parts*’;—one year is the time which the
embryo takes for its development; so that after a year the egg, having
reached its full development, burst (really), by reason of its full
development having been reached. It is thus a chance coincidence that
the egg burst just at the time that Brahmā was thinking of coming out;
and it is in view of this coincidence that he is described as having
*broken the egg into two parts*.—(12)
