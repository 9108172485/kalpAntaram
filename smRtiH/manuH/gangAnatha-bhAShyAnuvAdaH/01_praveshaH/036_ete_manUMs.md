The aforesaid Great Sages. ‘*called* *into being the seven Manus*’;
‘Manu’ is the name of the office; that person is called ‘Manu’ who,
during a particular ‘*Manvantara*’ (Cycle), controls the creating and
maintaining of all created things, in the manner described.

‘*Bkūritejasaḥ*,’ ‘mighty,’ and ‘*amitaujasaḥ*,’ ‘possessing illimitable
power,’—both terms mean the same thing; the former with the nominative
ending qualifies the *creators*, and the latter, with the accusative
ending, qualifies those *created*, Manus and the rest.

*Question*:—“But the gods were created by Brahmā himself (as already
described in Verse 22).”

*Answer*:—True; but not all of them; there are endless kinds of gods.

‘*Gods*’ *habitations*’—The abode of the gods, such as the Celestial
Region, the ‘Region of Brahman,’ and so forth.—(36)
