The peculiarity of the Brāhmaṇa endowed with the qualities of learning
and the like having been described, some people might be led to
ill-treat the mere Brāhmaṇa by birth; hence with a view to prevent this,
the author has added this verse.

‘*The very genesis*’—*i.e*., irrespective of his qualities, his mere
birth, the mere ‘Brāhmaṇa caste’—‘*is the eternal* *incar*
*nation*’—body—‘*of Virtue*.’

‘*Born for the sake of virtue*,’—when the Brāhmaṇa has been duly
initiated with the rites of initiation, this is what constitutes his
‘*being horn for the sake of Virtue*’; and ‘*this* *birth leads to the
state of Brahman*’; on abandoning the ‘body of Virtue’, the Brāhmaṇa
becomes the partaker of Supreme Bliss.—says the *Śruti*. (98).
