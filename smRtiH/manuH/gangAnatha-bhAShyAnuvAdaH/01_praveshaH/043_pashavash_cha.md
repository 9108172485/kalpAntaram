These are ‘*viviparous*,’ ‘born from the *Jarāyu*’; *Jarāyu* is the
womb, the place where the fœtus lies; it is in the womb that these
beings are conceived first, and it is only when they are emitted from
the womb that they become *born*; this is the manner of the birth of
these beings.

The term ‘*dat*’ is synonymous with ‘*danta*,’ and is totally different
from it; hence it is that we have the nominative plural form
‘*ubhayatodataḥ*’ (‘with two rows of teeth’).—(43)
