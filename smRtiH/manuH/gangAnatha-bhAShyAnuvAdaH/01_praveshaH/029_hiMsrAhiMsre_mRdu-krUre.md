‘*Stupefaction*’— absent-mindedness, incapability to discriminate
between right and wrong.

‘*Of the nature of sensual objects*’—that which has the character of
sensual objects.

“The *guṇa of Tamas* is not an *object*, being something *internal*;
how, then, can it have the character of the *object*?

This is so described, on account of Delusion being the cause of
attachment to objects. That which creates a longing for a thing is said
to be of the nature of that thing.

‘*Incapable of being reasoned about*’—beyond Inference.
‘*Unknowable*’—beyond the reach of external as well as internal
organs.—(29)
