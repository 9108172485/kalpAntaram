This verse eulogises Right Behaviour iu another manner.

‘*He who departs from Right behaviour*,’—*i.e*. is devoid of Right
Conduct—does not obtain the ‘*fruit of the Veda*’; what is called ‘*the
fruit of the Veda* is the result proceeding from the performance of acts
prescribed in the Veda. Even though the man may perform the acts
prescribed in the Veda, in their entire and perfect forms, yet if he
happens to be one who has fallen off from Right Behaviour, he does not
obtain their results, in the shape of the ‘birth of a son’ and so forth.
This is the deprecation of men not following Eight Behaviour.

This same idea is expressed obversely in the next sentence.

‘*He who is equipped with Right Behaviour obtains the full reward*,’—of
all those optional acts that are done with a purpose.

In this connection some people argue as follows:—“In as much as the text
contains the qualification ‘full,’ it follows that the man devoid of
Right Behaviour does also obtain the results of his optional acts done
with a purpose,—only the *full* result does not accrue to them.”

This is not right; because the term ‘full’ is purely commendatory \[and
hence cannot be taken as having any serious import\].—(109).
