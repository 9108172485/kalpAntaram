‘*That*,’ ‘Primordial Matter—is ‘the generator of all things’:—it is
‘*imperishable*,’ *i.e*., in its original (causal) form it is
indestructible.

“In what way does Primordial Matter *generate* all things?”

Because all these *enter into it*.

“What are *all these* that enter into it?”

First of all ‘*the Mind along with its subtile components*,’—*i.e*.,
along with the Rudimentary Substances, the Principle of Intelligence,
the Principle of Egoism and the Sense-organs;—and then, the *Great
Elemental Substances*—called ‘Earth,’ ‘Water,’ ‘Fire,’ ‘Wind,’ and
‘Ākāśa;’—‘*along with their functions*;—

1.  sustaining,
2.  conglutination,
3.  cooking,
4.  configuration
5.  and making room (unobstruction) respectively are the ‘functions’ of
    Earth, &c.

Of these

1.  ‘sustaining’ means upholding, keeping in their places, things that
    are prone to falling;
2.  ‘conglutination’ means bringing together things that are loose and
    disjointed; *e.g*., loose and disjointed dust-particles are brought
    togther, cemented into, a mass by means of water;—
3.  ‘Cooking’ is the well-known effect produced by fire upon such
    tilings as medicine and herbs, &c.;
4.  ‘Configuration’ means conformation, shaping;—
5.  ‘making room’ means non-obstruction by another body; in a point in
    space where one body is already present, there can be no room for
    another body; *e.g*., no object can find room within a piece of
    gold.

‘*Mind*’—is meant to indicate all the organs of sensation; and the term
‘*Karma*’ may be taken as referring to the organs of action; or again,
in the first line of the text, the term ‘*Karma*’ may be taken to mean
the ‘products’ of the elementary substances; the sense of the passage
being that ‘subsequently the products of the elemental substances, along
with the subtile components, enter into the great elemental
substances’—‘as also do the organs of sensation,’ this latter being
indicated by the word ‘*Mind*.’—(18)
