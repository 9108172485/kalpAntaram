‘*Saṃsāragamana*,’—the property, ‘*saṃsāra*,’ ‘*series of births and
deaths*,’ stands here for the possessor of the property, *i.e*., the
personality or *Soul*, undergoing births and deaths;—the ‘*gamana*’ of
that is its migration from one body to another.—Or, ‘**saṃsā*ra*’ may be
taken as standing for the objects of the world, *i.e*., the three
Regions of the Earth, etc.;—the ‘*gamana*’ is *being born* in those
regions, as described before.—‘*Threefold*,’ high, low and
middling.—‘*Arising from actions*’—brought about by good and bad deeds.

‘*Highest good*’—the work describes not only the conditions brought
about by deeds, but also that higher than which there is
nothing,—*i.e*., spiritual knowledge,—the means of attaining that also
has been described.

‘*Of actions*’—*i.e*.. those that are enjoined and those that are
prohibited,—‘*the examination of the good and bad features*.’—(117)
