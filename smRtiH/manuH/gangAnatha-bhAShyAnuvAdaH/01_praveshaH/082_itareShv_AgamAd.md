In the Cycles other than the *Kṛta*;—‘*from the scriptures*,’ called
‘Veda’;—‘*virtue*’—‘*foot by foot*’—by one foot in each succeeding
Cycle,—‘*fell off*,’ was carried away;—the Vedic Texts disappeared, by
reason of the deterioration in the powers of learning and assimilating
of men (le arning the texts).

The ‘*virtuous acts*’—in the form of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other
sacrifices, that are performed now a days,—these also ‘*deteriorated
foot by foot*’ on account of ‘*theft*’ &c.; *i.e*., since Priests,
Sacrifices, Bestowers and Recipients of gifts, are all beset with the
said evils, the virtuous act is not accomplished in the proper manner,
and hence the result mentioned (as accruing from that act) also is not
attained. In as much as this is the real meaning, we do not take
‘*theft*’ and the rest as applied to each of the three Cycles
respectively; specially as all of them (theft &c.,) are found prevalent
even now a days (in *Kali*)—(82).
