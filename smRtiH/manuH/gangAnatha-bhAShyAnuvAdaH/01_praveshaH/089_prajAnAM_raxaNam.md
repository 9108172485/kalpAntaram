‘*In this world*’—such as the *Kārīrī* (which brings on rain), the
*Vaiśvānarī* (which secures a son), and so forth.

‘*In the next*’—such as the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the like.

All these are acts that bring about the fulfilment of some desired end.
What is ‘*Kāmya*’ (*lit*. ‘desirable’) is really the *reward*; but the
term is made applicable here to the *action* which brings about that
reward; since as an instrument, that also is ‘desirable.’

‘*Niṣkāma*,’ which is done without desire for any reward, is the
compulsory act.

‘*With knowledge*’—is to be construed with both, as a man devoid of
knowledge is not entitled to the performance of any Vedic Act If however
‘*knowledge*’ be taken as that of the *esoteric* section only, then it
cannot qualify both. \[It can go with the latter only.

The term ‘*pūrva*’ in the compound ‘*Jñānapūrvam*’ denotes *precedence*;
hence the compound means ‘that of which knowledge forms the important
factor.’ And the purport then comes to be that ‘knowledge is to be
pursued as the most important end in view; and Vedic Study and other
acts are to be pursued only to the extent that they have been enjoined
by the scriptures.’—(89)
