Among the three Time-cycles other then the *Kṛta*,—*i.e*. in *Tretā* and
the rest,—along with their ‘junctures’ and ‘juncture-ends’,—the
‘thousands’ are reduced (in each) by one; ‘reduction’ means dimunition.
That is in *Tretā*, the number of ‘thousand,’ is one less than that in
*Kṛta*; similarly the number in *Dvāpara* is one less than that in
*Tretā*; and that in *Kali* is one less than that in Thus *Tretā*
consists of three thousand years, *Dvāpara* of two thousand years, and
*Kali* of one thousand years. Similarly the number of ‘hundred’ goes on
diminishing in the ‘junctures’ and ‘juncture-ends’ of the Cycles.

‘Time-cycle’, ‘*yuga*’, is the name given to a particular aggregate of
days; and ‘*Kṛtā*’ and the rest are particular names of the said
‘Time-cycle’.—(70)
