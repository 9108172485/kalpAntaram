If the Brāhmaṇa gives up his own means of livelihood,—such as Teaching
and the rest,—and takes to the occupations of the Kṣatriya and other
castes;—similarly if the Kṣatriya and others ‘*deviate from their
occupations*’;—*they* ‘*migrate into vile migratory states*’—undergoing
the experiences of animals;—and when they come to be born among men,
they become servants among ‘*Dasyus*,’—*i.e*., robbers and other harmful
men.

‘*In normal times*’—This is a mere reiteration; since such deviation
having been permitted in *abnormal times*, there would be no impropriety
involved in it.—(70)
