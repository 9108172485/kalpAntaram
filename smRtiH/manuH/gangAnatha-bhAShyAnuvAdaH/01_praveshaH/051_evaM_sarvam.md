‘*Of three kinds*’—arising from speech, mind and body.

‘*Thrice*’—according to the three qualities of ‘*Sattva*’ and the rest.

‘*Threefold*’—as divided into ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ and ‘middling.’

understood as resembling, and hence included among, those already
mentioned.

indicative of what is to follow.—(51)
