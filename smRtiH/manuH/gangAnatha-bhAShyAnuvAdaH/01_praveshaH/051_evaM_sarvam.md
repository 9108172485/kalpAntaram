‘*Thus*’—*i.e*., something directly himself, and some under Prajāpati’s
directions, the Blessed Lord,—having *created* produced,—*all this*
world,—and having directed to maintain (keep going) this world;—‘*He*’
whose ‘*power*,’ sovereignty over all things, is ‘*inconceivable*,’
amazingly great, the Creator,—‘*disappeared*,’—brought about his own
absorption *i.e*., having renounced the body that he had, of his own
will, taken up, He again became unmanifest;—‘*within himself*;— other
things become absorbed in the Root Evolvent; but He did not become
absorbed in any thing else, He disappeared within his own self; He has
no other source wherein He could, like other things, become absorbed;
for the simple reason that all beings have their source in Him. Or
‘*disappearing*’ may mean desisting from the entire worldly process.

‘*Repeatedly suppressing time by time*’—the Present-participle
(‘suppressing’) is connected with the verb ‘having oreated’; the meaning
being—‘destroying the time of dissolution by the time of creation and
maintenance’;—‘again and again; it will lie described later on that
‘there are endless creations and dissolutions.’—(61)
