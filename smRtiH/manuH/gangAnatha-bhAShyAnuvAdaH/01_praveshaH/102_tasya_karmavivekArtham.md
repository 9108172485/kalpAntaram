This verse serves the purpose of indicating the upshot of the entire
eulogium pronounced on the Brāhmaṇa (in the foregoing verses);—\[the
sense being\]—‘These institutes are so important that they serve the
purposes of the Brāhmana who is endowed with a high degree of supremacy
due to his own inherent excellence’;—‘*for the puryose of regulating the
actions*,’—*i.e*. for the purposes of *regulating*, in the form ‘such
and such acts should be done, and such and such others should be
avoided’;—‘*of others also*,’ *i.e*. of the *Kṣatriya* and the
rest;—‘*Incidentally*,’—*i.e*. primarily for the Brāhmaṇa, and only
incidentally for the *Kṣatriya* and other castes;—‘*he elaborated*.’—set
forth,—‘*these institutes* .’—(102)
