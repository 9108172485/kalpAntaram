‘*Union with Brahman*’—becoming one with Brahman, (*i.e*., attaining
Brahman).

‘*In whatever*’—*i.e*., even though he may not take to the several
stages in the regular order. This is what has been referred to in such
passages as—‘Brāhmaṇas, deviating from the regular path, pass on to the
stage of the Mendicant immediately after passing through that of the
Student.’—102
