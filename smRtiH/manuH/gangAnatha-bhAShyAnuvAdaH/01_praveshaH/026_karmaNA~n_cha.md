Such in general is the character of these, pervading over all living
beings.

‘*Knowledge*’—cognition.

‘*Ajñana*,’ ‘*Ignorance*’—stands for *Delusion*; not for the
unconsciousness caused by intoxication, swoon or such other causes.

‘*Rajas*’ has a two-fold character; the two terms ‘*rajas*’ and
‘*tamas*,’ being indicative of two distinct characteristics.

Those who are influenced by knowledge and wisdom are never affected by
too much anger, nor are they ever careless.

‘*Vapuḥ*,’ ‘*nature*’—character.—This is all-pervading, because the seed
of impressions is never destroyed, lasting as it does till one has
attained Brahman—(26)
