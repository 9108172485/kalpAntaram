‘*Tridaṇḍam*’ is an *aggregate of the three controls*; the feminine form
of which is precluded by reason of the term ‘*daṇḍa*’ occurring in the
‘*pātrādi*’ group \[and hence falling under the exception to the
*Vartika* on Pānini, 2.4.17\].

He who ‘*keeps*’—fixes up—‘*this triple control*’—in his heart,—‘*in
regard to all creatures*’— not harming any, by any of the three kinds of
action’—and ‘*rightly*’—properly—‘*subdues desire awl anger*,’—‘*thereby
attains*’—obtains—‘*success*’—in the form of Liberation.

This verse serves as introductory to the treatment of the philosophy of
the Self; leading up, as it does, to such questions as—‘to whom does
this *success* belong?’ ‘who is the real experiencer of the results of
actions?—since the body is found to end in ashes, and we do not see
anything else of the man.’ It is thus that the text proceeds to describe
the *person* who is the actual performer of all acts, righteous and
unrighteous.—(11)
