When a man perforins a certain act with a disposition partaking of the
quality of ‘Sattva,’ or of that of ‘Rajas,’ or of that of ‘Tamas,’—the
act also partaking of one of these same qualities of *Sattva*, *Rajas*
or *Tamas*,—then it is ‘*with a body of the same quality*’—*i.e*., by
one abounding either in *Sattva* or in *Rajas* or in *Tamas*—that ‘*he
reaps the result thereof*,’—this result also partaking of either
*Sattva* or *Rajas* or *Tamas*.

Inasmuch as such is the law, if a man’s act is such as partakes of
*Rajas*, and has its source in an evil disposition of mind, the man
obtains undesirable results; hence one should avoid such acts and should
take to such as have their source in the right disposition.—(81)
