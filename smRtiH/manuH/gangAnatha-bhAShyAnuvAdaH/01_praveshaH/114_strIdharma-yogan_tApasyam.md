‘*Who have not fulfilled their duties*’;—what has been already asserted
before is stated here in the negative form.

When persons fulfilling their duties and learned in the Veda lay down a
certain law, no doubts should be entertained regarding it,—either by
learned or by ignorant men. Nor should any optional alternatives be
admitted in such cases.—(114)
