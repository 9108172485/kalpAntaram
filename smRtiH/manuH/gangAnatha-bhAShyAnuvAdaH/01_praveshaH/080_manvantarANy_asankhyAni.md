‘*Innumerable*’—Whose number is not limited.

*Objection*—“In works on Astronomy and other subjects we find the number
of *Manvantaras* stated as *fourteen*.”

Our answer is that they are ‘*innumerable*’ in the sense that they
revert repeatedly; in the same manner as the ‘twelve months.’

Of ‘*Creation*’ and ‘*Dissolution*’ also the repitition never ceases.

‘*He calls into being all this as if in amusement*’:—An *objection* is
raised—“A man takes to an amusement only when he seeks for pleasure; as
for the Supreme Lord, since he has all his desires fulfilled, and since
his very form consists of pure Bliss, his acts of creation and
dissolution could not be due to *amusement*.”

It is in view of this fact that the author has added the qualifying term
‘*as if*.’ The real answer to the objection however is what has been
stated above \[in the *Bhāṣya* on verse 21, where it has been pointed
out that creation and dissolution are primarily due to the previous acts
of living beings.\] The answer provided by the ‘Knowers of Brahman’
(Vedāntins) is that in ordinary life also, in the case of kings and
other such persons, it is found that they often act for mere diversion,
without desire for any particular thing—(80).
