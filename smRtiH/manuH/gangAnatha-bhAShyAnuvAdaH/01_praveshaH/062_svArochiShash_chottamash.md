The aforesaid Manus are now mentioned by name.

‘*Glorious'* is a qualifying epithet.—The other words are names; some
being merely conventional, and others based upon relationship; the last
name ‘*Vivasvat-suta*,’ ‘*Son of Vivasvat*,’ is a different kind of
word; it is a name bearing the form of a compound; just like the names
‘Black-serpent,’ ‘*Narasiṃha*’ (Man-Lion) and the like.
