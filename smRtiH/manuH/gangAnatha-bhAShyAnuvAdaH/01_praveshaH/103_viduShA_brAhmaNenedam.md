‘*Ignoramuses*’—ignorant men; those who do not read at all.

‘*Who* *read the* *books*’—those who have studied the texts, and are
just able to mention them.

Better than these are those who ‘*retain*’ them; those who read the
books with care; while the former do not read with sufficient care. The
‘*retainers*’ also are of *the books*.

What the *superiority* of these latter means is that they are qualified
for being engaged in recitations, for receiving gifts, and so forth.

‘*Those who have knowledge*,’ are qualified for all purposes; and hence
these are still better. Recitations and prayers, when done with
knowledge, are productive of more excellent results. This is what has
been thus described—‘Whatever one does with knowledge, faith and with
due regard to the esoteric teachings, turns out to be most effective.’

‘*Those who act*’—Those who, without any hesitation, act up to the
teachings of the Veda; and who never doubt their correctness.

This also is meant to be mere praise: Mere study of the Veda is capable
of accomplishing the ends of man,—how much more so the knowledge of what
is contained in it!—(103)
