All sacrificial rites, heaven and other rewards, and all the gods—should
be looked upon as the ‘Self’: What is known as the ‘God Agni’ is the
Self, apart from which there is no ‘God’—This is what is meant by such
declarations as—(*a*) ‘This Self is found spoken of in various
forms’;—(*b*) ‘the one Self is the God’;—(*c*) ‘Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra are
described as *Agni*,’—‘One real entity the wise ones speak of in various
ways’;—all which goes to show that when men have notions regarding the
‘*gods*,’ what they have is only the idea of the ‘*Self*’ in its various
forms. The assertion that ‘the man has passed beyond all that exists’
indicates that one should look upon all ritualistic deities as the
‘Self.’

“Does this mean that in actual practice, these gods should not be
treated as *gods*?”

All that is to be done is to be done as being done for the Self. And the
reason for this lies in the fact that it is the Self that brings about
‘*the connection of all beings with actions*’;—and there is no other
God, even approaching It in quality.—119
