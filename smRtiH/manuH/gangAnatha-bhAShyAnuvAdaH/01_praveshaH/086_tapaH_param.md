Another difference in the character of the Cycles is now described.

As a matter of fact, Austerity and the other Virtues are not prescribed
in the Veda with reference to any particular Cycle, all of them should
be performed at all times; hence the description contained in the
present verse has got to be explained somehow or other. In fact it is in
the Itihāsas that the distinction herein set forth is met with. \[When
‘Austerity’ is relegated to the *Kṛta* Cycle\] what is meant is that it
is the principal—and hence the most effective—Virtue cultivated; and the
men being longlived and free from disease are most capable of performing
Austerities.

‘*Knowledge*’—i.e. of spiritual matters. Though the men \[being not
quite so healthy in the *Tretā* as in the *Kṛta* \], suffer in the body,
yet this bodily suffering does not render the internal discipline
(necessary for spiritual knowledge) very difficult.

In as much as there is not much trouble in the performance of
*Sacrifices*, sacrifice forms the chief virtue in *Dvāpara*.

In *Charity*, there is neither physical suffering, nor need for internal
discipline or much learning; hence it is easily done.—(86)
