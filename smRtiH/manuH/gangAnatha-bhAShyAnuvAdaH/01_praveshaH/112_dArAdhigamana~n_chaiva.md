The meaning of the Veda is understood with the help of Nirukta,
Vyākaraṇa and Mīmāṃsā. A knowledge of these should be possessed by all
the three persons, as these do not help the comprehending of the meaning
of any one Veda only, and not of others. Hence a knowledge of these is
essential in all cases.

The distinction of the three Vedas—Ṛgveda and the rest—has been
mentioned on the basis of the distinction made in the
*Gṛhyasūtras*.—(112)
