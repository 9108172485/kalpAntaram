The word ‘being’ stands for all such things on earth as Trees and other
immovable things, and also such movable

things as insects, beetles and the like.—Among these, the ‘*animated
ones*’—*i.e*., those that are capable of such activities as eating,
moving and so forth,—are ‘*foremost*’; being aminated, they experience
more powerful pleasures.—Among these latter, ‘*those that subsist by
reason*,’—*i.e*., those that discriminate between wholesome and
unwholesome, such for instance, as dogs, jackals and other animals \[are
foremost\]; these animals, when suffering from heat, more into the
shade; when suffering from cold, they betake themselves to the sun; they
give up a place where they find no food.—Among these latter again, ‘*men
are foremost*’; and of them, ‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’ They are the most highly
honoured; they are never ill treated by any person; in fact the killing
of the Brāhmaṇa involves a serious expiatory rite, which is due entirely
to considerations of caste. (96).
