‘*One year*,’ of men,—*i.e*., twelve months,—‘*forms* *the Day and Night
of the Gode*.’—The division of these is by means of the ‘Northern
Course’ and the ‘Southern Course’; the six months during which the Sun
moves towards the North is the ‘Northern Course,’ ‘*Udagayanam*’; the
term ‘*ayana*’ standing for *moving* or *occupying*; the meaning being
that during the six months the Sun rises towards that particular
quarter. Turning hack from that, there comes the ‘Southern course’;
during these six months the Sun abandons the Northern quarters and rises
towards the South.—(67)
