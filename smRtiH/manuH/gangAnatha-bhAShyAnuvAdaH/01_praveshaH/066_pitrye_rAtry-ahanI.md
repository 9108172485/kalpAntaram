That which is the ‘month’ of men is a ‘day and night’ of the ‘*Pitṛs*.’
As regards ‘division’ as to which part is ‘day’ and which ‘night,’—this
division, that ‘this is *day* and that is *night*,’ is determined ‘*by
fortnights,’ i.e*., the *fifteen days*, which are known by the name of
‘half-month.’ That is, the said division is based upon fortnights: one
fortnight is ‘day,’ and another fortnight is ‘night.’ In view of the
fact that ‘day’ and ‘night’ differ in their character and occur in a
fixed order of sequence, the author adds the following distinction:—The
darker fortnight is ‘day,’ and the brighter fortnight, ‘night.’

The right reading (in view of the meaning intended) would be
‘*Karmaceṣṭābhyaḥ*’ (the Dative form), just as we have ‘*svapnāya*’; for
the meaning meant to be conveyed is that the day is *for the purpose* of
‘activity.’ Hence the Locative ending in the text can be explained only
as used on account of the exigencies of metre.—(66)
