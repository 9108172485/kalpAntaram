Having raised the question that, if the Brāhmaṇa happen to be
discontented and should again undertake to receive gifts, he would incur
sin,—the Author offers his answer to it in this verse.

‘*All this*’—*i.e.*, whatever wealth exists in the three worlds—‘*is the
property of the Brāhmaṇa*’; so that for him there can he no ‘acceptance
of gifts’; what he takes possession of, he does by virtue of his being
its possessor, and not as the receiver of a gift.

This is mere praise, not an injunction; hence we have the word
‘*deserves*’.

‘*Noble birth*’—high hirth, superior character. (100). VERSE CI.
