‘*I called into being*,’—produced,—‘*the ten Great sages*,’ who are
‘*the directors of all created things*’;— ‘*at the very outset, having
performed most arduous austerities*’—austerities that were performed
with great difficulty; *i.e*., which bring suffering and take a long
time.

The ten great sages are mentioned by name (in verse 35).—(34-35)
