Thousand ‘Time-cycles’ of the Gods make one ‘day’ of Brahmā.—Brahmā’s
night also ‘*is of the same extent*’—*i.e*., as long as thousand
‘Time-cycles’ of the Gods.—‘*In number*’ —*i.e*., which in computation,
is *one thousand*; the adding of this term is only for the purpose of
tilling up the verse; for a thing cannot be spoken of as a‘thousand’
except *in number*.

The instrumental ending (in ‘*Sāṅkhyayā*’) denotes *causality*.
