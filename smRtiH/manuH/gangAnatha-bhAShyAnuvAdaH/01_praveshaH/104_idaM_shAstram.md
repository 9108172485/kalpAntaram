Having thus, indirectly through its co-relative, eulogised the
Institutes as serving the purposes of the Brāhmaṇa, the Author now
proceeds to eulogise them directly.

Knowing these Institutes, the Brāhmaṇa, comes to ‘*discharge all
prescribed duties*,’—*i.e*. he observes all observances and practises
full self-control; having learnt from the institutes that the omission
of duties is sinful, he, fearing sin, fulfils all active and passive
obligations (relating to observances and self-control),—doing everything
in full conformity to the Institutes. Thus fulfilling all his duties,
‘*he is not defiled*’—affected—‘*by the sins*’ arising from the omission
of duties prescribed and the commission of deeds prohibited.—(104)
