The said six principles of their own respective evolutes,—to these he
joined their subtile components, and thus created all beings.

The number ‘*six*,’ (mentioned in connection with the Principles) is
made up of the *five* ‘Rudimentary Substances,’ to be described later
on, and the ‘Principle of Egoism’ already described.

The ‘*own envolutes*’ of these Principles, are their respective
products; *i.e*., the elemental substances, which are the products of
the‘Rudimentary Substances,’ the Sense-organs which are the products of
the ‘Principle of Egoism.’ The Eaṛth and the other Elemental Substances
being present, like so many ‘bodies,’ he joined to them the ‘subtile
components’; *i.e*., the Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism; that is, he placed them in their proper places, and thus
‘*created all beings*,’—Gods, men, animals, birds, trees and so forth.

The meaning is as follows:—The six subtile components are productive of
one portion of the entire world, the whole of which is evolved out of
them; that they are ‘subtile’ is proved by the fact of their being
‘rudimentary’ in their character;—these he ‘*combined*,’ *i.e*., brought
together, *with their own envolutes*,’ *i.e*., their respective
products; he produced the material substances and the organs (of
action), and through these, the entire material world; these latter
being indicated by the word ‘even.’

In place of ‘*mātrāsu*’ it is better to rend ‘*mātrābhiḥ*’.—(16)
