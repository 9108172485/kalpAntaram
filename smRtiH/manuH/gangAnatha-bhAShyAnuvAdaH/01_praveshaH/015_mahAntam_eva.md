The term ‘*form*’ stands for all material products; all these emanate
from the ‘body’ of the Supreme Self;—this body consisting of his
*essence* alone; and the mention of the two (the *Self* and His *body*)
as distinct being analogous to the expression ‘the body of the
stone-image’ \[where also the body is nothing different from the image
itself.

‘*Innumerable*’—endless.

‘*Emanate*’—issue forth.

This emanation being like that of the waves from the ocean.

It is by these forms, as they become emanated, that this world becomes
*energised*,—*i.e*., set into activity. The world is spoken of as
becoming ‘energised’ by these forms, because, as a matter of fact, there
is no ‘activity’ without the body, the organs and the sensations.

Others explain that the ‘body’ of the Supreme Self is Primordial Matter,
not the *material substances*; and all activity is dependent upon this
latter.—(15)
