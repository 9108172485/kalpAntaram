This verse sums up what has been said in regard to the diversity in the
nature of things based upon the difference in time.

The word ‘*Dharma*’ here is not restricted to the sense of *sacrifice*
and such other acts (prescribed by the Veda); it stands for the
*characteristic* of things in general. The meaning thus is that in each
Cycle, the character of things varies, as shown before (in verses 83 and
84); just as, for instance, the character of things during the Spring is
of one kind, of a different kind during the Summer, and of yet another
kind during the Rains,—so it is in connection with the Cycles also.

By ‘*difference*’ it is not meant that things cease to bring about
effects that they are found (at one time) to produce, and bring about
other effects; what is meant is that they become incapable of bringing
about their complete effects; and this by reason of the decrease in
their potency. This is what is meant by the phrase—‘*this being due to
the deterioration of each succeeding Cycle*,’—‘*deterioration*’ meaning
*inferiority*.—(85).
