The author mentions Time, because it belongs to the same category (of
‘action’) as Duty. It is only according to Vaiśesikas that Time is a
*substance*; according to others it is a form of *action*; it consists
in the extension of the motions of the Sun and other planets, and is
liable to return.

‘*Divisious of Time*’—such divisions as into ‘month,’ ‘season,’
‘half-year,’ ‘year’ and so forth.

‘*Lunar Mansions*’—such as *Kṛttikā* (Pleiades), *Rohiṇī* (Aldebaran)
and the rest.

‘*Planets*’—Sun and the rest.

‘*Rivers*’—streams.

‘*Oceans*’—seas—and ‘Mountains.’

‘*Even tracts of land*’—such tracts of land as are of one uniform form,
devoid of ditches and holes.—‘*Rugged tracts of land*’—such as are high
and low.—(24)
