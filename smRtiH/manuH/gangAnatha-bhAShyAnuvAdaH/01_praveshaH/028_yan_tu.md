The meaning of this verse is as follows:—Even though Prajāpati, being
the supreme director of the creation of things, can create living
creatures just as he chooses, yet, as a matter of fact, he creates them,
not without reference to the actions done by them during the preceding
cycles; he makes the creature born in that family of creatures which is
indicated by the act done by it during the previous cycle,—and never in
any other family; if the creature has, in the past, done a good act, it
is led to be born in a family in which it would be enabled to experience
the good results of that act,—in such families for instance, as ‘God,’
‘Man’ and so forth; if, on the other hand, the acts of the creature have
been bad, it is born in such families as ‘animals,’ ‘evil spirits’ and
the like. What happens is that at the beginning of each new creation,
the acts done by creatures in the previous cycle come out, after having,
during Dissolution, lain latent within their source; just in the same
manner as the Elements, the Organs and the Constituent Attributes come
out at the beginning of each creation, after having lain latent within
their source, in the Boot Evolvent. And the reason for this lies in the
fact that the law relating to the ‘residue of the past’ (affecting the
future) applies with equal force to the case in question also.

*Question*:—“If the coming into existence (of a creature) is dependent
upon its own past acts, where then does the almighty power of Prajāpati
come in? Of what sort too would be the almighty power which is dependent
upon extraneous influences?”

*Answer*:—It is only when the said almighty power is there and (active)
that the world comes into existence; how then can the said power he said
to have no effect at all? In fact, neither continuance, nor production,
nor dissolution (of the world) is possible except when that power is
present,—the power of God being ever present, at all times. In reality,
what lead to a creature being born are (1) acts done by itself, (2) the
will of Prajāpati and (3) the evolution of the Root Evolvent. It is by
all this set of causes that this world is produced, exists and becomes
dissolved. The mere fact of Prajāpati being influenced by the things
does not deprive him of his almighty power. The case stands upon the
same footing as a king bestowing upon his servants and dependents the
rewards for acts done by them; exactly in the same manner Prajāpati
assigns to each creature what is in accordance with its previous acts;
and yet neither the King nor Prajāpati cease to be ‘all-powerful.’

*Objection*:—

> “The meaning assigned to the verse does not appear to be its right
> meaning at all. What appears to be its right meaning is that the
> Creator is entirely independent in assigning their work to the
> creatures. The verse thus means as follows:—‘*Every creature conformed
> to*,—*i.e*., carried on—*that same action*—in the form either of
> *doing harm to others*, or its contrary,—*to which the Lord had
> directed it at*—at the beginning of creation’; that is, man does not
> have recourse to actions, cither entirely on the advice of his father
> and other elders, or by his own will; in fact, whatever good or bad
> action he performs, he does wholly in accordance with Prajāpati’s
> directions, entirely uninfluenced by the advice of any other person.
>
> ‘*When created again*’—*i.e*., when born again, whether in another
> cycle, or in this same cycle,—it is Prajāpati alone who directs all
> animate beings to be the doers of actions; hence even past good and
> bad acts arc done by them only in obedience to the directions of
> Prajāpati; this has been thus declared:—‘They become agents without
> being masters of their own actions; to the good or the bad act they
> are led on by God’; and again ‘this ignorant creature has no control
> over his pleasure and pain; it is only as led on by God that he goes
> to heaven or to hell.’”

To the above we make the following reply:—If the suggested explanation
were accepted, (1) it would mean the abandoning of the idea of an
inseparable connection between Actions and their results,—(2) it would
also mean that all human effort is useless (everything being determined
entirely by the independent will of God),—(3) and it would mean that the
injunctions of the *Agnihotra* and such acts, as well as the worshipping
of Brahman, are entirely futile; in fact it would come to this that
actions for visible or invisible results would be undertaken by only
such men as are ignorant of the nature of God; while those who are of
opinion that the doing of actions and the enjoying of their results are
dependent on the will of God would never engage in any form of activity;
they would keep away from activity under the impression that ‘even
though an action may be done, its result may not follow (if God so
wished it), and even though we may not do the act, we may enjoy its
results (if God so willed it).’ Especially because the desire for being
the doer of a certain act does not arise in the man forcibly through the
prompting of God, as illness arises from unwholesome food; on the other
hand, if the said desire is held to be determined by the connection
between the action and its result,—the idea being that ‘this result
follows from this action’—then it would not be true that ‘the Lord
directed the man to the act’ (as the text says).

The *direction* by God, spoken of in the text can be admitted only on
the authority of the scriptures; and in the statement—‘*that action to
which the Lord directed him at first*,’—the phrase ‘*at first*’ is used
in reference to the present, since the world is beginningless (so that
‘at first’ could not mean *at the beginning of creation*)’, and as
regards the ‘direction’ or ‘supervision’ by the Lord, this extends over
all tilings (not only to Actions), he being the efficient cause of Time
and Space (within which all things have their being). \[In this way the
idea of God’s supervision is not incompatible with the theory that
results accrue to men from their own acts.\]

Other people offer the following explanation of the verse:—When a
personality happens to be born in a different animal-species (from that
in which it was born in its former life), it does not require the
effects of its former conditions; nor is there the resultant continuity
of its former nature; when, for instance, a certain personality happens
to be born in the foline species, which species God originally prompted
to such acts as the killing of others and the like,—it renounces the
quality of mercy which it may have practised during its human existence,
and acquires the quality of that species in which it is born, even
though this latter quality may not have been taught by any one. What is
meant is that the actions due to the nature of the personality being
ordained by God are extremely potent, and make the personality forget
its former habits.

The idea contained in this verse is further expanded in the following
verse.—(28)
