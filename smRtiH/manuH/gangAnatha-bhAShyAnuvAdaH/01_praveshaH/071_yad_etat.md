‘*Yadetat*’ (in the sense of ‘this’) is an ordinary expression; and as a
whole it means *that which has been spoken of*.—‘*This period of four
Time-cycles that has been* *computed*’—*i.e*., the exact number of years
in which have been definitely determined before this verse,—e.g. in
verse 69, where the number of years in the Time-cycles is declared to be
*four thousand* etc., etc.,—‘*Twelve thousand*’ of this period of four
Time-cycles are called the ‘*Time-cycle of the Gods*’. That is to say
the *Divine Cycle* consists of twelve thousand ‘Four-Cycles.’

The word ‘*Sāhasram*’ is derived from the word ‘*sahasra*’ with the
reflexive affix ‘*aṇ*’; and the compound ‘*dvādaśasāhasram*’ is to be
expounded as ‘*dvādaśa-sahasrāṇi parimāṇe yasmin*’, ‘that in which the
measure is that of twelve-thousands’.—(71)
