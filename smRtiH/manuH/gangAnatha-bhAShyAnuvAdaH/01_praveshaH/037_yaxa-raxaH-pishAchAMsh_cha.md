The various forms of the Yakṣa and other beings here mentioned can be
known only from the *Itihāsas* and such other sources; they cannot be
known by any of the ordinary means of cognition, perception and the
rest.—The ‘*Yakṣas*’ are the followers of Kuvera;—‘*Rākṣasas*,’ Bivīṣaṇa
and others;—beings more cruel than these last are ‘*Piśācas*,’ who live
in unclean places and in deserts, &c., and are inferior to *Yakṣas* and
*Rākṣasas*; though all three are mischievous; by trickery they draw out
the life of living beings, and by some invisible power they bring about
diseases: so say persons knowing the *Itihāsas* (stories) and *Mantra*
(Incantations).—‘*Gandharvas*,’ are those followers of the Gods whose
chief work consists of singing and dancing;—‘*Apsarases*,’ the
courtezans of the Gods, Urvaśī and the rest;—‘*Asuras*,’ the Gods’
enemies, Vṛttra, Virocana, Hiraṇyāksa and so forth;—‘*Nāgas*’ (the Great
Serpents), Vāsuki, Takṣaka and the rest;—‘*Sarpas*’ ** (Serpents) are
well known;—‘*Suparnas*,’ the great Birds, Garuḍa and the
rest;—‘*Pitṛs*,’ named ‘*Somapa*,’ ‘*Ayyapa*’ and so forth, who reside,
like Gods, in their own regions; the ‘*several orders*’ of these
also;—all these (the mighty sages) called into being.—(37)
