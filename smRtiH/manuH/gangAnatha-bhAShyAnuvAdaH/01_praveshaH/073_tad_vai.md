‘*Yugasahasrāntam*,’—‘that of which the thousand cycles are the
end;’—those men who know this, ‘*they are the people who alone know what
is Day and Night*.’

If it be asked—what happens to the people who know this?—it is added
that ‘*they acquire merit*.’ Such is the connection (of the word
‘*puṇyam*’). The sense is that ‘knowledge of Brahmā’s Day and Night is
conducive to merit, and hence this knowledge should be acquired;’—this
injunction (of acquiring the said knowledge) being implied by the
valediction contained in the verse.—(73)
