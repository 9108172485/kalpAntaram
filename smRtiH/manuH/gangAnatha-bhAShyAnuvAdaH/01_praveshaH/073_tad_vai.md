For the purpose of alienating the listener from that slight pleasure
which is obtained by persons obsessed with notions of duality, from
sensual objects,—such as attachment to wife and children, greed for
wealth and other things,—and which obstructs the acquisition of true
knowledge, the text describes the actual condition of men dining
transmigration.

In the proportion that men go on repeating their enjoyment of
objects,—such men as are ‘*sensually inclined*,’ *i.e*., those who have
a hankering for objects of sense. What is indicated by the term
‘*ātman*’ in this connection is that when a man becomes addicted to a
certain course of action, it comes to form his very ‘nature’ (*ātman*).
For instance, if a man happens only once in a way to eat to his fill,
his hankering for it appears only when he is reminded of it; if, on the
other hand, he does it daily, it becomes his very *nature*.

This same idea is asserted by the clause—‘*in that same proportion their
ardour for them goes on increasing*.’—The term ‘*kuśalatā*,’ ‘*ardour*,’
connotes *complete identification*; and when one has completely
identified himself with sensual objects, he can never avoid them.

This same principle applies also to such enjoyments as are not forbidden
for cultured men,—such, for instance, as intercourse with one’s own
wife, enjoying things obtained with money obtained from the sanctioned
sources of income, and so forth;—ton much addiction to all which becomes
forbidden.—(73)
