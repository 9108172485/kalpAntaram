‘*In this manner*,’—refers to the manner discribed above;—‘*by these
high-souled sages*,’—Marīci and the rest;—‘*all* *this, movable and
immovable, teas called into their actions*,’—the creation of each being
was in keeping with the nature of the action done by it during other
lives; that is, each being was made to be born in that family of animals
which was the right one for it, in view of its past acts;—‘*under my
direction*’—by my order;—‘*through the force of austerities*,’—having
performed severe austerities; what this is meant to show is that any
kind of great power can be acquired only by means of austerities.—(41)
