The author now begins to describe the measures of time, which are taught
in the Science of Astronomy, for the purpose of determining the exact
duration of time of the continuance of the world and its dissolution.

Eighteen ‘*nimeṣas*’ go to make that measure of time which is known as
‘*Kāṣṭhā*’;—thirty ‘*Kāṣṭhās*’ make one ‘*Kalā*’;—thirty ‘*Kalās*’ make
one ‘*Muhūrta*,’ and ‘*as many*’—*i.e*., thirty;—thirty ‘*muhurtas*’
make one ‘*Ahorātra*’ (Day and Night).

‘*Should be known as*’—this verb has got to be supplied.

‘*Tāvataḥ*,’ ‘a s many,’ is the Accusative Plural form.

“What is it that is called *Nimeṣa*?”

‘*Nimeṣa* is the natural *winking* of the Eye-lashes, which accompanies
every opening of the eye. Other people have declared that ‘*Nimeṣa*’ is
that time which is taken in the distinct utterance of one
letter-sound.—(64)
