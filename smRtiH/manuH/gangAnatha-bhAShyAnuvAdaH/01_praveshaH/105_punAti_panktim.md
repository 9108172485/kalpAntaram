He becomes the sanctifier of his company; ‘*company*’ stands here for a
number of persons arranged in a particular order; this ‘*he purifies*,’
makes free from taint; *i.e*., all sinful men, by associating with him,
become sinless.

‘*Kindreds*’—persons born in his own family ;—‘*seven higher*,’ those
above him, the Father &c., and ‘*seven lower*,’ those that are to come,
yet to be born.

He alone is entitled to receive the gift of this earth extending to the
oceans; ‘knowledge of Dharma’ establishes a claim to become the
recipient; hence it is that a full knowledge of Dharma is sought to be
acquired.—(105)
