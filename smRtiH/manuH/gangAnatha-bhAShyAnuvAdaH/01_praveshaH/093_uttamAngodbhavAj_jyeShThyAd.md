This verse explains what follows from what has been said in the
preceding verse. ‘*The best part of the body*,’—the head; from out of
that sprang, was born, the Brāhmaṇa.—He is also ‘*the eldest of
all*,’—the Brāhmaṇa was produced before the other castes .— ‘*Because he
upholds the Brahman, i.e., Veda*’; the upholding of the Veda has been
specifically prescribed for him.—‘*Hence*,’—for all these three
reasons,—‘*the Brāhmaṇa is the lord*,’—*i.e*., as if he were the lord
—‘*of this whole world*’; *i.e*., he should be approached (treated) like
the lord; and people should obey his orders in matters relating to
*Dharma.—‘Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’ means ‘*dharme prabhuḥ*,’—‘Lord in matters
regarding *Dharma*,’—the affix ‘*tasi*’ (in ‘*dharmataḥ*’) being added
according to the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 5.4.44, which lays down the use of
this affix in connection with such terms as ‘*ādya*’ and the like. (93)
