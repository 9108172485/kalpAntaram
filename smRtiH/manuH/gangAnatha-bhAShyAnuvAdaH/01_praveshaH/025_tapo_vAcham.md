Though every entity is possessed of the three qualities, yet if any one
of these should happen to ‘*wholly*’—entirely—‘*predominate*’—exceed
others—in a body, on account of the influence of his past deeds, that
quality suppresses every other quality of that person; hence, the owner
of that body comes to ‘*abound in that quality*’; that is, in his
character, he shows signs of that quality and abandons in the other
qualities.—(25)
