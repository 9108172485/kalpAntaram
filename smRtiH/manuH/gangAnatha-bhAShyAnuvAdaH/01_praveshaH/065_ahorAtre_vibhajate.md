‘*Ahorātra*’— ‘day’ and ‘night’; of these the Sun makes the division;
the Sun having risen, so long as his rays are visible, it is called
‘day’; and from the time that the Sun sets to the time that he rises
again, it is called ‘night.’ Such is the case in the region of men and
in the region of Gods.

“In a place where the Sun does not reach with his rays,—how is one to
make this division of ‘day’ and ‘night’?”

The answer to this is given in the second line—‘*what is conducive* &c.’
For such beings as are self-illumined, as the light is always there (and
it never ceases) the division of ‘day’ and ‘night’ is made according to
the *undertaking of actions* and *going to sleep*. Just as in the case
of herbs, the time for sprouting is fixed by nature, exactly in the same
manner, in the case of the beings in question, the times of ‘activity’
and ‘repose’ are fixed by the nature, of time itself \[and are not
variable\].—(65)
