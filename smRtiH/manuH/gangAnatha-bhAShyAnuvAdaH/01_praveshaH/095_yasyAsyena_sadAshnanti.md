The author proceeds to show the above-mentioned ‘conveying of
oblations.’

‘*Tṛdivaukasaḥ*’—are those whose habitation consists of the ‘third
heaven,’ *i.e*., the denizens of heaven, the Gods.—The Gods accept the
food that is eaten by the Brāhmaṇa: in connection with ‘*Śrāddha*’
offerings also, the feeding of Brāhmaṇas has been laid down as to be
done for the sake of the *Viśvedevas* (a class of Gods),—this feeding
being a part of the offering to the *Pitṛs*. What is stated in the text
is with reference to these facts.

‘*What being is superior*’—*i.e*. greater—‘*to him*’—than him? This
means that the author himself ‘forgets’ (cannot think of) any being who
could be so superior.

The Gods, occupying the highest regions, and the *Pitṛs* occupying the
intermediate regions,—both are imperceptible; hence there is no other
means of feeding them except though the feeding of Brāhmaṇas;—hence the
Brāhmaṇa must be superior. (95).
