‘*Highest Dharma is Morality*’ \[Right Behaviour\]; that which has been
prescribed in the *Śruti, i.e*. Veda; and also ‘*that laid down in the
Smṛti*.’ Hence one should be ever *intent upon* Dharma in the shape of
Right Behaviour *i.e*. he should carry it into practice.

‘*Ātmavān*’—*lit*. ‘endowed with soul,’ really means ‘*desiring the
welfare of his soul*’; all men are ‘endowed with soul’; hence the affix
‘*matup*’ is taken to mean ‘welfare of soul.’—(108).
