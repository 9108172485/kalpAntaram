The superiority of the learned rests on the fact that it is they alone
that are entitled to the performance of sacrifices that lead to great
results. Among these ‘*those with firm convictions*’—who have acquired
firm knowledge of the essence of the Veda, and are never affected
(adversely) by *Bauḍḍhas* and other heretics.—Among these again ‘*those
that act up to them*’—*i.e*., the performer of actions; these persons
doing what is enjoined and avoiding what is prohibited, are never
attacked (by evil).—Among these, *those that know* ‘*Brahman*’; those
that know Brahman become of the nature of Brahman, and therein lies
imperishable bliss. (97).
