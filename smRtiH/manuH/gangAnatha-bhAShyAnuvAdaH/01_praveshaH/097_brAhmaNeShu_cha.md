This also is in praise of the Veda.

‘The *four castes*’ are learnt from the Veda,—*i.e*., the duties of the
four castes ate tints known; *e.g*., ‘the Brāhmaṇa shall be initiated
during the spring, the Kṣatriya during the summer,’ and so forth. As for
the external features they are the same in all castes, and can be
definitely ascertained only by experience; as we have shown elsewhere.

‘*The three worlds*’—Such texts as ‘the gods subsist upon offerings from
this world’ indicate that the Veda points out the means of subsistence
for all the three worlds; specially as the *Smṛtis* (which contain
details regarding these matters) also have their source in the Veda.

The ‘*life-stages*’ also are learnt from the Veda.

Similarly the ‘*past*’ births, pleasures and pains;—the
‘*present*’—current,—and the ‘*future*’—what is to come; for the
knowledge of all this one must seek help from the Veda.—(97)
