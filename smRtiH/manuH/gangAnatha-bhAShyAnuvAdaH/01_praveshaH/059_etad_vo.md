‘*This*,’ Law;—‘*to you*’;—‘*Bhṛgu will describe fully*,’ will carry it
to your cars, will teach and will explain: The pronoun ‘*this*’ (in the
second line) refers to the *Law*; the whole of this Law this Sage has
‘*learnt*,’ read, ‘*in its entirety*,’ ‘*from me*’ at my hands. The
teaching proceeds as it were, from the Teacher’s mouth, and the pupil
takes hold of it, as it were; it is for this reason that we have the
affix ‘*tasi*,’ in the word ‘*mattaḥ*,’ in the sense of the Ablative.

*Bhṛgu* is a person whose greatness is very well known to the sages; so
that by directing him to explain the Law, Manu shows that the Law has
come down through a tradition of teaching handed down by a long line of
several persons possessing exceptional knowledge of all sciences. It is
for this reason that some people are to undertake the study of the Law
by the following considerations:—‘This Law has come down from several
high-souled persons,—why then should we not study it.’ This
consideration serves to prompt men to study and thus attracts them to
the Law.—(59)
