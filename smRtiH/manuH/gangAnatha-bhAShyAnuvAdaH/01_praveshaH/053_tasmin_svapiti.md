The meaning of this verse is quite clear, its meaning having been
already explained.

‘*Having retired within himself*’—*i.e*., in calm repose, i *e*., in
pure pristine nature of the Soul at rest;—‘*retiring within himself*’
stands for the cessation of all accidental diversities.

‘*Active*’—the conscious beings who are fallen in the cycle of births
and deaths, and for whom *Action* is of the greatest
importance;—‘*embodied beings*,’—so called because they feel the effects
of being connected with a body which is the effect of their own past
acts.

‘*When he slumbers*,’ all these ‘*desist from their actions*,’—this
stands for the cessation of their *bodily* activity;—‘*their mind falls
into depression*’—this stands for the cessation of their mental
activity. Thus this cessation of bodily and mental activities indicates
the state of Dissolution.—‘*Depression*’ means absence of energy,
disability to carry on its functions; this is what the Mind *falls
into*,—attains.—(53)
