‘*Invested with minute particles*’—that which is constituted by
*minute*, subtile, *particles*, parts. This may refer either to the
‘*Puryaṣṭaka*,’ or the ‘Intermediate Body’; or to the Soul itself;—all
Souls being by their very nature, *subtile*; as stated in such texts as
‘This Self within the heart, is extremely minute.’

‘*Seed*’—The source of the physical body;—‘*Immoveable*,’ that which is
the cause of the birth of trees, &c.;—‘*Moveable*,’ animate.—‘*Enters
into*,’ becomes enclosed in;—then ‘*united with the aforesaid*,’—*i.e*.,
with Prāṇa and other constituents of the subtile body)—then ‘*it
assumes*,’ attaches to itself, the body; *i.e*., takes up the new
corporeal frame.—(56)
