‘*Clumps and Thickets*’—is the name given to the cluster of those shoots
that grow together in large numbers, having one or several roots, and do
not attain any considerable height; *e.g*., Copses and the like. Or
‘*guccha*’ ‘Clump’ and ‘*gulma*’ ‘thicket’ may be taken as two different
things; the difference between the two being that, while one bears
flowers, the other is flowerless.—Other ‘*species of grass*—*e. g.,
kuśa, śādbala, śaṅkhapuṣpī* and so forth.—*Lowspreading tendrils*—the
long shoots of grass spreading on the ground.—‘*Creepers*’—are those
shoots that grow out of the earth and clinging round a tree or some
other object, rise upwards.—All these, like trees, ‘*grow out of seeds
and slips*’—(48)
