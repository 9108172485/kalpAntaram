The divisions of time have been described. The qualifications of the
Brāhmaṇa and the other people are now described; and the present verse
serves as an introduction to that subject.

‘*Of this entire creation*,’—*i.e*., of all beings,—‘*with a view to the
protection*’—for the purpose of their safety;—the Resplendent One,
Prajāpati,—‘*ordained*,’—distributed—‘*the functions*,’—*i.e*., actions,
leading to perceptible as well as imperceptible results,—of the Brāhmaṇa
and other castes, that sprang from his mouth and other limbs. (87).
