is stated again for the purpose of pointing out the details not set
forth before.

*Vikurute*, ‘*evolves*,’—*i.e*., being impelled, by Brahmā, it brings
about creation in a particular manner;—from out of the ‘Mind’ (*i.e*.,
the Great Principle of Intelligence), thus propelled (to modification)
is produced *Ākāśa*; and this *Ākāśa* possesses the quality known as
‘Sound ‘*Quality*’ is that which subsists (in a substance); and the
substratum of the quality of Sound is *Ākāśa*, in the sense that no
Sound is possible apart from *Ākāśa*.—(75)
