title = "099 ब्राह्मणो जायमानो"

The Brāhmaṇa comes to the top of the entire world; this ‘coming to the
top’ indicates his supremacy.

‘*He is the Supreme Lord of all beings*’,— and this supremacy comes
about for the ‘*purpose* *of guarding the treasure of
Virtue*.’—‘*Treasure*’ means a collection of objects; hence through
similarity, the collection of Virtues is called ‘treasure’ (99).
