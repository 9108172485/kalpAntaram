The present verse further confirms the complete character of the
Treatise. ‘*Laws of countries*’—those that are observed in particular
countries, and not over the whole earth;—‘*Duties of castes*’—those
pertaining specifically to the Brāhmaṇa and other castes.—‘*Laws of
dynasties*’—those promulgated by famous dynasties;—‘*Heresy*’ consists
in the keeping of such observances as are prohibited; and ‘*laws of
heretics*’ are those laws that are based upon heterodox treatises; the
‘heretics’ being described (in 430) as ‘persons addicted to improper
deeds.’—‘Guilds,’ companies; of traders, artisans, actors and so forth.

All these laws and duties the revered ‘*Manu has expounded in these*
*Institutes*’—(118)
