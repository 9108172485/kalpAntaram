That great sage ‘*Bhṛgu*,’ ‘*bring thus directed*’—prompted, by means of
the words ‘Bhṛgu will describe it to you’;—‘*thereupon*,’—after
that,—‘*said to the sages*’—‘*Listen*.’

‘*With a gladdened heart*’;—his gladness being due to the idea of
respectability implied by the fact that from among the several pupils
(of Manu) he had been directed to teach; Bhṛgu’s idea of his own
respectability was based upon this idea—‘I, who am an obedient pupil of
Manu, have been thus honoured by him, by reason of my special aptitude
to expound the Law.’—(60)



\[*Here ends the introductory Section—describing the true origin  
of the Law and the authorship of the present Treatise*.\]

\[*Now begins the actual Text of the Treatise, as expounded by  
Bhṛgu, to the sages who had questioned Manu*.\]
