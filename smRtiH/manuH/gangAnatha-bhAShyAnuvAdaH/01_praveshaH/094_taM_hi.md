This verse serves the purpose of pointing out the details of the three
reasons set forth in the preceding verse.

In the case of the ordinary man also, the head is the most important
part of his body. ‘*Him*’—the Brāhmaṇa;—‘*Self-existent one created*
*out of* *his* *own* *mouth*’; and this creation out of his mouth came
about after he had performed austerities.

The fact of the Brāhmaṇa being the ‘*eldest*’ is vindicated by the term
‘*in the beginning*.’

That which is done for the benefit of the Gods is called ‘*offering*’;
and that which is done for the benefit of the *Pitṛs* is called
‘*oblation*’;—‘*for the conveying of*’ these two,—*i.e*., for presenting
them to the Gods and the *Pitṛs*. In the term ‘*abhivāhyāya*,’ the
verbal affix (*ṇyat*) has the nominal force, which may be explained
somehow or other; the root ‘*vaḥ*’ being transitive.

By the said act (of conveying the oblations and offerings) is
accomplished ‘*the preservation*,’—nourishment—of this whole Trio of
Worlds: the gods live upon offerings made from this world (by men),—the
Gods again nourish plants and herbs and make them ripe by means of cold,
heat and rains; this mutual benefit leads to ‘*preservation*.’ (94).
