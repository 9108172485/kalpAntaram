‘*That kind of action which belongs to the several beings*,’—*i.e*.,
hurtful or harmless—‘*has been already described*’;—now ‘*I am going to
explain the manner of their birth*.’

*Objection*.—

> “Where has the *action* been described? In Verses 37 *et seq*. what
> occurs is only the mention of the names of several beings, *Yakṣa,
> Rākṣasa* and the rest; and their action is not mentioned at all.”

Our answer is as follows:—The action of each being is indicated by its
name; the particular name being acquired by each being by reason of its
actions: for instance, the *Yakṣas* are so called because of the act of
*worshpping*, or *pervading* (‘*Yakṣaṇa*’);—the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ are so
called because of the act of *destroying in secret* (‘*rahasi
kṣaṇana*’);—the *Piśāchas* are so called because of the act of devouring
flesh (‘*piśitāśana*’);—the *Apsarases* are so called because of the act
of *issuing forth from water* (*adbhyaḥ ṣṛtāḥ*);— the *Asuras* are so
called because of the act of *not obtaining surā*, in the form of
nectar; and so on, the significance of the other names may be traced.

‘*The manner of their birth*’—*i.e*., they are *viviparous, oviparous*
and the like; going to be described in the following verses.—(42)
