The creation described here is apparently of another Being; but others
have held that it is of the same *Brahmā*; the meaning being that the
body that came out of the Egg being divided into two halves, ‘*with one
half he became Male*’—*i.e*., he became a male being, capable of
instilling semen—and ‘*with the other half he became the Female*’; that
is, his body assumed the form of the Hermaphrodite, like *Gaurī-Śaṅkara*
(combined in a single body). Or, it may mean that he crested the Female
apart (from the Male).—Having created her, he produced, from her, by the
act of procreation, that being whose well-known name is ‘*Virāj*.’ What
is meant is that Prajāpati had recourse to his own daughter.

This mention of the bifurcation of Prajāpati’s body is based upon the
fact that the husband and wife differ only in their bodies, and in all
functions they are entirely united.—(32)
