‘*Full of bliss*’—a feeling of happiness.

‘*Śuddhābham*’—that which *appears pure*, not tainted by ‘Rajas’ and
‘Tamas,’ and hence free from passions, vanity, love, hatred,
covetousness, delusion, fear, grief and jealousy. This condition is one
that should be realised by the man himself, at some time or the
other.—(27)
