This verse sums up what has gone before.

‘*Of the half-ten*’—*i.e*., of the five elemental substances;—‘*the
subtile*,’—minute,—‘*constituents*,’—parts; *i.e*., the ‘Rudimentary
substances’; these are ‘*evanescent*’;—they are called ‘evanescent’
(liable to destruction) in the sense that, being liable to undergo
modifications, they take up grosser forms.—‘*along with those*,' ‘*this
whole*’—world,—‘*comes forth*,’—is produced;—‘*in due order*,’—in proper
sequence; *i.e*., from the subtile the gross, and from the gross the
grosser; or in the order in which they have been described (in the
foregoing verses).—(27)
