“There is happiness in pleasure also; so what has been described as the
characteristic of ‘Sattva’ (under Verso 27, above)—‘when one feels
bliss, etc., etc.,’ would apply to this also; how then can it be the
distinguishing feature of ‘Tamas,’ which is of the nature of
‘stupefaction,’ while in Pleasure, there is keen consciousness, which
also is a characteristic of ‘Sattva,’ since it has been declared above
that ‘Sattva is knowledge, etc.’? (26).”

The answer to the above is as follows:—What is set forth in the present
verse is not the condition of the *Agent* or of the *object* of
experience; what is meant is an excessive longing for a certain end; and
certainly at the time of the *longing*, there is no happiness, since the
object longed for is not there.

Thus then, whenever a man has an excessive craving for Pleasure, he
becomes deprived of the power to discriminate between right and wrong,
and is really in a state of stupefaction. It is this sort of craving
that is meant by the term ‘pleasure,’—and such desire as for the company
*of* one’s wife during her ‘season.’—(38)
