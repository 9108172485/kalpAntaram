The semi-brilliant flash of light seen within the clouds is called
‘*lightning*,’ of which the other names are ‘*Sandāminī*’ and so forth,
which are based upon certain peculiar characteristics;—‘*Hails*’—
stone-like finely visible snow-particles, which, propelled by strong
winds, fall like torrents of rain and destroy corns and other
things;—‘*Clouds*,’ consist of the combination, in the atmosphere, of
vapour, water, air and light;—‘*Vertical phosphorescence*,’ is an
upright mass of violet-colon red luminous matter, occasionally visible
in the sky; it is seen sometimes attached to the disc of the sun, and
sometimes in other places also;—a particular Form of the same is called
‘*Rainbow*,’ which

differs from the former in being curved in the form of a
bow;—‘*Meteors*,’ are those stars which are seen to fall as portents
during twilights and at the advent of night, diffusing their brilliance
all round;—‘*Portentous sounds*,’ are sounds emanating from the Earth or
Sky, which are regarded as foreboding calamity;—‘*Comets*,’ the
well-known stars with protruding crowns, seen during a public
calamity;—as also various kinds of other stars, *Dhruva, Agastya,
Arundhatī* and so forth.—(38)
