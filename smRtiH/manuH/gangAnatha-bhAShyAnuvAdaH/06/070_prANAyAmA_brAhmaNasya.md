By using the term ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ the text implies that what is mentioned
constitutes the duty of the whole caste, and is not restricted to the
Renunciate only.

‘*Even three*’—more than three lead to more excellent results; *three*
are absolutely necessary.

‘*Vyāhṛti syllables*’— those mentioned under 2.81.

‘*Praṇava*’—the syllable ‘om’.

The breath-suspensions are to be ‘*accompanied by these*’.—This
indicates the duration of the breath-suspension.

These breath-suspensions are of three kinds, named ‘*Kumbhaka*’ (total
suspension), ‘*Pūraka*’ (inhaling) and ‘*Recaka*’ (exhaling). The total
suppression of air passing out of the mouth and the nostrils constitutes
the (inhalation and suspension); and when the man does not inhale breath
but continuously keeps on exhaling, it is called ‘Recaka exhalation.’
The exact duration of each of these has been described under Discourse
II. Or, in view of its being spoken of as ‘austerity,’ it may be
continued till it becomes actually painful.—(70)
