‘*Vaitāna*’—*Śrauta*.

These fires he shall reposit within himself, by swallowing their ashes
and perfoming such other rites as have been laid down in connection with
it. The exact procedure of this *repositting* should be learnt from the
*Śravanaka* (?).

When austerities have been performed for a long time, and the man has
reached seventy years of age, then, still remaining a hermit, he shall
be ‘*without fires and without a house*’; *i.e*., he shall give up his
thatched dwelling-house.

“Where then should be live?”

He shall dwell ‘*at the roots of trees*’,—as is going to be said in the
next verse.

‘*He shall be a silent hermit’.—The* construction is ‘*muniḥ* *syāt*’,
‘he shall be a *muni*’; which means that he shall keep his speech under
control; the man who has his speech under control is called ‘a keeper of
the vow of silence’.

‘*Living upon roots and fruits*’.— This serves to exclude all other
kinds of food; he shall not eat even *Nīvarā* and the other wild
grains.—(25).
