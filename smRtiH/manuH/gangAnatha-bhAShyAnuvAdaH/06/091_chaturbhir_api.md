This verse introduces what is going to be described below.
‘*Ten-fold*’—That which has ten ‘folds’ or forms.

‘*Be observed*’—Always be performed.

Though all these have already been mentioned before, yet they are
repeated here in order to indicate their great importance; and this
repetition also lends support to the view that it is the combination of
‘Knowledge’ and ‘Action’ that accomplishes the hightest end of man—(91)
