title = "045 नाऽभिनन्देत मरणम्"

+++
This denotes freedom from troubles.

He shall not seek death; nor shall he seek life, for the purpose of
acquiring more knowledge.

‘*He shall await his time*’.—He shall cultivate the habit of thinking
‘let anything happen at any time it may’.

‘*Just as the servant waits for the fulfilness of his contract*’—‘This
work I have got to do for him during the day,—if I stop in the middle, I
shall not obtain full wages’.

Worldliness having thus ceased, when the man’s body falls off, he
attains Liberation, by this process and not by doing whatever he
likes.—(45)
