He shall make no effort to obtain things that give pleasure; *e.g*.,
troubled by heat, he shall not move into the shade, and troubled by
cold, he shall not kindle fire. If, however, his sufferings are removed
by such natural causes as the falling of the sun’s rays and the
like,—this is not forbidden. This rule refers to seasons other than the
rains; because special rules have been prescribed with special reference
to this latter Reason.

Or, the text may be taken as prohibiting the use of medicines by the
hermit if he happen to fall ill,—being cured of disease also being a
kind of ‘pleasure;’ hence he shall not make any effort to secure this
pleasure.

‘*Sleeping on the ground*’;—*i.e*., he shall sleep on the ground,
covered only with grass.

‘*Shelter*’— dwelling-places, such as houses, tree-roots and so
forth;—for these he shall not care; he shall not have any hankering
after the possession of these.

He shall make the roots of trees his dwelling. In the event of their
being not available, stone-slabs, mountain-caves and such places have
also been ordained for him.—(26).
