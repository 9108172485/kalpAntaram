‘*Paying off*’— Clearing off the debt.

‘*One shall turn his mind towards Liberation*’.—The term ‘liberation’
here indicates the stage of Renunciation; it is this stage that is
spoken of as the principal path which leads to Liberation only; not so
the other stages (which lead to other results also); hence
‘*liberation*’ means the *Stage of Renunciation*.—(35).
