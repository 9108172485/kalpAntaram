‘*Seven openings*’—(1) Duty and wealth, (2) duty and pleasure, (3)
wealth and pleasure, (4) pleasure and wealth, (5) pleasure and duty, (6)
wealth and duty, and (7) wealth—pleasure—duty. He shall not utter an
untrue word spreading over all these. All these are based upon notions
of *diversity*; and all diversity is untrue; hence the word relating to
these is called ‘untrue’.

The sense is that the man shall speak only such words as pertain to
Liberation.

Or, the ‘*seven openings*’ may stand for the seven breaths in the head;
and these are the ‘openings’ of speech. Or, it may stand for the six
sense-organs and Intellect as the seventh. It is only when objects have
been perceived by means of these that words speak of them. Others
explain that the ‘*seven openings*’ stand for the seven declensional
terminations.—(48).
