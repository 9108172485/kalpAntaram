The abandoning of the *Śrauta* fires has been mentioned before; this
verse speaks of the abandoning of the *domestic* fire. Or tins may be
taken as forbidding the act of cooking, and of seeking for fuel for the
fire required for the allaying of cold and such other purposes.

‘*Niketa*’ is home.

‘*He may go*’—for one night—‘*to* *a village for food*’; and having got
what he needs, he should spend the rest of his time in the forest. This
living in the village for a single night has been declared by Gautama.
If the man happen to be near a village, then he shall enter it only for
obtaining food; but if he happens to be far off from it, then he may
dwell there for a single night, and pass on to the forest for the
second.

‘*Disinterested*’;—he should not own his even such inanimate objects as
the water-pot and the like. Or, it may mean that he shall not have
recourse to any remedy for his bodily ailments.

Some people read ‘*asaṅkusukaḥ*’;—‘*saṅkusuka*’ means fickle, unsteady;
and the opposite of this denotes firmness of mind.

‘*Silent*’—with the organ of speech under his full control

‘*Calmly disposed*’— Calm in disposition; *i.e*., he shall give up all
mental imaginings; he shall be calm by *disposition* not in mere speech
(43).
