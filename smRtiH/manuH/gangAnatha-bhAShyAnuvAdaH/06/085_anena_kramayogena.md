described as consisting of the combination of action and

shakes off evil by means of self-knowledge. This has been thus
described—‘Just as the water does not become attached to the. lotus-leaf

‘*He attains the Supreme Brahman*’—becomes one with Brahman, having got

the proper fulfilment of the duties of the particular life-stage.—(85).
