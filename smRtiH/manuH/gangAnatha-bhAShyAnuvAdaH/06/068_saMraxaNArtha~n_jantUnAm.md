This verse shows the necessity for what has been said above (46)
regarding the treading on the ground ‘sight-purified.’

‘*Even* *during bodily illness*’—when the body is suffering from some
disease;—‘*during day and night*’— when the grass-bed has been spread
for sleeping, he shall not lay down his body upon it without having
carefully looked over it. The transgression of this rule involves the
necessity of performing an expiatory rite.

Or, the text may be taken as referring to those minute animalcules that
become attached to the man’s body and perish by the mere moving of the
limbs.—(68)
