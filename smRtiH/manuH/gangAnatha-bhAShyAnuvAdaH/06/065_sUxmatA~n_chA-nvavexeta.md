‘*Meditation*’—steadiness of the functioning of the mind, as described
by Patañjali. By means of that, ‘*he shall recognise the subtile
character*’ of the conscious entity in the body, the soul; and he shall
not look upon either the body etc. or the life-breath etc, as the
‘Soul,’ which latter is to be understood, by the help of intuition born
of meditation, as something different from all external and internal
things;—this is what is meant by the text. Of the Soul, there are no
grosser manifestations. And just as he can realise the ‘possibility of
its presence’—in the higher organisms in the form of the bodies of the
Gods and other such beings—*i.e*., the fact of its ensouling these
bodies and pasting through experiences born therein, even though in
reality it is omnipresent,—exactly in the same manner can one realise it
also in the lower organisms, of lower animals, spirits, demons and so
forth.

According to the philosophy of Monism, the souls in the organisms are
only so many manifestations of the Supreme Self; and it is for this
reason that the text has spoken of the man recognising the ‘*t*
*ransmigrations* of the Higher Self.’—(65)
