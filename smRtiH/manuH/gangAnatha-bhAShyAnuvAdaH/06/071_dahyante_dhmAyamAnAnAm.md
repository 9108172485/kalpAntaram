When the ‘metallic ores,’ of gold for instance, are blasted in a
furnace, what is left behind is pure gold; similarly when the senses
apprehend their objects, the man feels joys and sorrows, and these are
productive of sin; this sin is consumed through the suspension of
breath.

For the man seeking Liberation, indulging in joys and griefs has been
forbidden.

But even in a man who has given up all attachment, and has his organs
under his control, these are bound to appear, in howsoever small a
degree, through the sheer nature of things, whenever by chance various
kinds of colour, sound &c. become presented before him. And it is for
the removal of the taints due to these that breath-suspensions have to
be practised.—(71)
