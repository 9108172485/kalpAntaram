‘*Having studied the Veda*’;—this implies that the Veda shall not be
given up. This has been already explained above.

The right reading would appear to be the present-participial form
‘*abhyasyan*,’ ‘studying.’

‘*He shall live at ease under the protection of his son*’;—*i.e*., if he
has a son born to him; or of any other person who may be in the place of
his son; such, for instance as his grandson. They say that in this case
also one should retire to another house.—(95).
