*Skin*—of the bull, the deer and other such animals.

‘*Cīra*’—a bit of cloth.

^(‘)*Evening*’—end of the day.

‘*Morning*’—opening of the day.

This rule regarding bathing in the evening implies that the man is to
eat at night only; because Bathing after meals is forbidden.

This view, some say, is not right; because among the observances of the
Accomplished Student, it is said that ‘after taking his food he shall
bathe’ (which shows that bathing after meals is not entirely forbidden),
in fact this bathing after meals is declared in the *Mahābhārata* as to
be done by each and every person.

It is open to the Hermit to bathe thrice during the day—this being a
matter of option.

‘*Matted locks*, *beard, hairs on the body and nails*’;—all this he
shall not have cut.—(6)
