If the phrase ‘*grains fit for hermits*’ is not connected with what has
gone before, then there is no room for the objection—“how can the
sacrificial offerings be made, which are laid down as to consist of
*Vrīhi* and other cultivated grains?”

The ‘boiled mess’ and ‘cake’ meant here are those that have been
prescribed by the rules laid down for Hermits.

‘*Vāsanta*’—those that grow, or ripen, during spring; similarly
‘*śārada*’.

^(‘)*Sacred*’—this is a mere re-iteration.

^(‘)*Which he has himself gathered*’.—This forbids such means of
livelihood as receiving gifts and the like. For the due fullilment of
the aforesaid s *mārta* rites, grains have to be gathered by wandering
hither and thither.

‘*According to law*’, ‘*severally*’.—Both these terms are added for
filling up the metre.—(11).
