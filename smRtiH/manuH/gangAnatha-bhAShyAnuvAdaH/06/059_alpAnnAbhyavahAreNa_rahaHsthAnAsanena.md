‘*In solitude*’—in a place devoid of people—he shall stand and sit.

This indicates that ‘subjugation of the senses’ is the result of living
in solitude. Or, it may be taken to be indicative of *freedom from
curiosity*.

He shall not stay even for a moment at a place where large number of
people, men and women, with various kinds of dress and ornaments,
congregate.—(59)
