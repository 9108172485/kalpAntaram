The ‘*Aparājitā*’ is the name of the North-Easterly direction, known
among the people as ‘*Aiśānī*’;—‘*Having fixed upon*’ this direction—as
“this is the direction towards which I shall go’,—he should proceed
towards it.

‘*Moving straight on*’—not swerving from his path, not seeking to avoid
even rivers and streams. This is a rule laying down the going towards
the North-East.

‘*Intent*, *living upon water and air, till the falling off of the
body*.’—That is, until the body falls off, he shall live upon air and on
water.

‘*Intent*’,—having concentrated himself by the rules of Yoga.

This refers to the ‘Grand Journey’ (towards certain death).—(31).
