‘*Having renounced all attachments*.’—‘*Attachment*’ stands for the
notion of ‘mine’ that people have with regard to such things as the cow,
the horse, the elephant, gold, slaves, wife, agricultural lands, houses
and so forth. When this has been renounced, and the man has begun to
delight in solitude;—having taken to this as the principal method, and
in the manner detailed above—*i.e*., by the due performance of the
temporal and spiritual acts prescribed—he ‘*reposes in Brahman*,’—which
is of the nature of pure consciousness; and he is no longer fettered by
actions. This is what is meant by the phrase ‘*from ail pairs of
opposites*’—*i.e*., pleasures and pains as resulting from good and bad
acts.—‘*he* *becomes freed*’—(81)
