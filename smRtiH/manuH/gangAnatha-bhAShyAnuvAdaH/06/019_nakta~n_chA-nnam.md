Two meals having been prescribed for the man’s ordinary purposes, the
present text lays down the dropping of one of these meals for the
Hermit. The sense is that as age goes on advancing, the man should go on
dropping the mealtimes one by one. The ‘fourth’ meal-time is to be
computed in the same manner us the ‘eighth’: Three days having elapsed,
if one eats in the evening of the fourth day, he comes to be regarded as
eating ‘*every eighth time*’. The act of *eating* being the
subject-matter of the context, the ‘fourth’ (or ‘eighth’) time has to be
taken as referring to that act.—(19).
