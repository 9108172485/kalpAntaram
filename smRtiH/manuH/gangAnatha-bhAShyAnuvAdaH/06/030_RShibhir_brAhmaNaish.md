It has just been stated in general terms that ‘he shall attend to
*others*’; this might be taken to imply the propriety of practising the
restraints and observances laid down in the ‘*Śākya*’,
the^(‘)*Pāśupata*’ and other heterodox scriptures. Hence the present
verse is added for the purpose precluding these.

‘*By sages*.’—The *Mahābhārata* describes several restraints and
observances practised by the ancient sages.

Those attended to by ‘*Brāhmaṇa-householders*’;—as has been declared
under Gautama (3.9)—This refers to those coming later, also, because
there is no incompatibility in this.’

‘*Knowledge*’—the realising of the unity of the Self; this one should
‘*advance*’—confirm, strengthen—by the study of the Veda.

‘*For the purification of the body*’—he should attend to the restraints
relating to the regulation of food—(30).
