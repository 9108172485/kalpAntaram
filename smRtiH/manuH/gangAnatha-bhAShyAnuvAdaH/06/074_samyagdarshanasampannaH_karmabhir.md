This describes the result of what has been just enjoined.

‘*True insight*’—true knowledge of the Self, just described;
‘*equipped*’ with this,—*i.e*., having obtained direct apprehension of
it.

‘*Is not fettered by acts*’— does not fall into the cycle of births and
deaths; since the past acts have become exhausted on account of their
effects having been already experienced, and no fresh acts are done.

This does not mean that Liberation is attained by mere knowledge.

He who is not endowed with the spiritual insight, taught in the Vedānta,
and who is only given to the performance of acts, falls into the cycle
of births and deaths.—(74)
