The ‘*potsherd*’—the broken jar—shall be his dish and his
begging-bow;—The ‘*roots of trees*’ shall be his home.

‘*Coarse cloth*’—Rough and torn pieces of doth.

‘*Equality*’—towards the friend and the enemy, to one who is neither a
friend nor an enemy, as well as towards himself.

‘*Mark of the liberated person*’. What this means is that to such a man
liberation is quickly attained; not that the man becomes liberated by
these alone.—(44).
