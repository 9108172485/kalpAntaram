Steadiness and the rest are qualities of the Soul.

\(1\) ‘*Steadiness*’—the feeling of contentment even at the loss of
property and such things; expressed by such feelings as ‘if it has been
lost, what does it matter? It can be acquired again.’ Similarly at
separation from a beloved person, the man regains former equanimity by
thinking that ‘such is the way of the world.’

\(2\) ‘*Forgiveness*’— the excusing of wrongs committed; not seeking to
do injury to a person in return for an injury that might have been done
by him.

\(3\) ‘*Self-control*’—absence of haughtiness, renouncing of pride due
to superior learning &c.

\(4\) ‘*Absention from unrighteous appropriation*’:—this is well known.

\(5\) ‘*Purity*’—cleanliness of food etc.

\(6\) ‘*Control of the Sense-organs*’—not allowing them to be drawn even
towards unforbidden things.

\(7\) ‘*Discrimination*’—true knowledge, following upon the refutation
of all doubtful and contrary views.

\(8\) ‘*Knowledge*’ of the Soul. The difference between ‘discrimination’
and ‘knowledge’ is that the former refers to *Acts*, and the latter to
the *Soul*.

In view of this tautology, some people read ‘*Dhīvidyā*’ (wise
discrimination). But this is not right; specially as we have explained
the difference between the two.

The rest are well known.

‘*Absence of anger*’ is not permitting anger to arise when there is an
occasion for it, and ‘*forgiveness*’ is not doing harm to others even
when they may have done harm to one.—(92).
