Those who have taken to the renouncing of the Veda are called
‘*Veda-sanyāsika*,’ ‘renouncers of the Veda.’ The term ‘*veda*’
indicates the renouncing of all such acts as the pouring of libations
and the like, and not that of reciting Vedic texts; then again, as for
meditation on the soul, this has been enjoined for these men also; so
that what are forbidden Cor them are such acts as going on pilgrimages,
keeping of fasts and so forth, all which require (for their
accomplishment) wealth as well as bodily labour; and the prohibition
does not apply to such acts as the twilight-prayer, repeating of mantras
and the like, for which the man needs nothing besides himself. All this
we shall explain at the proper place.

The first half of the verse sums up the section on Renunciation, and the
second half introduces the duties of the ‘renouncer of the Veda.’—(86).
