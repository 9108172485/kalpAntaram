What this verse permits (for the Renunciate) is the mere *reciting* of
the texts, and not the repeating and getting up of them, as is
prescribed for the householder.

‘*Bearing upon sacrifices*’—*i.e*., the Brāhmaṇa texts prescribing the
sacrificial rites.

‘*Dealing with deities*’—those indicating the deities of sacrifices.

A particular kind of texts of this last class is ‘*those dealing with
the Soul*;’—*i*. *e*., ‘*aham manurabhavam* &c,’ ‘*aham rudrebhiḥ*
*etc*.’ and so forth.

*Which have been called ‘Vedānta*’—and which deal with Action and
Knowledge both. This shows that it is the combination of these two that
makes one reach Brahman.—(83)
