If the wife wishes it, then they should go away together; Otherwise he
shall go alone. Others explain the text to mean that if the wife is
still young he shall commit her to his sons, and if she is old, he is to
take her with himself.

It is only when the wife is there that there can be any rule regarding
her either being made over to the sons or going to the forest with her
husband. If the wife has died, then also the man should retire to the
forest, as declared by Āpastamba and others, in connection with the
‘Re-kindling of Fire.’

Only that man can be a Hermit whose senses are not too mobile;
otherwise, he should take another wife; such is the established
rule.—(3).
