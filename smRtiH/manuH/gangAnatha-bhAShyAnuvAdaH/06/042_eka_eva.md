This verse enjoins solitude.

‘*Alone*’—denotes the giving up of past acquaintances.

‘*Without a companion*’:—he shall not take with him even his former
servant &c. It is only in this way that the man becomes free from
friendship, hatred and love; and thus comes to look upon all things as
equal. Otherwise, if a servant happen to be near him, he could have the
notion that—‘this man is *mine*, not that’; and this is the attachment
that becomes the cause of bondage.

When he realises this, then he does not ‘*forsake*’—no son or anybody
else is ever forsaken, by him; and hence he himself also is not
‘*forsaken*’—*not* separated from this son and others; *i.e*., he is not
beset with the pain of separation from them. Otherwise—if there had been
attachment—the giving up would cause great pain. In fact, for auch a man
no one dies, nor does he die for any one.—(42).
