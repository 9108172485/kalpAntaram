If at the stated time he should fail to obtain food, he shall not be
‘*sorry*,’ dejected in mind. He shall not allow grief or joy to overtake
him at failing or succeeding to obtain food.

‘*What suffices to sustain his life*.’—This indicates the quantity of
food to be begged. What this implies is that in the event of his failing
to obtain alms, he shall sustain his life by such fruits, roots and
water as do not belong to another person.

‘*Accessories*’— vessels, staff and so forth;—‘*attachment to
these*’—*i*. *e*., making special efforts to obtain them;—from this he
should he ‘*free*’; that is he shall harbour no longings.—(57)
