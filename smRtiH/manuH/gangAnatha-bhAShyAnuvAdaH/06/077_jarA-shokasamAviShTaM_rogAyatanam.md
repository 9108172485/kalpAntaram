**(verse 6.76)**

This is meant to create disgust.

To say nothing of the bodies of worms insects and fleas, which are born
in the earth and out of moisture etc.,—the human body itself, which has
been considered highly desirable, the likelihood of losing which keeps
man in constant fear,—is like a latrine, the abode of urine and ordure.
It is this latrine-hut that is described.

The *bones* constitute the pillars; the hut is supported by the
bones;—it is tied up with the tendons; it is plastered outside with
flesh and blood;—and it is covered up with the *skin*; or *roofed over*
with the skin;—‘*filled with urine and ordure*’;—the use of the Genitive
here is analogous to that in the expression ‘*odanasya pūrṇaḥ*’, filled
with rice.—(76).

**(verse 6.77)**

^(‘)*Wrinkles*’—indicates a peculiar state of the body in old age, due
to its decrepitude.

‘*Harassed*’—ever beset with diseases.

‘*Sullied with passions*’—*i.e*., harbouring desires, the non-fulfilment
of which brings irremediable unbearable pain.

Realising all this the man ‘*shall discard*’ this body, which is the
abode of ‘*material substances*’—the products of the Earth, in the form
of fat, marrow, phlegm, urine, semen and blood;—it cannot be the abode
of the *Soul*; because this is all-pervading. For all these reasons one
should not cherish any affection for the body.—(77.)
