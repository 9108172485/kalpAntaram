‘*Bhaumāni Kavakāni*’.—The term ‘*kavaka*’ has already been explained
(under 5.5) as a synonym of ‘*chatraka*’ (mushrooms). These mushrooms
grow on the ground, as also in the hollow of trees and other places.
Hence the specification ‘land-grown’.

This however would appear to be contrary to usage; specially as among
the duties of the Householder, all kinds of mushroom have been
forbidden, and for the Hermit, the discipline, if anything, should be
stricter.

For this reason the term ‘*bhaumāni*’ should be taken separately by
itself; and it should be understood us standing for the ‘*gojihvikā*’
(cabbage), which is well-known among foresters,—and not for *anything
grown on the land*.

Mushrooms having been already forbidden before, their repented
prohibition in the present text is for the purpose of indicating that
the eating of the fragrant grass and other things involves the same
Expiatory Rite as that of mushrooms.

‘*Bhustṛṇa*’ (fragrant grass) and ‘*shigruka*’ (pot-herb) are the names
of particular kinds of herbs well known among cultivators—(14).
