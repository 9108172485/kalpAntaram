The term ‘*gṛhāśrama*’ means that ‘*āśrama*’, *life-stage* which is
characterised by the ‘*gṛha*’, *house*,—*i.e*., the *presence of the
wife*.

Having ‘*lived*’ there,—*i.e*., having duly fulfilled the duties of that
stage of life—he should dwell in, the forest. This is the injunction
here set forth.

The affix in ‘*sthitvā*’, ‘having lived’, indicates the priority of the
Householder’s life to that of the Hermit; and the meaning is that one
should proceed from, stage to stage in the right order; it is only one
who has lived the Householder’s life that is entitled to the forest-life
of the Hermit.

What is said here is in accordance with the view that a man should pass
through each and all the four stages. There is however the other view
that from the life of the purely celebate student also one can proceed
at once to the forest-life; as is going to be described later on.

‘*With* *his* *organs under subjection* ’—with his impurities washed
off, his passions calmed down.

The phrases ‘*according to law*’ and ‘*in the proper manner*’ have been
added only for the purpose of filling up the metre; as we have already
explained in several places.

All that is meant to be enjoined here is that ‘having completed the
Householder’s life, he shall betake himself to the life in the
forest.’—(1).
