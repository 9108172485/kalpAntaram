Disturbance of the mind caused by pleasure and pain, and appearing in
the forms of joy and sorrow, should be got rid of in the following
manner. \[He shall cultivate the following idea\]—‘When such and such a
person does anything pleasing to me, it is the result of some good act
that I may have done in the past; and the doer of the act has not done
it. through any feelings of affection towards me; in fact he could not
do anything inimical to me; and when some one does what is disagreeable
to me, there also what is the source of my pain is only my own evil act
this is what he shall ponder over while practising meditation; so that
he does not feel any attraction towards the man who does what is
agreeable to him, nor any repulsion towards one who does what is
disagreeable to him.

By doing thus ‘*he reaches the eternal Brahman*’, directly, and has not
got to pass through the intervening stages of the Luminous Path and so
forth.

The presence of the epithet ‘*eternal*’ implies that the man does not
return to the cycle of births and deaths.—(79)
