‘*Adorned*’—with flowers, bracelets and other ornaments.

‘*Duty*’—all that has been prescribed for the Renunciate, such as
meditation on the Self and so forth, he shall perform with care. In fact
one should perform the duties of that order to which he may belong.

One should not consider himself to have become a ‘Renunciate’ merely by
wearing such external marks as the ‘three staffs’ and the like; in fact
‘*he should be equal, to all beings*’;—that is, he should, with care,
eschew all love, hatred and greed.

By deprecating the external marks it is not meant that the man should
wear ornaments.—(66)
