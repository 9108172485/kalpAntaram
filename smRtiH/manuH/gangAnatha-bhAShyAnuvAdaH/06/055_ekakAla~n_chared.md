What is laid down here is that the man shall *eat once*, this being the
purpose of the alms; it does not mean that he shall go to beg only once.
What is intended here is the prohibition of eating twice; that is, the
man, having gone for alms once, shall not save out of it for eating
again. It is with a view to this that we have the prohibition *of
eating*. It is for this reason that the text adds ‘*he shall not seek
for a large quantity*;’ *Seeking for a large quantity* can only be for
the purpose of eating again and again; specially because for one who
delights in solitude, large quantities of food would not be wanted for
the sake of servants and other dependents. By supplying a reason for
what is laid down, the text implies that even at a single meal the man
shall not eat too much.—(55)
