The food that has been described above, he should obtain day after day,
just enough to serve for the day.

The man who has a collection that lasts for one month. The form is
obtained by the adding of the affix ‘*ṭhan*’. Or the reading may be
‘*māsasañcayakaḥ*’ and the word explained as a *Bahuvrīhi* compound: ‘he
whose collection is sufficient for a month’.

Similarly with the last two expressions.—(18).
