This verse eulogises the fourth life-stage at the expense of the
Householding stage.

At sacrifices animals are killed; the cutting of herbs and grasses also
constitutes ‘killing’, according to the theory that ‘all that grows is
animate’. It is this that constitutes the ‘fear’ of living beings. So
that when one has gone away from home, and has disposed of the Fires,
there is no such fear from him. This is what is meant by the
words—‘*having granted freedom from fear to all beings*.’ This also
indicates that the Renunciate shall not pick up for his use any inch
leaves or twigs as have not quite dried up.

‘*Of light*’—ever effulgent; where the rising and s etting of the sun
are not perceived; this is what is described by the words of the
Upaniṣads—^(‘)Beyond this the sun does not rise or set’—(39).
