The Accusative ending is due to the verse being construed along with the
verb ‘should reflect’ (of the preceding verse.)

‘*Loved ones*’—sons and other relations.

‘*Separation*’—caused by their untimely death.

‘*Hated persons*’—Enemies.

‘*Meeting*’—in battle &c.

‘*Decrepitude*.’—‘Decrepitude’ is a peculiar state of the body during
the fourth quarter of man’s age.—‘*Being beset* having the shape of the
body spoilt, feebleness, weakness of the senses, the advent of asthma
and other diseases, being loved by none, being jeered at by all;—all
this constitutes being ‘beset with decrepitude.’

‘*Diseases*’— even before the advent of old age, some people are
attacked by diseases.—(62)
