‘*Spirituality*’— disposition to concentrate one’s attention upon the
quest for the true nature of the self;—‘*centered*’— always thinking of
it, he shall remain.

‘*Disintrested*;’—this re-iterates what has been already said before
regarding his not caring for the due fulfilment of *Dharma* and other
things.

‘*Nirāmiṣaḥ*’—free from longings. Flesh is ‘*āmiṣa*’, which indicates
(figuratively) *longing*, by reason of the fact that living beings have
a great liking for flesh; and this longing is forbidden.

All the rest has already been explained before.—(49).
