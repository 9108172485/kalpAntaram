When one speaks in a manner contrary to the scriptures, his words are
called ‘*improper*’—*i.e*. hard, disagreeable taunts;—these he shall
‘*bear patiently*’—*i.e*. tolerate, not answer back. In fact, he shall
not bear ill-will even in his mind; what is implied by the direction is
that ‘on being cursed he shall pronounce a blessing,” which forbids even
mental perturbation; and it does not mean that he shall actually ask the
man—‘is it well with you?’ Because if he spoke thus (and bore anger in
his mind) he would be a liar, saying one thing and thinking of another.

‘*He* *shall* *not* *insult*’—shall not show disrespect towards—any one.
That is, he shall not omit to show respect to his elders.

‘*For the sake of his present body*;’—*i.e*. if some one were to strike
his body—‘he shall not make enmity with him.’ He is to think all the
time in the following strain—? what would it matter whether this body
perished or not, I may have an effulgent body.’—(47).
