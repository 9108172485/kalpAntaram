The duties laid down in the Veda are—(a) the *Śrauta* sacrifices,
*Darśapūrṇamāsa* and the rest and (b) the *Smārta* rites of the Twilight
Prayers and the rest. These latter also are regarded as ‘laid down in
the Veda,’ because *Smṛtis* have their source in the Veda.

‘*The observances of the Accomplished Student*’—*e.g*., ‘He shall not
wear over-worn or dirty clothes’ and so forth.

If these are omitted, the offender should fast for one day.

In connection with the omission of the *Śrauta* rites, some sacrifices
have been prescribed by way of expiation; and with these the ‘fasting’
here prescribed is to be combined.
