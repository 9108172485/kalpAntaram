‘*Thrice in the day*’—*i.e*., at the time of the three ‘extractions’; as
laid down by Gautama (26.10)—‘water shall be touched at each
extraction.’

During the night also, he shall bathe at the three ‘watches,’—leaving
off the midnight one; as this last would not be a proper time for
bathing.

‘*The clothes*’ along with which the man is to bathe should be the two
pieces that one wears ordinarily as a matter of necessity.

‘*Enter water*.’—This implies that the bathing is not to be done with
water drawn from the well or tank.

‘*With women*’—even of the Brāhmaṇa caste—‘*he shall not
converse*’;—except with his mother, elder sister and other elderly
relations. Conversation with one’s wife on business-matters is not
forbidden; but other kinds of conversation should not be carried
on.—(223)
