‘*Person keeping a vow*’—*i.e*., one who is still in the stage of the
Religious Student.

‘*In any way*’—*i.e*., even in normal times; in abnormal times, when
life is in danger, the eating of the two things has been permitted; so
that there being nothing wrong in such eating, the present verse cannot
he taken as laying down as an expiation for the same, thereby
contradicting what has gone before. Hence what the meaning is that the
expiation is necessary only under certain conditions, not always.

‘*Original Kṛcchra*’—*i.e*., the *Prājāpatya*; which is called
‘original,’ because it forms the *origin* or *archetype* of all
*Kṛcchras*.

‘*He should complete the remainder of his vow*’—This shows that until
the prescribed expiation has been performed, the man is not entitled to
complete the vow.—(158)
