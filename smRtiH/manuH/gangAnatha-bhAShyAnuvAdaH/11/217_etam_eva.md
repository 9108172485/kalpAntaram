In the ‘*Yavamadhyama*’ the man shall fast on the New-moon day and then
take one morsel on the first (of the bright half), two on the second,
and so on, till fifteen are taken on the Full-moon day; then beginning
with the first of the dark half of the month, he shall reduce it by one
morsel daily, till there is fasting again on the New-moon day.—(217)
