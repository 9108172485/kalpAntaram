A sacrifice is regarded as ‘*with small fees*’ when the fee given at it
is smaller than what has been prescribed.

“The fee is a sort of *hire*; if a worker is obtained at a lower hire,
why should anything higher be paid? This is the principle that governs
all dealings of people in the ordinary world, with the ploughman and
other workers. There is the saying also—‘when a thing can be had for one
*paṇa*, what wise men shall buy it for ten paṇas?’ If the sacred texts
prescribe ‘twelve-hundred’ as the fee, this is done only with a view to
the obtaining of higher rewards.”

It is people entertaining such notions for whose sake the present text
sets forth the prohibition, and it does not refer to a case where the
prescribed fee itself is *small*.—(39)
