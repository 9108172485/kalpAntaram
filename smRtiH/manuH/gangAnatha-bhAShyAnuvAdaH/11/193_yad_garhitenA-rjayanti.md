‘*Objectionable*’— Though the text uses this general term, it should be
understood as standing for the ‘accepting of improper gifts,’ because
what the next verse lays down refers to the particular means of
acquiring property; what is said is that ‘the man becomes absolved from
the sin of accepting an improper gift.’

‘*Giving it up*’—Relinquishing; renouncing all sense of ownership with
regard to it, or actually giving it away. Unmindful of any spiritual or
temporal benefits that might accrue from the relinquishment, he should
deposit, the property on the public road, saying—‘anyone who wishes may
take this from me’;—or he may throw it away into a river or a pit. or in
some such place.

The exact forms of the ‘repeating of sacred texts’ and ‘austerities’ are
going to be described in the verse referred to above.

Others lead ‘*mānavāḥ*’ (‘men’) in place of ‘*Brāhmaṇāḥ*,’ and explain
the verse as follows:—Any means of acquiring property that has been
forbidden for a man—be he a twice-born or Śūdra—is ‘*objectionable*’ for
him. *E.g*., it has been declared that—‘The Brāhmaṇa or the Kṣatriya
shall not take interest’
([10.117]).
For one who earns wealth by such means, the expiation consists of
‘giving up,’ ‘repeating of texts’ and ‘austerities,’ all three combined.
In the ease of the Brāhmaṇa accepting an improper gift, however, there
is a special expiation as described in the following verse.—(193)
