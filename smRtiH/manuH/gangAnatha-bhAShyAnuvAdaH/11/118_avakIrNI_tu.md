‘*Avakīrṇa*’ means the breaking, by the Religious Student, of the vow of
celibacy,—*i.e*., sexual intercourse, an ‘immorality’; one who has done
this is ‘*avakīrṇī*,’ ‘the immoral religious student’

This is going to be described (under 120) as—‘the intentional emission
of semen.’

‘*One-eyed ass*’—This lays down the material to be used at the
sacrifice, along with its qualification.

‘*On the cross-way*.’—This lays down the place of the sacrifice.

‘*At night*.’—This lays down the time of the sacrifice.

‘*To Nirṛti*.’—This lays down the deity of the sacrifice.

‘*In* *the manner of the Pākayajña*.’—This prescribes the procedure to
be adopted at the sacrifice.

“As a matter of fact all *animal-sacrifices* have for their archetype
the *Agniṣṭoma*; as is clear from the fact that they can only be
accomplished by means of the animal-sacrifices at this latter
sacrifice—\[so that the said sacrifice of the ass must follow the
procedure of the Agnistoma, and not of the Pākayajña.\]”

True; but the same Agniṣṭoma is the archetype of the ‘Pākayajña’ also;
and it can be performed only when the agent is prompted by the desire
for those rewards that follow from that sacrifice. Then again, it has
been declared that ‘the animal also *flows*, and milk also flows’ \[so
that there is a distinct similarity between the Animal Sacrifice and the
Pākayajña offerings of milk\].

‘*Pākayajña*’— is a name applied to the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* and other
similar sacrifices.—(118)
