After the Brāhmaṇas have been apprized of it, the offender shall make
his guilt known to others also; this would be ‘*confession*.’

‘*Repentance*’— dejection of mind, finding expression in some such
feeling as—‘Woe to me that I committed such a misdeed! Useless has been
my sinner’s life’! and so forth.

‘*Study*’ here stands for the repealing of the *Sāvitrī*, or the
reciting of the Veda, in cases other than those of injury to living
creatures.

When a man is unable to perforin the austerity, there shall
be^(‘)*gifts*.’ This is what is meant by the assertion—‘*as also by
gifts in cases of difficulty*’; which means that when the austerity
causes great pain, the man may have recourse to gifts.’—(227)
