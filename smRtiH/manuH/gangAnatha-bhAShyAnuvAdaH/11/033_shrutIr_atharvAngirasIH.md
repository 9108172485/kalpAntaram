This verse is for the purpose of removing doubts as to what constitutes
the ‘power’ of the Brāhmaṇa.

‘*Śruti*’ is what is *heard*. The meaning is that he should employ those
malevolent rites that are found revealed in the Atharva-Veda. This
particular Veda has been mentioned because it abounds in injunctions of
malevolent spells,—which also are not such as have been actually
forbidden by the other Vedas.

Or, the term ‘*atharvāṅgirasī*’ may be taken as standing for all those
sacred texts that deal with malevolent rites.

Or, the term ‘*Atharva*’ itself may be taken as standing for the rites
themselves; as we find it used in such passages.as—‘the *Atharvana* is
the name of that sacrifice which is performed with a view to a definite
desirable result.’—(33)
