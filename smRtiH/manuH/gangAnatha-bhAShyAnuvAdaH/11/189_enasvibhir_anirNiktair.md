‘*Sinners*’—This stands for the ‘*outcasts*,’ as is dear from the
context So long as these are ‘*unexpiated*’—undean, not having performed
the prescribed expiations,—‘*one shall not carry on any business*,’—such
as borrowing, selling, buying, sacrificing and so forth.

‘*Expiation*’ is *purification*, wiping off of the sin. When this has
been done, one should not ‘*despise*’ the man. That is, no one should
reproach one who has duly performed the prescribed expiation.—(189)
