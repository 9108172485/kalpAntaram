This forbids the act of begging for the purpose of marrying more than
one wife merely through lust.

‘*Sexual enjoyment is the only fruit*’—This is purely declamatory, and
should not be understood in its literal sense.

Others explain the text to mean that ‘gifts for marriage shall be given
to one who is going to marry for the purpose of obtaining children, and
*not* to one who is going to do it merely through lust’;—this same idea
being stated in the text in a somewhat different form—‘gifts shall be
given to one who is seeking for offspring,—the person mentioned in the
text is seeking sexual enjoyment, and not offspring.’

‘*The issue belongs to the person who gave the wealth*,’—and not to the
man who marries.—(5)
