It has been declared in the *Smṛtis* that sins committed by thought,
word and deed are wiped off by the repeating of sacred texts and the
offering of *Homa*; from which it might be assumed that these are beyond
the scope of Austerities. It is in view of such an assumption that the
text proceeds to add this verse;—the sense being that the said sins also
are wiped off by Austerities.—(241)
