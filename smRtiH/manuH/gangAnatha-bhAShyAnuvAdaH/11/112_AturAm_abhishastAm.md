‘*Threatened*’—caught up—‘*by danger*’ proceeding ‘*from thieves, tigers
and the like*.’

‘*Sarvaprāṇaiḥ*’—with all his strength. The word ‘*prāṇa*’ does not

and ‘*mahāprāṇa*’ in the sense of *weak* and *strong* respectively.
Thus, when he is unable, by himself, to rescue her, he should bring
about bur rescue with the help of other men.—(112)
