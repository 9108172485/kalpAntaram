‘*Tumbling on unclean things*’ is purely declamatory, like the mention
of ‘the eating of the food of the gods.’

“How can the reciting of Vedic texts ever be an *improper act?*”

The answer to this is that what is meant is that ‘he might do an act
which is improper,’ as compared to the reciting of the Veda. Further,
why is it impossible for the reciting of Veda to be ‘improper?’ In fact
the uttering of Vedic texts has been clearly forbidden for one who is in
an unclean condition.—(96)
