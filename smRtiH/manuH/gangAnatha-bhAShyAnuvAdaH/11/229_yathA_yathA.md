The ‘*body*’ here stands for the *inner soul*, and not for the material
body, as it is the former that forms the receptacle of virtue and sin.
The term ‘*body*’ therefore should be understood as used figuratively
for the *soul*.

This is a declamatory passage in support of the injunction of
‘Repentance.’

The meaning of ‘*loathing*’ is well-known.—(229)
