Some people take the ‘repentance’ to extend up to the term
‘renunciation.’ But this is not light; as ‘*repentance*’ consists in
*mental depression*, while ‘*renunciation*’ is in the form of the
resolution ‘such an act shall not be done again’; and that the two are
distinct acts is shown by the past-participial affix ‘*ktvā*’ in
‘*santapya*’—‘after one has repented, then comes the *renunciation*.’

Thus then the sense is—‘Like the expiation, the sinner should also do
(a) the confession, (b) the repentance and the renunciation.

‘*Becomes purified*’—obtains success.—(230)
