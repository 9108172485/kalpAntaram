The meaning of this verse has been already explained before.

When a Brāhmaṇa is performing a malevolent rite, the King shall not
utter any such ‘*unpleasant words*’ as ‘punish him.’

‘*He shall not we harsh words*.’—This prohibition refers also to
remonstrance and censure.

Or, the meaning may be that—‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not be ill-treated by
men of any caste; since he is very powerful, by reason of his knowledge
of the Vedas, and is capable of inflicting punishments by himself.’

‘*Creator*’—of another King.

‘*Punisher*’—chastiser.

‘*Advisor*’—one who offers beneficial advice.

And since he is all this, he is a ‘*benefactor*.’

Thus, being endowed with all kinds of power, he should not be
disregarded as a weakling.—(35)
