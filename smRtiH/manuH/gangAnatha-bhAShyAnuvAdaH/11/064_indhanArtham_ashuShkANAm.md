There would be nothing wrong in the cutting down of trees for purposes
of fuel for sacrificial performances; specially as one cannot, be sure
of the purity of dead trees.

‘*Undertaking of the act*’—of cooking. There is the prohibition that,
even when distressed by hunger, one shall not. do the cooking for
himself alone; and it is for this reason that we explain the term ‘act’
to mean the *act of cooking*. If, on the other hand, we took the term to
stand for *action in general*, then it would be necessary to assume the
necessary prohibition of such action in general, merely on the strength
of the fact that an expiation is laid down for it; as there could be no
expiation for an act that, is not prohibited; as it has been declared
that ‘by doing what is forbidden one becomes liable to expiatory rites’
(44). When, however, we take the word to mean as explained above, then
the expiation laid down is quite in keeping with a well-known
prohibition, and there is no need for assuming one.

‘*Eating forbidden food*.’—*Objection*.—“The Eating of Forbidden Food
having been already mentioned above (57), why should there be a
repetition of it here?”

*Answer*.—It has been mentioned again for the purpose of indicating an
alternative Expiation;—the sense being that the expiation prescribed
before is for repeated acts of eating forbidden food; while the one
indicated by the present text is for doing it for the first time.—(64)
