This declaration has been made for the purpose of indicating that in
cases of intentional offence, the Expiatory Rite should be of a
particularly serious character.

‘*Committed unintentionally*.’—They declare that Expiatory Rites are
meant, to be performed in cases where the ‘*sin*’—the transgression of
the ordinances—has been committed through negligence or want of care.

“What are the grounds for such an opinion? The law on the point is
that—‘when a man transgresses an injunction and undertakes a wrong act,
he shall perform an expiatory rite.’ So that there is no ground for any
differentiation.”

Some people hold that if there were no such differentiation, there would
be no point in the prescribing of special Expiatory Ṛtes for cases of
intentional offence.

It is for this reason that the text puts forward another view, by way of
a ‘*Pūrvapakṣa*’ a ‘contrary view’—‘They apply to cases of *intentional
offence also*.’ According to this view the meaning of the Law would be
that Expiatory Rites shall be performed in cases of *intentional* as
well as *unintentional* offences.

‘*On the evidence of Śruti texts*’—One Vedic text indicative of the said
view is found in the *Upahavya-Brāhmaṇa* (the story of Upahavya)—‘Indra
gave away the ascetics to the dogs.’ Such giving away could never have
been *unintentional*; and yet the story goes on to say, it was for the
purpose of expiating this sin that Prajāpati made over Upahavya to
Indra. Such is the clear meaning of the text—(45)
