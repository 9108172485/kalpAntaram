The expiation here laid down pertains to giving false evidence in
connection with gold, land and such things, or in cases of doubt
regarding a murder. The guilt in these cases is very much heavier; and
in regard to other expiations laid down elsewhere, the adoption of one
or the other should be determined in accordance with the gravity or
otherwise of the

‘*Angering*.’—This is the same as what has been spoken of as ‘falsely
harassing’ under 56 above; as ‘harassment’ is always preceded by
‘angering.’

‘*Trust*.’—In this case also the exact nature of the expiation shall
depend upon such considerations as to whether the trust-property belongs
to a poor or to a rich person, to a low person or to a Brāhmaṇa, or to
some other person of high position. In a case where only one expiation
is mentioned, it can be one only; and there can be no occasion for any
assumptions. In fact, in connection with giving false evidence and
‘misappropriating a trust’ there are no varying grades of expiation.

What is prescribed in connection with ‘wine-drinking’ is certainly
somewhat heavier; but every case is to be determined in accordance with
‘the capacity etc.,’ of the guilty person (11.209); though these
considerations have been laid down only as affecting those offences ‘for
the expiation whereof no atonement has been prescribed’ (209).—(88)
