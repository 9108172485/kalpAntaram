This is the expiation for stealing gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa.

The term ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ is meant to include all castes; as is dear from
the fact that no other expiation has been prescribed for the Kṣatriya
and other castes.

‘*Punish me*.’—‘Inflict the proper punishment on me.’ The man shall go
to the King and tell him this.

The word ‘*King*’ here stands for the Sovereign of the country,—but one
who is of the Kṣatriya caste.—(99)
