‘*Some trifle*’ stands for a small thing—small in amount, in utility and
in price.

According to the older writers the expiation here laid down is for the
killing of a *single* animal.

‘*Control of Breath*’ here stands for *self-control*.

The killing of ‘insects and worms,’ which has been mentioned among
‘defiling sins’ (under 11.70), is to be understood as referring to
insects of large size,—the present verse referring to little insects as
mosquitoes and the rest.—(141)
