‘*Who follow improper occupations*’;—*e.g*., Brāhmaṇas engaged in the
service of a Śūdra. The *proper occupation* for each man is indicated by
the livelihood that has been prescribed for him; occupations other than
that would he ‘*improper*.’ That occupation which is prescribed for
twice-born men would be ‘*improper*’ for persons other than twice-born.

‘*Abandoned by the Veda*’— those who, though *initiated*, have not
studied the Veda,—or having studied have forgotten it.

For those also there should be the ‘*three Kṛcchras*.’

‘*Are desirous of performing* *expiations*.’—This is purely reiterative;
as people take to an action only when they have a desire for it.—(192)
