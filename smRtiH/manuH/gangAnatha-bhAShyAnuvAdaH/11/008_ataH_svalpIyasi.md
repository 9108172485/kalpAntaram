‘*His own people*’—Servants, councillors, mother, son, wife and so
forth;—while these ‘*are living in distress*,’—if the man ‘*gives to
other people*’—for the purpose of acquiring fame,—this form would be
like ‘*swallowing poison*,’—‘*which is sweet in the beginning*.’ The
swallowing of poison, though apparently sweet in the beginning, leads to
disastrous results, in the shape of death; exactly like that is the
giving of gifts just described.

This same idea is otherwise expressed by calling the act ‘*counterfeit
virtue*.’ It has the semblance of virtue and is not real virtue; just as
the shell is *like silver*, not silver itself.—(8)
