What, the text means is that so long as the mind is not satisfied, one
may go on doing even more penances than what has been actually
prescribed.

When a misdeed has been committed, if there is in the mind a certain
‘*uneasiness*’—an uncomfortable feeling,—then, even though the
prescribed expiation may have been performed, it should be repeated,
till peace of mind has been secured.

The term ‘*penance*’ here stands for *gifts* and other prescribed, acts
also.—(233)
