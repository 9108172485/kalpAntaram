This is a declamatory passage in support of the injunction of
Confession.

In the expression ‘*naro-dharmam*,’ an ‘a’ is to be understood between
the two words. As the proclaiming of one’s own righteous deeds has been
forbidden—‘one should not proclaim his own good qualities’; while it is
‘*adharma*,’ ‘*sin*,’ that forms the subject-matter of the context; and
the text itself in the second half has the term ‘*adharmeṇa*.’— (228)
