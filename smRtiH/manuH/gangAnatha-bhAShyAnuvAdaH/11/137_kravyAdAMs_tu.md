‘*Carnivorous animals*’—*e.g*., the hyena, the lion and so forth.

‘*Not carnivorous*’—*e.g*., the several species of the deer.

‘*Dhenu*’—stands for the *cow* only.

‘*Kṛṣṇala*’— is a gold-piece of a definite weight. The term has this
technical meaning in treatises on Fines; but

elsewhere it is used in the ordinary sense of a particular
weight-measure; as in such passages as—‘one desiring longevity should
give one hundred *kṛṣṇalas* of clarified butter.’—(137)
