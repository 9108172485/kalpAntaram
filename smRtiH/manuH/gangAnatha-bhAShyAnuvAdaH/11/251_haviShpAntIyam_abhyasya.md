‘*Itīti*’—the first ‘*iti*’ is the opening word of the text referred to,
and the second ‘*iti*’ is meant to show that the former is the opening
word of a text;—and it serves to show that a different text is meant.
Thus it is that we get at the indication of a particular sacred text.

‘*Pauruṣa-Sūkta*’—is the hymn consisting of sixteen verses, beginning
with the word ‘*sahasraśīrṣā*.’—(251)
