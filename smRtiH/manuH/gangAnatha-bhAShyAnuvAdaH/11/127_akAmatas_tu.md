This is another expiation in the form of gifts. It is going to be laid
down (under 139) below that so long as one has wealth, he need not

‘*Unintentionally*.’— No stress is meant to be laid on this
qualification; as is clear from the heaviness of the expiation. Or, it
may be assumed that it refers to the unintentional killing of the
*Kṣatriya* or the Vaiśya, engaged in a sacrificial performance.

‘*Vṛṣabhaikasahasrāḥ gāḥ*’—literally means ‘thousand cows who have one
bull among them.’—(127)
