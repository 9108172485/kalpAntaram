‘*Refugee*’—He who, on being harassed by his enemies, or struck by some
powerful person, seeks refuge with a person saying ‘save me,’—or a man
who has committed an offence and comes to a learned man saying—‘save me,
tell me what expiation I should perform.’ Both these would be
‘refugees.’

‘*Ungrateful men*’—Those who forget the benefit that has been conferred
upon them by some one, and try to injure him,—or one who spoils the
effect of the benefit he has himself conferred upon some one, and tries
to undo it by doing him harm. Though both these men would be
‘*kṛtaghna*’ in the literal sense, yet in ordinary usage the name is
applied to one who causes injury to his benefactor.

In this connection, there is no consideration of caste,—the only
condition is that the persons murdered are^(‘)children’ and the like.

‘*Women*’—Even though they be unchaste. Though in these cases the
expiation shall be light, yet association with them is directly
forbidden by the words of the text.

‘*Association*’—Keeping company, living together.—(190)
