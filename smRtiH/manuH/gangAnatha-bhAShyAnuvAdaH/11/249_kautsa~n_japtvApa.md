The ‘*Kautsa hymn*’ is that which was revealed to, and given out by, the
sage Kutsa,—the eight verses beginning with ‘*Ap naḥ shoshuchadadham,
etc*.,’ found in the *Ṛgveda* (1.97.1).

‘*The Vāsiṣṭha hymn consisting of the triad of verses beginning with*
“*Prati*.”’—The group of three verses, ‘*prati*’ being the opening word
of the hymn.—‘*Pratistomebhirupasaṃvasiṣṭhāḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda, 7.80.1).

‘*Māhitra hymn*’—that revealed to the *Mahitṛs*,—this also consists of
three verses, and contains the term ‘*Mahitṛ*’ (Ṛgveda, 10.185.1).

Some people read ‘*Mahendram*’ (for ‘*Māhitram*’); and this would mean
the forty-eight verses ‘*Mahān Indra ojase*, etc. etc.’ (Ṛgveda,
8.8.1),—which is also called the ‘*Payḥ-Sūkta*.’

‘*Śuddhavati verses*’—‘*Eto indrastavāṃśudhim śuddhena*, etc.’ (Ṛgveda,
8.95.7).

Here also the term ‘*Even*’ is meant to include sins similar to the one
mentioned.—(249)
