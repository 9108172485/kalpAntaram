This verse lays down how his relations shall treat the outcast after the
‘water’ has been offered.

‘*Conversation*’—Talking with one another.

‘*Property*’—Wealth. This also shall not be given to him.

‘*Ordinary intercourse*’—Saluting at meeting and enquiring after health
and so forth, bringing him home at marriages and other ceremonies,
feeding him, and so forth.

“The cessation of all this is already implied in that of
*conversation*.”

What is meant by the last phrase includes also the dropping of all such
courtesies as rising to receive him, leaving the seat and the likes;
while ‘conversation’ stands for acts pertaining to the utterance of
words only.—(184)
