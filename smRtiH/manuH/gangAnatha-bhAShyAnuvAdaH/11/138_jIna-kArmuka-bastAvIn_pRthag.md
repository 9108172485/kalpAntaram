‘*Inconstant*.’—Those women who, behaving like prostitutes, have
intercourse with many men, are called ‘inconstant’; the epithet does not
connote merely transgression of the scriptures; as that would not
restrict the term to *adultery* only.

One should give the ‘leathern bag’ and other things in the order of the
castes.

‘*Jina*’—the leathern bag, used for carrying water and such purposes.

‘*Kārmuka*’—bow.

‘*Vaṣṭa*’—goat.

‘*Avi*’—sheep.

‘*Respectively*.’—This shows that the expiation here laid down is not to
be regarded as cumulative.

Some people read ‘*gatvā*’ (for ‘*hatvā*’) (‘having intercourse’). But
this is not right; since ‘killing’ forms the subject-matter of the
present context.—(138)
