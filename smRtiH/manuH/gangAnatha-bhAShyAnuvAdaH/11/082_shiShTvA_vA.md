This text sets forth the last alternative.

‘*Having confessed his guilt*,’ his offence—‘before the Congregation *of
the Gods of Earth*—Brāhmaṇas—‘*and the Gods of men*’—Kṣatriyas;—the
‘Brāhmaṇa’ meant here are the *priests* officiating at a sacrifice, and
the ‘*Kṣatriya*’ for the *sacrificer*.—Having done this, ‘*if he bathes
at the Final Bath of the Horse-sacrifice*’ that has been performed,—‘*he
becomes absolved*.’

Some people think that, inasmuch as the treatment of the ‘Twelve-year
penance’ has been finished, what is set forth in the present verse is a
distinct alternative to it.

Others, however, hold that, inasmuch as alternatives have already been
mentioned in the course of the description of the Twelve-year Penance
itself, the present verse must be taken as laying down the final point
of that same penance,—just in the same way as ‘dying for the sake of the
cow or the Brāhmaṇa’ has been laid down;—this final point resembling the
‘rising’ either after the performance of the ‘Sārasvata’ sacrifice, or
on reaching a water-fall.

Our view, however, is that—(1) since the former penance has already been
summed up, the present one may be taken as a distinct alternative, while
(2) on account of its occurring in the middle of the treatment of the
former penance, it may be taken as forming part of it So that it may be
taken as both,—it being efficacious when performed along with the
Twelve-year Penance, as also when performed by itself alone, according
to the circumstances attending each case.—(82)
