This expiation refers to the drinking of water out of a vessel in which
the taste of wine is felt.

“The term ‘*madya*,’ ‘intoxicating drink,’ being a general one, all that
is intended would be secured from the single word ‘*contained in a pot
used far keeping intoxicating drinks*’; and the other word ‘*contained
in a vessel used for keeping nine*’ should not have been used.”

True; this would be so if there were not a great difference between the
expiations prescribed for the drinking of ‘wine’ and of ‘intoxicating
drinks.’ When, however, there *is* such a difference, it would appear
that, there should be a correspondingly heavier expiation for the
drinking of water contained in a *wine-vessel*;—and it is with a view to
preclude this idea that the text prescribes the same expiation for both.

‘*For five days he shall drink milk in which Śaṅkha-puṣpī has been
boiled*.’ The term ‘*payas*’ here stands for *milk*; because the
particular term ‘*śhṛta*’ (in the sense of *boiled*) is used only in
connection with *milk* and sacrificial materials.

‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is the name of a medicinal herb; and this shall be
pounded and boiled in milk, which shall be drunk for five days.—(147)
