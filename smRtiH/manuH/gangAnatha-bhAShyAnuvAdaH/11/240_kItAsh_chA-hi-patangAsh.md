This is a praise of Austerity.

By the force of austerity, beings go everywhere, reaching Heaven
itself;—even such naturally incapable beings as *Insects* and the rest
go to heaven by the form of austerity;—what of learned Brāhnmṇas?

What forms the basis of this assertion is the fact that the suffering
that, these insects and other beings experience by the very nature of
their existence is the ‘austerity’ in their case; and when they have
thereby destroyed their sins (on account of which they were born as
insects, etc.) they go forward to heaven to which they are entitled by
their good deeds in the past—(240)
