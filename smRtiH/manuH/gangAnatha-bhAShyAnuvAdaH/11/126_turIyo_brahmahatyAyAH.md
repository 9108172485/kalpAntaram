It has been said above that for the killing of a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya,
engaged in a sacrificial performance, the expiation shall be equal to
that for killing a Brāhmaṇa. The present verse applies to cases other
than these.

The ‘*fourth*’ and ‘*eighth*’ parts (of the expiation for killing a
Brāhmaṇa) have been prescribed in connection with such persons as are
fulfilling all their duties,—the term ‘*duty*’ standing for *all
duties*.

According to this rule, for the killing of a Kṣatriya, the expiation
shall last for *three years*, for that of a Vaiśya, for a *year and a
half*, and for that of a Śūdra, for *nine months*.

The expiation that has been laid down above (under 67) in connection
with ‘the killing of a woman, a Vaiśya or a Kṣatriya,’ pertains to the
case of those persons being such as have neglected their duties, and are
addicted to unrighteous acts.

‘*Duty*’ implies character. When the Vaiśya is one who has the character
of, and behaves like, a Vaiśya. The ‘duty’ of the Śūdra consists in
service of twice-born men and the like,—and not the performance of the
‘great sacrifices.’

The full expiation prescribed is to be performed in the case of the
death of persons firmly devoted to the performance of their
duties.—(126)
