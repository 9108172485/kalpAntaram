‘*Breath*’—is air moving along the mouth and the nostrils,—its
‘*suppression*’ means its *suspension* and it is known as standing for
the control of the air moving outwards, as also that proceeding inward.

‘*Vyāhṛtis*’—the seven syllables (‘*bhūḥ*’ and the rest).

‘*Praṇava*’—the syllable ‘*Om*.’

What the verse means is that ‘one shall perform the breath-suppressions
with the *Vyāhṛtis* and the *Praṇava*.’

‘*Sixteen*’—is the number of repetitions of the act.

“What sort of association is there (between the breath-suspension and
the syllables)?”

Some people say that what is meant is that ‘after each suppression of
breath, the Vyāhṛtis and the Praṇava should be repeated.’

Others declare that the syllable should be meditated upon during the
time that the breath is suppressed.

“What is the time for each breath-suppression?”

It shall be continued so long as the suppression of breath does not
begin to be painful.

‘*Breath-suppression*’ stands for what has been described under the
names ‘*Kumbhaka*,’ ‘*Pūraka*’ and ‘*Rechaka*’—and not mere *suspension
of breathing*. And for these there can be no restriction as to time.

‘*Even the murderer of the embryo*.’—The term ‘*even*’ is meant to
include others also whose sins resemble that of ‘murdering the
embryo.’—(248)
