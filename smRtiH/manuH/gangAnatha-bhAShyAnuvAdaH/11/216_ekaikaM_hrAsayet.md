Having fasted on the fourteenth day, on the next day, or the Full
moon-day, he shall take fifteen morsels; the exact measure of the
‘morsel’ in this connection should be understood to be as mentioned in
another *Smṛti* (Gautama, 27.10), the words ‘*āpyāyasra*...... the
measure of the *morsel* being the quantity that does not distort the
face.’ As all the *Smṛtis* deal with the same subject, they should be
taken as mutually complementary, so long as there is no inconsistency;
and in cases of inconsistency, the two views should he taken as optional
alternatives.

Beginning with the first again, be shall reduce his food by one morsel
each day,—taking fourteen morsels on the first, thirteen on the second,
and so on, till on the fourteenth he takes only one morsel. Then having
fasted on the New-moon day (the fifteenth), he shall cat only one morsel
on the first, two on the second, and so on increasing it by one morsel
everyday, till it comes to fifteen on the Full-moon day.

‘*Upaspṛśan*’—bathing.

‘*At the three extractions*’—*i.e*., in the morning, at midday and in
the evening. This precludes the general rule that ‘the man shall bathe
thrice during the night,’—the present being a special rule.—(216)
