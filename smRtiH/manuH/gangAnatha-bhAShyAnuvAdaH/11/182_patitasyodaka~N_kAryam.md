When one has become an ‘outcast,’ and is unwilling to perform the
prescribed expiation, they shall treat him as dead and offer to him the
‘water-jar’; this is what the text lays down.

‘*Sapiṇḍas*’— Relations on the Father’s side, up to the seventh degree.

Persons other than those who may be related to the man are called
‘*relations*,’ which includes the *Sagotras* also.

‘*On an inauspicious day*’—*i.e*., on the fourteenth and such other days
of the month.

‘*In the evening*’—at sunset.

‘*Relatives, priests, etc*.’—of the persons making the offering, as also
of the outcast.—(182)
