The term ‘outcast’ connotes disqualification in regard to the rites of
twice-born men; the meaning is that he ‘falls,’ recedes, becomes
deprived of, his rights.

‘*Outcasts*,’—of the four castes, Brāhmaṇa and the rest;—‘*if one
associates with* them—*in one year he becomes an outcast*,’ he becomes
equal to the outcast.

What is it that he is supposed to do when ‘associating?’

‘*Walking, sitting and eating*’—(*a*) ‘walking’ means conversing,
touching the body and moving about in his company; similarly (*b*)
‘sitting,’ on the same bed, or on the same seat; and (*c*) ‘eating,’ on
the same seat, or out of the same dish.

‘*Sacrificing*, *teaching and forming matrimonial alliance*,’—it is with
these that ‘*not*’ has to be construed.

It becomes necessary to explain whether, by^(‘)sacrificing’ for an
outcast, one does not become an outcast at all, or he becomes so in more
or less than a year.

On the basis of other *Smṛti* -texts it is understood that by
sacrificing for an outcast, one becomes an outcast *immediately*.

The right reading would be^(‘)*yājanādhyāpanam*,’ with the Accusative
ending;—as the nouns are meant to be governed by the present-participle
term^(‘)*ācaran*,’ which also indicates the reason for what is here laid
down (for the purpose of the indication whereof the Ablative has been
used).—(180)
