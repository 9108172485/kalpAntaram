It is only the lord of a kingdom that is entitled to the performance of
a Horse-sacrifice; as the sacrificial fee prescribed in that connection
is such gold and other metals as have been won from the Eastern and

justified in laying the Fires for the purpose of these sacrifices only;
because the rites for the purposes of expiation are to be done only
along with their own accessory details, and ‘Fire-laying’ does not form
the accessory of any of these sacrifices.—(74)
