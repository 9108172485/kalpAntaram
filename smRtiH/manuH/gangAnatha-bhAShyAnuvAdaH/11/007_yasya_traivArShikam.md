This verse reiterates the logical fact that no benefit is obtained by a
man who has lost his title to the performance by transgressing a
definite prohibition.

Inasmuch as the text speaks of ‘*reward*,’ it is dear that what is here
stated pertains to voluntary performances.

‘*Even though he may have drunk Soma formerly*’—This implies that a
previous performance of the Soma-sacrifice is absolutely compulsory.

The latter half is purely declamatory; it should not be taken as
precluding the man who has *not* drunk the Soma formerly.—(7)
