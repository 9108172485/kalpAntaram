‘*Things of small value*’ do not last long; and things of small value
are such earthenware articles as a dish, a cup, and so forth, as also
such wooden things as the ‘*droṇa*,’ the ‘*āḍhaka*’ and other weights;
and such iron things as the spade, the shovel, and so forth.

‘*In the house of another*.’—The stealing of things lying in the house
is a serious offence; not so that of things lying in the field or in the
courtyard.

‘*Restored*’—given back. This pertains to all cases of theft, as it has
not been qualified in any way.

In a case where it is not possible to restore what has been stolen, the
expiation shall be the double of what is prescribed here.—(164)
