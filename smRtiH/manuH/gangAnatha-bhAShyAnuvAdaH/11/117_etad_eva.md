‘*This same*’:—this means that the expiatory rites laid down for
*cow-killing* are applicable to all ‘minor offences.’ And the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ is another optional alternative.

Inasmuch as this latter rule has been laid down with special reference
to the *other* ‘*minor offences*’ some people hold that the
‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*’ does not apply to the case of the cow-killer.

But according to this view, it will be necessary to find out why the
*cow-killer* has been mentioned at all among ‘those who have committed
*minor offences*.’—(117)
