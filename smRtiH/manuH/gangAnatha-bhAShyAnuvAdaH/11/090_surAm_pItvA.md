Though the text speaks of ‘*twice-born men*,’ yet what is said here is
meant for the Brāhmaṇa only; says another Smṛti text—‘Hot wine should be
poured on the Brāhmaṇa’ (*Gautama*, 23.1).

‘*Through folly*’—this is only explanatory.

‘*Red hot*’— Though the text uses the word ‘*varṇa*’ *colour*, yet it is
mere *heat* that is meant; as is clear from what follows, about ‘*the
body being burnt*.’—(90)
