He shall not prevent the cow from eating anything in the shape of corns,
etc.; nor shall he tell anyone else with a view to lead him to prevent
her. If, however, he ties her up for fear of danger that might befall
her otherwise,—or after she has become satisfied,—there is no harm; it
is, on the contrary, a favour.

Similarly he shall not prevent her calf from drinking her milk.—(114)
