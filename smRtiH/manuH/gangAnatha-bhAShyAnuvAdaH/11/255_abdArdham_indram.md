The verses referred to are the seven beginning with ‘*Indram mitram
varuṇamagnim*’ (Ṛgveda, 1.106.1-7).

‘*For half the year*’—for six months.

‘*The offender shall recite*.’—Since there is no qualifying epithet,
what is mentioned here should be taken as pertaining to *all offences*.

‘*Reprehensible act*.’—Sexual intercourse, or evacuation of the bowels.
If one does this in water, he should subsist, for one month, on
alms.—(255)
