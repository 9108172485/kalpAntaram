‘*He shall stand*’ etc., is an Injunction.

When some cows are standing, some are walking and some are sitting, he
shall do what most of them are doing.

‘*Free from greed*’—coveting nothing. This is only by way of
illustration; the meaning is that he shall be free from all such mental
aberrations as love, hatred and the like. That this is so is shown by
the epithet ‘*self-controlled*’.—(111)
