It is *begging* that is forbidden here; if anything comes *unasked*, the
acceptance of that is not forbidden; since it has been declared
that—‘the acceptance of riches that come unasked is declared to be no
*acceptance* at all, in accordance with special usage and texts.’

This prohibition is with reference to the begging of wealth for
sacrificial purposes, and not to that for maintaining one’s dependants.

Some people regard this verse only as supplementary to what has gone
before; the meaning being that—‘inasmuch as begging is found to be beset
with an undesirable feature, the appropriation of the property of Śūdras
should be done in other ways.’—(24)
