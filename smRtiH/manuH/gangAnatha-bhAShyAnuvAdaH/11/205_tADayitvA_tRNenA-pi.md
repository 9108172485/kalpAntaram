‘*Having struck him with a blade of grass*,’—which may not cause any
pain at all.

‘*Having tied*’—ever so gently—‘*him in the neck with a cloth*.’

‘*Having defeated him in an altercation*,’—in an ordinary quarrel.

‘*Bow to him*’—humbly,—and ‘*appease him*’

This rule does not apply to scientific debates or wranglings.—(205)
