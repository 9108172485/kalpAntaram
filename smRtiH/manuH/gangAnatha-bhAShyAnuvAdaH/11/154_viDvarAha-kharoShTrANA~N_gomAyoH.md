Since nothing has been specially mentioned, this should be understood to
apply to a case where the swallowing is done *unintentionally*. Or, both
intentional and unintentional swallowing may be regarded as being on the
same footing; as such an assumption would be better than any reduction
in the expiation (in eases of *unintentional* swallowing).—(154)
