Though the term ‘*anna*’ denotes literally ‘*what is eaten*,’ *food*,
yet it is more commonly applied to the *Vrīhi* and other *grains*, as
also to cooked rice, fried flour, cakes and so forth. It is on this
basis that Pāṇini (2.1.34) has made a distinction between ‘*anna*’ and
‘*vyañjana*.’

Thus then, inasmuch as wine is obtained from grains, it becomes liable
to be spoken of as ‘*anna*,’ ‘*grain*,’ and it comes to be spoken of as
‘*the dirty refuse of grains*.’ This description of wine is indicative
of the fact that its use is forbidden. And this indication applies to
all the three higher castes:—that the wine extracted from grains should
not be drunk by the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya or the Vaiśya. Then again it
is this wine extracted from grains to which the name is applicable more
directly than to the other two varieties, the *Gauḍī* and the *Mādhvī*.
Further, the expiation in the case of other distilled liquors is not so
heavy as in the case of the *Sīdhu* (*i.e*., the *Gauḍī*) and the
*Mādhvī*.

‘*Sin also is called* *dirt*,’—this has been added with a view to
indicate that wine is a most despicable thing.

Though the subject-matter of the present context is Expiation, yet the
Syntactical Indication of the present verse clearly points to the
*prohibition* of wine. And since it is a distinct sentence, it cannot be
regarded as a mere declamation.—(93)
