In a previous verse ‘*one eighth*’ was prescribed for the killing of a
Vaiśya; what the present verse lays down is ‘one twelfth.’

As the expiation is a light one, it has to be done ‘*for one* *year*.’

It appears that the rule here laid down is meant for the case of a
Vaiśya devoid of qualifications.

“The case of a Vaiśya *devoted to his duty* has been already dealt with
before.”

True; but what the present verse contemplates is the case of a Vaiśya
who was ‘righteous’ at the time of death, but was devoid of qualities
before that; while the previous rules apply to one who was righteous all
along.—(129)
