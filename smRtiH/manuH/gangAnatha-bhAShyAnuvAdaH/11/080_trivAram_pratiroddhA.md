‘*Fights*’—Takes up arms, or becomes wounded in the fight;—‘*at least
thrice*’—He should repeat the act at least three times. If he does the
fighting, he becomes absolved, even though he might have been killed
without having saved the Brāhmaṇa.

‘*Reconquers his entire property*.’—If the Brāhmaṇa’s property has been
taken away by thieves, if he wins it back for him, he becomes
absolved;—as also if he ‘*gives up his life*’ for the sake of the
Brāhmaṇa.

“*Giving up one’s life in defence of the Brāhmaṇa* has been already
mentioned (in the preceding verse).”

True; but what has been said in the preceding verse is that ‘the man
becomes purified if he rescues, by fighting or by some other physical
means, (1) a cow stuck in the mire, or (2) a cow being taken away by
robbers, or (3) a Brāhmaṇa, being carried away either by his enemies, or
by robbers, or by a stream’; while in the present verse what is
mentioned is doing all this ‘*for his sake*’; and what is meant is that
the man becomes absolved, if when, on his property being taken away by
robbers, the Brāhmaṇa becomes stupefied and proceeds to commit
suicide,—or when he is fighting unaided against the robbers,—if the man
comes forward and pays to him the equivalent of what he has lost, and
consoles him with such words as—‘do not commit suicide, I am giving you
this much wealth.’—(80)
