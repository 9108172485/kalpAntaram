This verse serves the purpose of recapitulating all the expiatory rites
laid down in connection with ‘*Brāhmaṇa-* Killing.’

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ stands here for *all castes*.

‘*Removes*’—destroys.

‘*On account of his being self-possessed*’—*i.e*., by reason of his
being cognisant of the true nature of the Self. In

fact a man is called ‘*self-possessed*’ when he has full faith in what
is prescribed in the scriptures; this man’s firm conviction is that what
laid down in the scriptures can never be wrong.—(86)
