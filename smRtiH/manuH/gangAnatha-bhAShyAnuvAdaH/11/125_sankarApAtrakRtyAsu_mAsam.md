The acts ‘*conducive to the degradation of mixed caste*’ and ‘*those
that make one unworthy of receiving gifts*’ have been described above
(68 and 69); and the plural number is due to the large number of acts
included in these two sets.

The term ‘*Kṛtyā*,’ ‘*acts*’ is to be construed with each of the two
terms ‘*Saṅkara*’ and ‘*apātra*’ ‘*Kṛtyā* means *deed*.

‘*The monthly Lunar penance*’—is the ‘*Cāndrāyaṇa*.’
‘*Barley-products*’—articles of food prepared from barley,—fit for
drinking or sipping and so forth.

Though the expiation mentioned here is without any distinction, yet, a
distinction has always to be made in the lightness or heaviness of the
penance, according as the act is done *intentionally or
unintentionally*.—(125)
