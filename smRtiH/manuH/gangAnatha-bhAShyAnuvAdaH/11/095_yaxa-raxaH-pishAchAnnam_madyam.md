‘*Yakṣa*’ and the rest are lower classes of beings, ignorant of the law
relating to what should and what should not be eaten; and it is they
that eat meat

The compound ‘*Surāsavam*,’ is a copulative one, *i.e*., in accordance
with Pāṇini 2.4.6.

‘*Distilled liquor*’ also is a kind of ‘*intoxicant*,’ there being a
slight difference between the two. The two are mentioned on the analogy
of such expressions as ‘the ox and the bull’

‘*Who partake of the offering to the gods*’—The cake, rice and such
substance offered to the gods are called ‘*offerings*’; as mentioned in
connection with the *Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices. It is these
that it is right and proper for the Brāhmaṇa to eat, and not wine and
meat, which are the food of the lower spirits.—(95)
