If a person is brought before the king charged with theft, under the
circumstances above described, he shall not be punished; as it is only
on account of the king’s ‘*foolishness*’—folly—‘*that the Brāhmaṇa
suffers from hunger*.’

Stress is not meant to be laid on ‘hunger’ only; as both ‘hunger’ and
‘sacrificial needs’ are meant, as is clear from the context and from the
implications of the declamatory passages.—(21)
