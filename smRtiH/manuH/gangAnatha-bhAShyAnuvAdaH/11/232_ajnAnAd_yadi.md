If after having performed the expiation for a certain misdeed, one
commits the same act again, he becomes liable to a heavier expiation. It
is in view of this that it is said that ‘*he must not do it a second
time*.’

Or the words ‘*he must not do it a second time*’ may be taken as a
declamatory assertion commendatory of the ‘renunciation of misdeeds’
enjoined before (in 130);—the sense being that ‘he shall not abandon his
vow.’

Hence if one seeks absolution from the sin involved in the first
transgression, he should not repeat the act. Thus what is meant is that
merely by performing the expiation, one does not become freed from a
sin, if he commits the same act again.

But it does not stand to reason that, the man is not. absolved from sin,
both when he performs the expiation and when he does not perform it.
Hence the assertion in the present, verse must be taken simply as
indicating that there is heavy expiation in the case of committing the
deed over again.—(232)
