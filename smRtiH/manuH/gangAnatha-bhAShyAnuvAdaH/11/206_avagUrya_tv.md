This is a prohibition of *threatening*; the rest is purely declamatory.

‘*Jighāṃsayā*’—with the intention of injuring, if one raises a stick or
some such weapon,—‘*he remains in hell for a hundred years*’;—and ‘*for
one thousand years, if he has actually struck him*.’

‘*With the intention of injuring*’—*i.e*., not in mere joke.—(200)
