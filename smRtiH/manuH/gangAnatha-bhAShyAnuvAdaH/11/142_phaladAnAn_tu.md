‘*Fruit-bearing trees*’—such as the Mango, the Kaṇṭakī and the like.

The *reciting of one hundred* *Ṛk* *verses* is meant for twice-born men.

“What then is to be the expiation for a Śūdra?”

Some people hold that for them the expiation shall be the same as for
the ‘*minor offence*’ of ‘cutting green trees for fuel.’ This, however,
cannot be right, as that would be too heavy.

“If that is too heavy, why should it have been prescribed in connection
with *minor offences*?”

The expiation laid down there was for repeated acts.

For these reasons, for the Śūdra cutting fruit-bearing trees, etc., the
expiation shall be fasting for two or three days.

‘*Shrubs*,’ *etc*.—have been already explained.

‘*Latā*’—stands here for branches of trees.—(142)
