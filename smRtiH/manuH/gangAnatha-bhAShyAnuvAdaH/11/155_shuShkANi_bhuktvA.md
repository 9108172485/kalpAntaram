‘*Dried meat*’— such for instance, as dried pork and so forth.

‘*Growing m the ground*.’—This epithet has been added with a view to
show that those growing in cavities are not forbidden.

‘*Unrecognised*’—it being unascertainable whether it is flesh of sheep
or of buffalo.

‘*Slaughter-house*’—where animals are killed for sale. In the case of
meat found in other places, the expiation is a light one.

“In fact when the text emphasises the qualification of ‘*lying in the
slaughter-house*,’ there should be no harm in meat obtained elsewhere.”

It is not so; since all meat connected with the ‘slaughterhouse’ has
been forbidden in general terms. Though as regards expiation, a
comparative reduction or enhancement would always he proper, in view of
the exact place from where the meat has been obtained.

‘*This same*’—*i.e*., the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

When, however, the exact species of the animal is known, the repeated
eating of such meat, would involve the drinking of barley-gruel for
seven days. In the rest, ‘one should fast during the day.’—(155)
