They say that on one day there should be a combination of *cow’s urine*
and other tilings down to ‘*Kuśa-water*’; and this is to be followed by
*fastingy for one ḍay*. Thus the ‘*Sāntapana*’ lasts for two days.

Others hold that each of the things named has to be eaten on one day,—as
no combination is found mentioned anywhere;—and according to this view,
the ‘*Sāntapana*’ would last for *seven days*. Both these views have
been held by another *Smṛti text*.—(212)
