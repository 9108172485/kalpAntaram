The present verse describes what sort of water-offering is to be made
for one who has performed the prescribed penance.

‘*They shall bathe with him in a reservoir of water*,’—in a sacred
river, or in a large lake, or in some such sacred place as Prabhāsa,
Mānasa and the like;—‘*and throw a fresh jar full of water*.’

Since the present text speaks of the ‘fresh jar’ and the foregoing one
speaks of the ‘female slave,’ it means that in the former case, the jar
to be used should be one that has been already in use for other
purposes. In both cases the jar is to be filled with water.—(186)
