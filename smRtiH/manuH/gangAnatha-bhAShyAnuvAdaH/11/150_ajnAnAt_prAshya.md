‘*Ordure or wine*’—is meant to include *semen* also; since we read in
another Smṛti—‘This same expiation applies to the case of the eating of
ordure, stenching corpse *and semen*.’

“Whose *ordure* and *urine* are meant here?”

Of men; the ease of those of other animals we shall deal with later on.

In connection with this offence also, the ‘*Tapta* - *Kṛcchra*’ has to
be combined with what is here laid down; reasons for which have been
already explained above.

Stress is meant to be laid upon the term ‘*twice-born*’; since another
expiation for Śūdras is going to be laid down later on.

‘*Unwittingly*.’—This is only a reiteration; who is there who would
swallow ordure or urine *intentionally*?

Further, in connection with the (intentional) drinking of intoxicants,
it has been laid down that ‘having partaken of an intoxicant, one should
perform the ‘*Kṛcchra*’; so that if Initiation were the only expiation
meant for the *intentional* swallowing of ordure and urine, the text
would imply that both (eating of ordure and drinking of an intoxicant)
stand on the same footing (which is absurd).
