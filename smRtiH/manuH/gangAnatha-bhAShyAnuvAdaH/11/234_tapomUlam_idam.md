In the world of men whatever ‘*happiness*’—in the form of glory of
lordship over men and countries and so forth—or *physical*, in the form
of good health and the like,—or *social*, such as that obtained from
wealth, children and so forth—or the *sensual*, in the form of pleasures
derived from the wife and others;—and also that of the gods,—what has
been described in the Veda, in such passages as ‘hundred pleasures of
men constitute one pleasure of the gods’;—of all this austerity is the
‘*source*,’—the cause of its origin.

Austerity is its ‘*middle*’— The continued existence of a thing is
called its ‘*middle*.’

Similarly Austerity is its ‘*end*..’

The view of persons learned in the Veda is that Austerity brings about
the same desirable results, in the form of Heaven and other desirable
things, as those brought about by the sacrificial and other acts.—(234)
