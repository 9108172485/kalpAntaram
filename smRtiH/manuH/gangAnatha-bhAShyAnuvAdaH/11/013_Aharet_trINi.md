If the thing required is not available in the house of a Vaiśya, it may
be taken from that of a Śūdra.

‘*Two or three*.’—These must be taken as referring to sacrificial
requisites, since it is these that the text is dealing with.

The text adds a declamatory statement—‘*The Śūdra has nothing to do with
sacrifices*

Though the appropriation has been spoken of above as to be done by
several methods, vet in the ease of the *Śūdra*, there should be no
*begging*, since it is distinctly said that—‘the Brāhmaṇa shall not beg
wealth, for the purpose of sacrifices, from a Śūdra.’—(24)

“In another Smṛti, the performance of sacrifices with wealth belonging
to the Śūdra has been prohibited without any exceptions.”

On the strength of the present text itself, it follows that one may
accept gifts from the Śūdra.

Others however explain that when the wealth has been appropriated by the
Brāhmaṇa, it is no longer ‘wealth belonging to the Śūdra.’

As a matter of fact, however, what the prohibition refers to is the
doing of ‘*Śānti*’ and ‘*Pauṣṭika*’ rites for the Śūdra. And a
performance is actually called after that wealth which the *Ṛtvik*
priest actually employs in the performance; and there is no doubt that
in the case of the sacrifices in question, the performance would be
styled as done with wealth belonging to the *Śūdra*,’ in view of the
fact that the wealth originally belonged to him, even though it may not
do so at the time of the performance itself.—(13)
