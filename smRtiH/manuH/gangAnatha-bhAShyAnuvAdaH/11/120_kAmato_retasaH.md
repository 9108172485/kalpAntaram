This verse supplies the explanation of the meaning of the term
‘*avakīṛṇīn*’ ‘immoral religious student’;—from which it is clear that
the term ‘*vrata*’ here stands for something other than the penances
mentioned in the present context

‘*Keeping up his vows*.’—On the strength of other Smṛti texts, this
should be understood to mean ‘one who is in the state of the Religious
Student’; as it is for such a one that emission of semen, even without
sexual intercourse, has been specially forbidden.

The rule here laid down applies to the case, of *intentional* emission
of semen.—(120)
