The actual form of Vaiśvānarī sacrifice should be learnt from the
*Gṛhyasūtras*.

‘*Change of year*’—when one year ends and another begins.

‘*Prescribed*’—enjoined.

‘*Animal and Soma sacrifices*’—the compulsory ones. The six-monthly and
yearly ‘Animal sacrifices’ are compulsory, as also the ‘Soma sacrifice’
every spring.

‘*In the event of the impossibility of the performance*’—of these, on
account of the absence of the requisite wealth;—‘*in* *expiation
thereof*.’—for the removal of the sin incurred by the omission of a
compulsory rite.

In connection with the occasion here referred to, the Veda lays down
other expiatory rites; and some people would combine these with what is
here prescribed; their point being that, even though both the rites
serve the same purpose, yet they are found to be laid down by two
distinct authorities.

This however is not right; because in connection with the expiatory
rites for the slaying of a Brāhmaṇa, our Author is going to declare, in
so many words, that between the rite laid down in the *Veda* and that
prescribed in the *Smṛti*, there should be *option*:—‘He may perform the
Abhijit or the Viśvajit’ (11.75).—(27)
