‘*Men*’—slaves.

‘*Women*’—slave girls.

‘*Field*’—plot of land, where *Vrīhi* and other corns are grown.

The word ‘*water*’ is to be construed both with ‘*wells* and *tanks*.’
What is here laid down applies to a case where water has been drawn from
the well or the tank and preserved in a cistern and such, other smaller
reservoirs.

From the mention of ‘*water*’ here it follows that for the
misappropriating of *dry* wells and tanks, there is another law.

‘*Vāpī*’ is a synonym for ‘*taḍāga*’ (tank).—(163)
