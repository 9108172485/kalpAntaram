The time for the Brāhmaṇa’s Initiation has been laid down as extending
up to the sixteenth year of his age; and the present text lays down the
expiation for transgressing this limit.

If to a Brāhmaṇa the *Sāvitrī* has not been taught—from the seventh to
the sixteenth year of his age—the ‘*teaching of the Sāvitrī*’ stands
here for the sacrament of *Initiation*; hence the meaning is ‘if the
Initiation has not been performed at the said time’; similarly up to the
twenty-second year for the Kṣatriya, and the twenty-fourth year for the
Vaiśya,—then after the lapse of this time, he should be made to perform
three ‘*Kṛcchra*’ penances. Where the term ‘Kṛcchra’ stands without an
epithet, it means the *Prājāpatya* penance,—such is the well-known usage
of *Smṛti*.

Others explain the ‘*Kṛcchra*’ here as standing for the
*Kṛcchātikṛcchra*.

After these *Kṛcchra* penances have been performed, he should be
initiated.

‘*In due form*’— This is purely reiterative.—(191)
