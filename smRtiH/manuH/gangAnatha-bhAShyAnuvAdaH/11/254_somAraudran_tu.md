The three verses beginning with ‘*Somārudrā dhārayethamastram*’ (Ṛgveda,
6.74.1); and the verse beginning with ‘*Aryamaṇam varuṇam mitram*’
(Ṛgveda, 4.2.4).

‘*Samām*’—for one year.

This verse (laying down a single expiation for one who has committed
*many sins*) lends support to the view that a single expiation may serve
to atone for several offences.

‘*In a stream*.’—This precludes tanks and pools.—(254)
