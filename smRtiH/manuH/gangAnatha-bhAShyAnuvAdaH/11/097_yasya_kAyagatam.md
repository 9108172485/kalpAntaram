When the Veda has been duly studied, it remains in the man’s heart, in
the form of memory; and it is the Veda thus committed to memory that is
called here ‘*Brahman*.’ The meaning thus is that when the heart has
become ‘*deluged with wine*,’ the man becomes a *Śūdra*.

‘*Brāhmaṇahood*’ has been mentioned with a view to indicate that all
kinds of wine are forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa,—the wine distilled from
grains alone being forbidden for the *Kṣatriya* and *Vaiśya*.—(97)
