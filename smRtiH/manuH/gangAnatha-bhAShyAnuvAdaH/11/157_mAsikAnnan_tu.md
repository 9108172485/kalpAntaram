‘*Monthly rite*’—*i.e*., the ‘*Ekoddiṣṭa*’ *śrāddha*, which is performed
every month, for one year, till the performance of the
‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*.’ Though the *śrāddha* performed on the new-moon day is
also called a ‘monthly śrāddha,’ eating at it has been permitted by such
texts as—‘when invited he may freely eat’; how then could there be any
expiation needed in this case?

Others have held that what is permitted is eating *on invitation*, so
that if one eats *without invitation* at the new-moon śrāddhas also, he
should be liable to the said expiation.

‘*Who has not completed his course of study*’—*i.e*., while one is still
residing with the teacher; *i.e*., the Religious Student.

Out of the three days, on any ono day, he may remain in water. Since the
‘three days’ are mentioned, there would be no justification for adding a
fourth day.—(157)
