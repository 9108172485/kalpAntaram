The ‘*refugee*’ is of two kinds, as described above (under
190),—‘*abandoning*’—discarding of him, if one is able to afford him
protection (is sinful). This has been discussed before.

‘*Tampered with the Veda*’—(*a*) Has studied it on a day on which it
should not be studied;—or (*b*) has interfered with a man who is reading
it in the correct form, by telling him some such tiling as—‘What are you
reading?—You have mangled the text,’—or (*c*) through greed for wealth
recites it, without being invited to do so. The Smṛti has declared
that—‘by reciting the Veda for gain one becomes degraded, says
Manu.’—(198)
