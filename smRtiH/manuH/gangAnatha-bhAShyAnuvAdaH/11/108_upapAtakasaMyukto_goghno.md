‘*Cow-killer*’—one who has killed a cow; the word being formed with the
‘*Ka*’ affix.

‘*Shall drink barley*.’—Some people explain this to mean a drink mixed
with barley. Others, however, hold that the name of the original
substance (barley) has been used in the sense of its product; hence what
is meant is that the man shall drink *barley-gruel*.

In the ease of the former explanation, it is necessary to assume the
addition of water or some liquid substance, without its being mentioned
in the text; as mere barley-grains cannot be drunk, until they are mixed
up with a liquid substance.

In the second explanation, however, all that is necessary is to take the
word ‘barley’ in a figurative sense; and certainly, a figurative or
indirect signification is much simpler than the assumption of what is
not mentioned at all.

‘*Having shaved his head*’—with his hair shaved off; or it may simply
mean *with his hairs cut*.

‘*Cow-pen*’—the place where cows sit and rest.

‘*Covered with the skin of the cow*’—not necessarily of the cow that has
been killed; it may be of another cow also.—(108)
