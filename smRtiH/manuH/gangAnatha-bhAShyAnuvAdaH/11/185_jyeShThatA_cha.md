‘*The additional share of property due to the eldest*.’—In connection
with this, the following objection is raised:—“The declaration that all
property shall be withheld from him clearly implies the withholding also
of the additional share due to the eldest”

In answer to this some people explain that the said *withholding* is
reiterated in the present verse, for the purpose of laying down that the
said share shall devolve upon the younger brother who excels him in
quality.

Others however think that the term ‘Property’ stands for all kinds of
wealth, not for the *hereditary* property only; as in the lexicon we
find ‘*dāyādya*’ (which is the word used in the preceding verse)
mentioned as a synonym for ‘*dhana*’, ‘property.’ Hence what is meant by
the withholding of ‘property’ from him means that one may not pay to him
what may have been borrowed from him; what the debtor should do is to
repay the same to the man’s son, brother or other heirs.

Others again hold that the withholding of ‘property’ is meant to apply
to the case where the property has not been previously divided, while
what is meant by the present verse is that if division has already taken
place, all that shall be taken away from him is only the additional
share that he may have received by virtue of his being the eldest
brother; so that even though the man may have sons, they shall inherit
all the rest of his property, save the said additional share.—(185)
