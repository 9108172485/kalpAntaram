‘*The Sāvitrī three thousand times*’— Some people take this to mean that
this should be done everyday; while others construe ‘*trīṇi*’ with
‘*māsam*’ \[the meaning being, that the whole is to run for *three
months*\]; so that the *mantra* would have to be repeated one hundred
times everyday.

‘*Cow-pen*’—the place where cows are kept.—(194)
