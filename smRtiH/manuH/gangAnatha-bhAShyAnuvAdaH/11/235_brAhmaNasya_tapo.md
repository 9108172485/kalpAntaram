The foregoing should not give rise to the following idea—“Inasmuch as
such great things are said of Austerity, by its means I can get all I
want, even without doing the acts enjoined for me; specially as, on
account of my not possessing the requisite materials, I am not in a
position to perform all that is enjoined.”

It would not be right to entertain this idea, because—‘*the Austerity
for the Brāhmaṇa is Knowledge*.’ ‘*Knowledge*’ here stands for the
understanding of what is contained in the Veda; so long as the man does
not acquire this, nothing can accomplish anything for him. Hence it is
*Knowledge* that is called ‘Austerity.’

What the verse means is that even in times of distress one should not
neglect his duties.

‘*Knowledge*’ here stands for all the duties of the Brāhmaṇa, beginning
with the study of the Veda.

Similarly ‘*protecting*’ is the ‘*austerity*’ for the Kṣatriya.

‘*For* *the Śūdra*, *service*’—of twice-born men; it is the serving of
these that has been prescribed for him; of which the present verse is
only a reiteration.—(235)
