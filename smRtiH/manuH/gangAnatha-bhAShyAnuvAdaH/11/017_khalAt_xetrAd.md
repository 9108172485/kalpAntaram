**(verses 11.16-17)**

The property of another person may he seized also when one’s own family
is suffering from want

‘*Not lasting till the morrow*.’—The addition of this phrase implies
that the taking of only that much is permitted which may maintain the
family for one day,—and no more.

‘*From one whose sacred duties are neglected*’—implies that it may be
taken for the purpose of sacred rites.

Another *Smṛti* says—‘At first one should appropriate from a person of
lower status than himself; if no such be available, then from a man of
equal status; and in the event of this also being not available, even
from a person of superior righteousness.’

‘*For the seventh meal*.’—If the man has not eaten for three days he may
appropriate another’s property for his morning meal on the fourth day.
Two meals a day have been laid down in such texts as—‘one shall eat in
the morning and in the evening.’

‘*Or from any place*.’—Even out of the garden and such places.

‘*He should confess it*’—but ‘*to the questioner*’ *only*;—‘*if he
questions him*,’—*i.e*., he should not send for him and force the owner
to question him.

Or the ‘*questioner*’ may stand for the owner of the property, and ‘*if
he questions him*’ for the king; the king questioning him when he is
taken before him (and charged with having taken away the property). In
this manner we may distinguish between the two terms ‘*pṛcchate*’ and
‘*pṛcchati*.’ Says Gautama (18. 30)—‘Questioned by the king he should
confess it’

What is said here should be understood to apply to both cases—*want of
food*, and shortage of sacrificial requisites.—(16-17)
