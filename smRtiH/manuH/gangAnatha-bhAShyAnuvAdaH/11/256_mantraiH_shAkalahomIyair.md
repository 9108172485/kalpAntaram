‘*Sacred texts related to the Śākala-homa*’ are the eight verses
beginning with—‘*Devakṛtasyainasovayajanamaṣi*’ (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā,
8.13);—if one makes Homa-offerings of clarified butter with these texts,
for one year, he destroys even the ‘*most grievous sin*,’—*i.e*., even
all the ‘heinous offences.’

‘By repeating’ the mantra ‘*namo rudrāya tavase kapardine, etc*.’
(Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 16)—for one year,—he obtains the same success;—even
without performing the *Śākala-homa*.

Thus this ‘repeating of the mantra’ is an expiation alternative to the
aforesaid ‘Śākala-homa’; as also to the reciting of some other text
beginning with ‘*namaḥ*’,—what this other text is being ascertained from
cultured men.—(256)
