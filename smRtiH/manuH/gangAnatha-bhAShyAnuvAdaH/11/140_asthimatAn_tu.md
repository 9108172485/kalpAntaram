‘*With bones*.’—This denotes the smallness of the body; as is clear from
its being mentioned along with ‘*boneless* animals.’

‘*Anas*’ is cart, which stands here as a measure.

Though this expiation has been laid down here, yet, something else also
has got to be done, as laid down in the next versa—(140)
