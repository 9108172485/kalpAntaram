^(‘)*Samutkarṣe*’—The Locative ending denotes *purpose*; just as in the
expression ‘*carmaṇi dvīpinam hanti*’ (‘kills the tiger for the sake of
his skin’). When a man lies with the motive of securing honour for
himself, his offence is equal to that of killing a Brāhmaṇa. For
instance, on an occasion great honour or much wealth is expected to be
obtained by every one who is a Brāhmaṇa, or a Vedic scholar, or belongs
to a high family,—if one falsely represents himself as such; or when a
person needs a qualified recipient for his gifts, if one, though not so
qualified, represents himself to be as such. In such cases the man lies
‘*for self-aggrandisement*’; this is what is meant, and not any small
gain for oneself; even though this latter also may be called
‘*samutkarṣe*.’

One is said to ‘caluminate’ people when he falsely attributes evils to
him.

‘*Falsely harassing the preceptor*’—causing him pain and anxiety by
falsely telling him such things as ‘your unmarried daughter is
pregnant,’ and so forth; which implies needless hatred. Or,
‘*nirbandha*’ may stand for quarrelling with him before the King, or
bringing a false (barge against him. Says Gautama,—‘False accusation of
the Teacher, etc...... are equal to the heinous offences.’ (21.10)—(55)
