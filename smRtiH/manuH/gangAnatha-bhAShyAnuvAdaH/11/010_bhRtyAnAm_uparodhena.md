**(verses 11.9-10)  
**

This is a deprecatory declamation in support of what has gone before.

‘*Persons he has got to maintain*’—already described.

‘*Detriment*’— depriving them of food and clothing and other
necessaries.

‘*For his benefit after death*’—For the purpose of accomplishing for
himself rewards in the other world.

‘*Conducive to unhappy results*’— The ‘*Udarka*,’ *i.e*., the ‘future
result’ of such giving turns out to be ‘unhappy’.—(9-10).

\[Verse 10 translated here has been quoted by Medhātithi in the Bhāṣya
on 3.72.\]
