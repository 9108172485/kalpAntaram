+++
The syllable ‘*hum*’ is uttered as a sign of anger and insult; *e.g*.,
in such expressions as—‘Keep quiet, hum! don’t speak like this’ and so
forth;—the syllable ‘*hum*’ being uttered by way of a prohibition.

‘*Against a Brāhmaṇa*,’—be he older, or equal or younger, a pupil or a
son.

Similarly—‘*if he addresses a superior person as* “*Thou*,”’—*e.g*.,
‘Thou sayest so,’ ‘thou didst this.’

The expiation here laid down is for the use of the singular form of the
pronoun ‘*Yuṣmat*’; and no significance is meant to be attached to the
special Nominative-ending (in the term ‘*tvam*’ here used). In actual
usage, speaking to their superiors, people make use of such forms as
‘*Yuṣmāsu*’ the Plural form (in the Locative).

‘*Should bathe and fast*’—which moans the dropping of the morning-meal.

‘*Having saluted*’—fallen on his feet,—‘he shall *propitiate him*’—make
him give up his anger—and then take his meal.—(204)
