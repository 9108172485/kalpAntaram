‘*Trisyllablic*’—*i.e*., a composite of the three syllables contained in
the word ‘Om.’

The ‘*primeval Brahman*,’ which is ‘*esoteric*’—as being set forth in
detail in the esoteric sections of the Veda, where it is put forward as
an object of worship. Or it may be regarded as ‘*esoteric*’ on account
of its being denotative of the supreme soul, and not in the sense of
*being unknown*; since it is well-known among people as the syllable
‘*Om*.’

That wherein the Vedic Triad lies condensed,—since all letters are
described as contained in ‘Om.’ The worship or meditation of this has
been already described above, as also in such passages as—‘One should
meditate upon the syllable *Om*’ (Chāndogya Upa, 1.1.1).

The preceding verse has spoken of the Mantras as the ‘Veda,’ while in
the present verse it is the *Vedānta* that is so spoken of. As for
knowledge of *duties*, this is provided by what has been enjoined under
‘Vedic Study.’—(265)
