This verse is asserting, in another way, the fact that Vedic Study and
other compulsory duties are destructive of sins. And this appears to be
meant for those acts in connection with which no specific expiations
have been prescribed, or those that may have been committed unknowingly.

Others have held that this verse also should be understood as addressed
to those who may be led to think that the injunction of Austerities in
the present context means that Brāhmaṇas may omit all other duties; just
the same contingency that was suspected in connection with the previous
statement that ‘for the Brāhmaṇa, knowledge is austerity’ (Verse 235).

‘Tolerance’ has been mentioned as standing for all the qualities of the
soul.

‘*Even those due to heinous offences*.’—This term ‘*even*’ appears to be
commendatory; it does not mean that the heinous offences are actually
set aside; and from all that has been said before it follows that what
is meant is that these grievous sins cease to be immediately
operative.—(245)
