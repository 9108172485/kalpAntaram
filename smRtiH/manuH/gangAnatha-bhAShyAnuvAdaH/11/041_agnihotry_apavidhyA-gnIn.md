‘*Neglects*’—omits to tend; this may mean either the absolute omission
of the rite, or allowing the fires to be extinguished.

The text lays down the Expiatory Rite here, because the text has been
dealing with the Agnihotra.

Inasmuch as the text speaks of ‘*fires*’ (in the plural), what is here
said may also he assumed to be applicable to the neglect of the
‘domestic fire.’

‘*Equal* to *the killing of a hero*’—in view of the declaration,—‘he who
allows the fires to become extinguished is regarded by the gods as the
*slayer of a hero*.’

The addition of the qualifying team ‘*wilfully*’ indicates that when the
neglect is *not wilful*, there should be some other form of
expiation.—(41)
