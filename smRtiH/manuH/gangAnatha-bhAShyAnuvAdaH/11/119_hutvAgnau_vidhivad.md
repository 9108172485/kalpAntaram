The ‘oblations into Fire’ are those spoken of in the texts
‘*Hṛdayasyāgre*, etc.’

‘*Finally*’— after the oblations have been finished,—he shall offer
oblations to the Maruts, to Indra, to Bṛhaspati and to Agni, with the
verse ‘*Samāsiñcantu marutaḥ samindraḥ sambṛhaspatiḥ sañcāyamagniḥ
siñcatu prajayā ca dhanea* (?) *ca*’ (Atharva-Veda Saṃhitā, 7.33.1).

Since the precise ‘deities’ of sacrifices are always those indicated by
the words of the *mantras* used at them, the words ‘*vāta*’ and ‘*guru*’
of the text should be taken as standing for ‘Maruts’ and ‘Bṛhaspati’
respectively. Hence when the offerings are actually made, the words
pronounced should be ‘*Marudbhyaḥ svāhā*’ and ‘*Bṛhaspataye svāhā*,’—and
not ‘*vātāya svāhā*’ and ‘*gurave svāhā*.’— (119)
