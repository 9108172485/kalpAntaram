In the case of any one of these expiations, the epithet ‘red-hot’ is to
be applied.

The cow’s urine and other substances have been specified with a view to
predude dying by any other means.

In the present case, the ‘wine’ should be understood as standing for
that liquor which is obtained from grains; as it is this liquor to which
the term ‘wine’ is held to be directly applicable; its application to
other liquors being indirect What is said here is applicable to cases of
*intentional* wine-drinking; sis it is going to be declared later on
(11.146)—“If one drinks wine unintentionally, he becomes purified by
going through the sacramental rites.’

‘*Agnivarna*,’ ‘*red-hot*,’ means that it should be *as hot as fire*; as
is clear from the phrase ‘*until he dies*.’

Wine is forbidden for women also. It has been declared in the work of
Vaśiṣṭha that—‘If a Brāhmaṇa woman drinks wine, the gods do not permit
her to go to the regions where her husband has gone; she roams about in
this world, and after all her merit has been exhausted, she becomes an
amphibious animal.’—(91)
