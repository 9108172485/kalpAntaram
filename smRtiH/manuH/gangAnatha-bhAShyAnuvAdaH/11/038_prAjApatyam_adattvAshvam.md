In connection with the Fire-laying rite, a horse is to be given as the
‘fee.’ the term ‘*prājāpatya*’ is added for the purpose of eulogising
the horse. Or, the term may be taken to mean ‘neither very good nor very
bad,’ in which sense ordinary men use the name ‘*prajāpati*.’

‘*Possessed of wealth*.’—This means that if the man does not give the
fee, on account of his not possessing wealth,—then he does become
regarded as one who has laid the Fires.—(38)
