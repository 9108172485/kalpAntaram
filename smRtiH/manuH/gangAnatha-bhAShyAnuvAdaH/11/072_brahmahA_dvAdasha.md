^(‘)*Hut*’—a house built of grass and leaves, capable of resisting rain,
heat and cold.

‘*Samāḥ*’—years.

‘*Subsisting on alms*.’—Another Smṛti text lays down that these alms
shall be obtained from twelve houses, not in close proximity to one
another.

‘*The head of the dead man*’—Either the head of the man killed by him,
or a wooden or some other image of the head, shall be held aloft Such is
the explanation given by some people.

But men knowing the right meaning of words do not accept this
explanation as this is not what is meant by the term ‘*śavaśiraḥ*.’

Other rules to be observed by the man are going to be described under
78.—(72)
