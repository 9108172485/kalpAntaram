After the treatment of the ‘Heinous Offences,’ other ‘*sins, great and
small*,’—*i.e*., the ‘minor offences,’—are next dealt with.

He who ‘*desires to expiate*’ these should ‘*repeat for one year the
verse beginning with* “ava.”’—The term ‘*ava*’ indicates the opening
word of the verse ‘*Ava te hedo varuṇa namobhiḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda,
1.24.14),—this verse containing words indicating *absolution from sins*;
it does not stand for the other verse beginning with
‘*ava*’—‘*avatadenīmāheturāṇam*.’ Or, he shall recite the verse
‘*Yatkiñcedam varuṇa daivyejanaḥ, etc*.’ (Ṛgveda, 7.89.5).—(252)
