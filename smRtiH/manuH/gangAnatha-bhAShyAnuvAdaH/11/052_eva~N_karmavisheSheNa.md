**(verses 11.49-52)**

By killing a Brāhmaṇa one becomes affected by *consumption*—a very
serious disease known among physicians by that name.

One who has intercourse with his preceptor’s wife suffers from
‘disfigured skin.’

The ‘*informer*’ has a nose emitting nauseous smell; and ‘*the false
caluminator has a foul-smelling mouth*.’

“The *caluminator* also is only an *informer*.”

True; but one of them (the former) assumes other people’s defects, while
the other describes only those that really exist;—that is the sole
difference between the two.

‘*Excess of limbs*’—more than the natural number.

‘*Adulterator*’—one who mixes commodities with inferior ones resembling
it, *e.g*., saffron with the *Kusumbha* flower.

‘*Dyspeptic*’—one who cannot digest the food eaten.

^(‘)*Dumbness*’—Incapability of speech; *e.g*., the idiot, the epileptic
and the like.

The rest is well known.

^(‘)*Deformed*.’—Their figure is despicable.

All this is the result of ‘*particular acts*.’ These acts bring about
the said effects instead of making the men sink into hell and suffer
after-death tortures; or even for those who, even though they have
passed through all these latter, have still some remnant left of the
force of their past misdeeds; or for those in whose case the force of
their meritorious deeds being greater, the effects of the evil deeds
have had no occasion to assert themselves. In all such cases there is a
‘residue’ of past acts.—(49-52)
