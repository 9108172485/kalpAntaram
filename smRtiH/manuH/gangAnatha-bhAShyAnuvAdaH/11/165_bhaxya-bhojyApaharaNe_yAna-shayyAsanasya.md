‘*Conveyance*’—the cart and such things.

‘*Bed*’—the bedstead, and so forth.

‘*Seat*’—the mat, the stool, or wooden slab.

‘*Eatables and edibles*.’—The distinction between the two should be
understood to be this that while one stands for what is dry and
scattered, the other stands for the reverse;—‘*eatables\`*’ standing for
such things as sweetmeats, cakes and the like and ‘*edibles*’ for
barley-gruel and such things.

‘*Five Products of the Cow*’—These are well-known.

Here also what is mentioned should be eaten for one day only.—(165)
