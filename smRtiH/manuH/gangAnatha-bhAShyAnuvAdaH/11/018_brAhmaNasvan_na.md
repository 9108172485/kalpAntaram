‘*The Kṣatriya*’— This is meant to include the Vaiśya and the Śūdra
also.

‘*Never*’—*i.e*., not even in times of the greatest distress.

‘*Robber and one who neglects his duties*.’—That is, Brāhmaṇas having
this character. ‘*Robber*’ is the thief, and ‘*one who neglects his
duties*’ is the person who does not observe the rules governing the
life-stages.—(18)
