‘*He who has violated his preceptor’s bed*’—Another reading his
‘*Gurutalpī*’;—the term ‘*talpī*’ ending in the possessive affix, stands
for a particular form of intercourse between man and woman.

By ‘*preceptor*,’ here is meant the Preceptor as well as the Father. And
‘*bed*’ stands for the *wife*.

The expiation here laid down is for intercourse with the wife of one’s
preceptor, or with a step-mother of the same caste; and the three
expiations here set forth refer to a case where the act has been
intentional.

‘*Confess his guilt*’— proclaim his crime.

He shall lie down upon a bed of iron as hot as fire; that this is what
is meant is dear by the next sentence—‘*He becomes purified by death*.’

‘*Sūrmi*’ is image of a woman, made of iron. This he shall
embrace.—(103)
