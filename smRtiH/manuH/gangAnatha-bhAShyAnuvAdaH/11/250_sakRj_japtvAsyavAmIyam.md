From the mention of ‘*once*’ in the present text, it follows that in the
foregoing verses, a *repetition* is meant; and this is also indicated by
usage and by what we find expressly stated in other cases:—*e.g*.,
‘Having recited the “Aghamarṣaṇa Hymn” *three times*’ (259); which is
connected with conditional liability.

‘*Āsyavāmīya*’ is the name of that hymn ‘which contains the word
*asyavama*,’—the word being formed according to Pāṇini, 5.2.59. This is
a hymn containing fifty-two verses, beginning with the words ‘*asya
vāmasya palitasya hotuḥ*’ (Ṛgveda, 1.164.1.).

‘*Śivasaṅkalpa Hymn*’—consisting of six verses, beginning with
‘*yajjāgrato dūramudaiti*.’ (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 34.1).—(250)
