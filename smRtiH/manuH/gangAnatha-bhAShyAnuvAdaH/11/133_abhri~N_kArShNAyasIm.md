No stress is meant to be laid on the mention of the. ‘*Brāhmaṇa*.’

A sharp ‘iron *spade*’ should be given. The qualification ‘iron’
excludes the spade made of wood and other substances.

‘*In the case of a eunuch*’—one who is wanting in virility; who is of
four kinds—(1) he who has no semen at all, (2) he whose semen is of mere
air, (3) who feels no erection of the organ, and (4) who has the signs
of both sexes, a hermaphrodite. This expiation regarding the killing of
the *eunuch* is applicable to all animals—Brāhmaṇa, Śūdra, sheep, goat,
and so forth.—(133)
