title = "166 तृण-काष्ठ-द्रुमाणाञ् च"

+++
The expiation here laid down is for the stealing of grass and other
things, in such quantities, as would be more valuable than the
‘conveyance’ and other things mentioned in the preceding verse,

‘*Wood*’— hot made into any article. That this is what is meant follows
from its occurring along with ‘trees.’

‘*Druma*’ is tree.

‘*Dry food*’—either rice, or fried barley.

‘*Molasses*.’— This stands for things made of molasses; so that
sugarcandy and other sweetmeats become included.

‘*Caila*’ is *cloth*;—*i.e*., of large quantities of valuable cloth.

The expiation here laid down is an optional alternative to the *Kṛcchra*
that would be necessary in accordance with what is laid down in Verse
163, where the stealing of ‘wealth’ (which includes cloth) has been
dealt with.

‘*Leather*’ stands here for *armour*.

‘*Māṃsa*’—meat.—(166)
