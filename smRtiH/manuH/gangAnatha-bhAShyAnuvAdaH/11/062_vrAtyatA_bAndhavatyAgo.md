‘*Relations*.’—The maternal uncle, cousins and others, even apart from
one’s uterine brothers. If one has the means, it behoves him to support
all these, if they be starving. This is what has been spoken of above in
Verse 9.

“In face of the present text, the mention of the abandoning of one’s son
(in 60) becomes superfluous.”

It is not superfluous. The mention of both is like the case where all
web-footed birds having been forbidden in general, the Swan is specially
prohibited separately.

Hence the abandoning of the mother and those mentioned in the former
verse is also a *minor offence*, like what is mentioned in the present
verse; with this difference only that this latter is less serious.

‘*Teaching for wages and learning from a paid teacher*’—*i.e*., if one
learns from a paid teacher, when unpaid teachers are available.

‘*What should not he sold*’—as described in Discourse X (Verses 86, *et
seq*).—(62)
