‘*Polluted by a heinous offence*.’—It is understood that this also
refers to the number of such offences enumerated above; and it is quite
reasonable for several expiations for each of the lighter offences.

‘*Pāvamānī verses*.’—This stands for the entire ‘*maṇḍala*,’ beginning
with the verse ‘*svādiṣṭhayā madiṣṭhayā, etc*.,’ (Ṛgveda, 9.1.1) and
ending with ‘*yatte rājañchṛtam haviḥ, etc*.’ (9.114.4).

The ‘*Anugamana* of the cows’ does not mean merely *following* them, but
*attending* on them; and the exact form of this is to be ascertained
from the description of the expiation for ‘cow-killing.’—(257)
