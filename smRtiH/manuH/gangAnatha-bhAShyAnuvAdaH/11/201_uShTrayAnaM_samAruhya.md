‘*Uṣṭra-yāna*’ is a cart to which a camel is yoked.

Riding on the camel itself would involve a heavier expiation,—in the
shape of the repetition of ‘Breath-control.’

‘*Digvāsā*’—naked.

For the atonement of the offence of being naked, the man should bathe
along with his clothes, and then perform the ‘Breath-suppression.’—(201)
