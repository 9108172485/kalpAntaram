The giving of gifts has been laid down for all castes, as fulfilling
man’s purpose, by leading men to heaven. The present text sets forth
rules regarding gifts to be made by the king.

If the king is possessed of much wealth, he ‘*shall bestow on*,’—give
to, make accept—‘*Brāhmaṇas, all kinds of jewels*’—pearls and the
rest—‘*according to their desert*,’—in accordance with the learning and
character of each man;—‘*also* *presents for sacrificial
performances*;’—this has been repeated with a view to showing that such
presents shall he made even for the purpose of enabling the *Brāhmaṇas*
to perform such rites as are not compulsory, but are performed with a
view to a certain reward.—(4)
