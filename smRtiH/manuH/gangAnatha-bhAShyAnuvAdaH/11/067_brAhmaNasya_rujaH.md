‘*Causing pain*.’—Inflicting physical suffering with a stick or with the
hand.

“What is it *that should not be smelt*? There is no prohibition of the
*smelling* of anything, as there is of *eating*.

Nor does it follow that what should not he *eaten* is also what should
not be *smelt*. Because butter and other things got together for
sacrificial performance are what should not he *eaten*,—and yet these
are not held to be what should not be smelt.” Our answer to this is as
follows.—Such things as garlic, onion, human excreta and the like, on
account of their foul smell, cause pain to the olfactory organ; and it
is these things that are meant; and since ‘wine’ is also mentioned in
this context, those tilings also are meant to be included the *eating*
whereof has been forbidden. But rotten wood and such things are not
meant

‘*Cheating*’—dishonesty; an unclean heart; saying one thing, doing
another and thinking of a third.—(67)
