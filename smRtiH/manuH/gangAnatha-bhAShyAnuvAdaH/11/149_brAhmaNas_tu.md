‘*Odour given out by a wine-drinker*.’—The odour that conies out of the
mouth of a person who has drunk wine, is due to its digestion undergone
in the stomach and contact with other substances therein contained;
hence the offence is a comparatively light one. The odour of wine kept
in a vessel, can be easily avoided (hence the inhaling of its odour
would be a serious offence).

Others explain the text to mean that this same expiation applies to a
case where the said odour is inhaled by a Brāhmaṇa who is habituated to
drinking wine.

‘*Who has partaken of Soma*’— This specification implies that what is
said here does not apply to the case of one who has performed the
*Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* sacrifices.

‘*Eating clarified butter*.’—Here also, the eating of other things is
not precluded.

Since ‘*wine*’ has been mentioned by name, what is said here does not
apply to the case of other *intoxicating drinks*.—(149)
