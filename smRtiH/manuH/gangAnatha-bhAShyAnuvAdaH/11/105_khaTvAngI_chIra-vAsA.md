title = "105 खट्वाङ्गी चीर-वासा"

+++
This expiation refers to a case where the crime has been committed
unintentionally, under the misapprehension that the woman was the man’s
own wife;—or when the crime is intentional, and the woman belongs to a
different caste.

‘*Rags*,’ ‘*cīra*,’—pieces of doth.

‘*With beard grown*’—letting his beard grow.

Even in a case where the woman is of the same caste, if she is an
unchaste woman, the expiation shall be a light one.—(105)
