This only refers to the ‘Twelve-year Penance,’ and not to any other of
the several expiations prescribed for the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa;—the
construction being—‘He shall perform that penance which has been
prescribed for the slayer of a Brāhmaṇa.’

‘*Who desires to remove*’—anxious to wipe off; desirous of
purification.—(101)
