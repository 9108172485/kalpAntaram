This is the praise of knowledge; and what we learn from this section of
the text is that for the learned man purification is secured by a
comparatively light expiation.

‘*Knowledge*’—here means what is contained in the Veda, along with the
esoteric explanations. Mere *knowledge* of the rules of Expiation cannot
bring about purification. If it did, there would be no possibility of
any one actually performing the rite. As for the knowledge of the real
nature of gods and other things, and the knowledge of purely esoteric
matters,—since this also is not acquired for any selfish purpose, it is
only right that it should be destructive of sins. To this sense it has
been declared—‘Just as water does not touch the lotus-leaf, so does sin
not contaminate the man who knows this.’—(*Chāndogya Upaniṣad*, 4.14.3).

‘*Fuel*’—wooden sticks.

Just as dry wood thrown into fire is quickly consumed, so does knowledge
destroy all sins;—the only ground of similarity lying in there being
*destruction* in both cases.

‘*Learned in the Veda*.’—This serves to qualify the *knowledge*
specially meant; so that the knowledge of Logic, Arts, Poetry and such
subjects becomes excluded.—(246)
