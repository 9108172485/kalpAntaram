People explain this verse to mean that the Agnihotra should not be
performed with the wealth obtained from Śūdras, as a friendly present.
The prohibition does not apply to the carrying on of such compulsory
rites as have been already undertaken. It has been declared that ‘one
should not perform sacrifices after having begged wealth from Śūdras,
there is no harm, however, if the wealth is given *unasked*, and is used
for the carrying on of a rite already commenced.’ Further it is only
*making* a *living* by receiving gifts from improper persons that has
been forbidden; while the performance of the compulsory rites by such
means has been permitted. From all this the present verse is understood
to be the prohibition of only the single rite of ‘Fire-laying’;
specially because the text mentions simply ‘the wealth of the Śūdra,’
and does not make any such distinction as between what is obtained *by
begging* and what is obtained *unasked*. If the prohibition pertained to
*all rites*, then, since the prohibition would have been secured by the
present verse, there would be no point in the prohibition of ‘begging’
contained in Verse 24.—(42)
