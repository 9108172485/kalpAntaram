This verse applies to all castes.

‘*Who always acquires*’—who always goes on acquiring wealth by
agriculture, by receiving gifts, by money-lending and so forth;—‘*and
never gives*.’

‘*If* *he refuses to give up the thing*’— then other methods should be
employed.

‘*Who never gives*’—may he taken to mean ‘who is of a miserly
disposition.’—(15)
