‘*Vows*’—are understood to be those laid down in connection with Vedic
study. But this is not right; since those vows have been laid down with
a view to proper *study*, and hence there could be no possibility of
their coming in on the occasion of Re-initiation. \[So that the rule
declaring their omission would be redundant\] Hence the ‘vows’ in the
present context should be understood to be those that are set before the
student in such words as—‘Do not sleep during the day,’ ‘Fetch fuel in
the morning and in the evening,’ ‘Be obedient to the Preceptor,’ and so
forth. It is these that are omitted on the Re-initiation.—(151)
