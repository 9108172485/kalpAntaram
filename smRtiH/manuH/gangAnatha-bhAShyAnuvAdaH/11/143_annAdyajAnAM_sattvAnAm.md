The creatures or living beings that are bred in cooked rice, and other
kinds of food kept for a long time.

‘*Bred in sauces*’—such as molasses, gruel and so forth.

The insects inside figs and such others are those ‘*bred in fruits and
flowers*.’

‘*Eating with clarified butter*’—that is, when one begins to take his
food, he should drink clarified butter;—the particle ‘*pra*’ in
‘*prāśa*’ denoting *beginning*. Hence what is laid down does not exclude
owlinary food, as is done in the case of the ‘*Payovrata*’ (subsisting
on milk) and other penances; and the reason for this lies in the
consideration that the creatures concerned are so insignificant that
mere ‘breath-control’ has been prescribed as the expiation for killing
them; so that the expiation in question (if it meant subsisting on
clarified butter *only*) would be too heavy for such a trifling offence.
Hence what is meant by ‘eating with clarified butter’ is that just a
little of it should he sipped in the beginning.—(143)
