+++
(*a*) Intercourse with the Preceptor’s wife, (*b*) Theft, and (*c*)
Association with outcasts,—these are ‘*heinous offences*’ for all
castes;—‘wine-drinking’ is so only for the Brāhmaṇa.

^(‘)*Theft*’—stands here for the stealing of gold belonging to a
Brāhmaṇa; as is clear from another Smṛti text, which says that—‘The
stealing of Brāhmaṇa’s gold constitutes a *heinous offence*.’ The term
‘*pātaka*’ (offence) literally signifying ‘that which degrades,’ is
applied to all transgressions, major as well as minor, and, in the name
‘*mahā-pātaka*,’ the qualifying epithet ‘*mahā*’ is meant to indicate
the great seriousness of the offence.

‘*Association with these*’—with any one of them; details regarding this
are going to be described under 180 below.—(54)
