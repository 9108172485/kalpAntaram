‘*Club*’—a particular kind of stick, made of iron or wood.

‘Once,’ ‘*himself*’—both of these are meant to be emphasised.

‘*Becomes purified by death*.’—The man shall be struck only; it does not
matter whether or not he dies by it; he becomes purified by the stroke
of the club.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa by penance*’—as described below. Here also stress is not
meant to be laid upon the term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*.’ It is for this reason that
the next verse contains the term ‘*twice-born person*’ (in general).

Though the stealing of *Kṛṣṇala* (grains of gold, used at certain
sacrifices) is a serious crime, yet, what is here laid down should be
understood as pertaining to the stealing of a hundred gold-pieces. It
has been explained that *punishment* and *expiation* proceed on the same
lines; and, in connection with punishments, it has been said that
‘*death* shall be the penalty when *more than a hundred* gold-pieces
have been stolen’ (8.321); hence the expiation here put forward should
also be taken as pertaining to the stealing of the same quantity.

As regards the assertion that the thief becomes pure by death, it is
understood to be based upon the passage—‘For him the King shall take up
a weapon made of Udumbara wood, and kill him with it, and he becomes
pure by that death.’ And this refers to a case where the stealer is a
Kṣatriya or one lower still, and the owner is a highly qualified person.

When, however, the man is prepared to die, he may be made to refund what
he has stolen and smeared with butter, live upon cow-dung (?).—(100)
