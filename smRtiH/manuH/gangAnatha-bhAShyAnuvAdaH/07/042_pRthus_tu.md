‘*The son of Gadhi* (*Gādhi*?) *attained Brāhmaṇahood*.’—

*Objection*—“*In* connection with the subject of Kings and kingdoms,
where was the occasion for citing an instance of the attaining of
*Brāhmaṇahood?* It was necessary to cite cases of the obtaining of
kingdoms only, as was done in the first half of the verse.”

Our answer is that as a matter of fact a higher caste is more difficult
to attain than sovereignty over riches; because the higher caste carries
with it all its privileges.

*Objection*—“But how can, *vinaya*, discipline, be the cause of that?
‘Discipline’ consists in such qualifications as—the proper employment of
the six means of success, alertness, thrift, non-avariciousness, freedom
from evil habits, and so forth; and not one of these can be the cause of
bringing about Brāhmaṇahood. In fact Austerity has been declared to be
the cause of that, in such texts as—‘Viśvāmitra practised austerities
with the view that he may not remain the son of a non-sage’ and so
forth.”

Our answer is as follows:—The ‘*Naya*’, ‘conduct’, here spoken of (as
‘*Vinaya*’, ‘discipline’), is not what has been described in the Science
of Politics; it is what has been enjoined in the scriptures and is
observed in ordinary practice; and in the scriptures it has been laid
down that ‘by means of Austerity, the higher caste is attained during
another life’; while in the case of Viśvāmitra, Brāhmaṇahood was
attained during the same life in which he was a *Kṣatriya*, as has been
described in the books.—(42)
