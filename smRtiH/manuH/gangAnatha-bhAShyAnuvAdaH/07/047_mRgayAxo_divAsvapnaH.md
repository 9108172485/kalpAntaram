Killing of animals for purposes of the chase is ‘*Hunting*’.

‘*Dice*’—Gambling with dice. That these two lead to evil consequences is
well known.

‘*Sleeping during the day*’.—*i.e*., not acting at the time at which a
certain action should be done. The term ‘*divā*’ here does not stand for
the *day* only; this same idea being expressed elsewhere by means of the
phrase ‘sleeping at the time of waking.’

Or, the term may betaken in its literal sense; sleeping during the day
is positively prohibited, and it stands in the way of all business. This
habit causes disappointment to men who want an interview with the king,
and also to others; and as such becomes, a source of discontent among
the people.

‘*Censoriousness*’—the criticising of other people’s faults in private.
This displeases all men. As for the blaming of persons who do not
deserve it, this is itself constitutes a sin.

‘*Women*’, ‘*intoxication*’—the fact of these two being evils is well
known. ‘*Musical triad* *i.e*., dancing, singing and instrumental music.

‘*Listless wandering*’—walking about hither and thither, other for no
purpose, or for a wicked purpose.

‘*Tenfold*’—which are ten in number.

‘*Arising from the love of pleasure*’, ‘*Kāma*—‘*Kama*’ is desire, from
which they arise;—or they arise from a particular kind of pleasure;—or
‘*Kāmya*’ may mean *arising from* *a* *particular experienced
object*.—(47).
