Here ‘*place*’ stands for the ‘right place’, which is that which is
other than the village inhabited by the giver himself; people away from
their homes are likely to be subject to many inconveniences and wants,
which may he removed by the gift;—‘*Time*’—when some one who is
performing a sacrifice happens to run short of necessary supplies; or
when an eclipse takes place; ‘*Form*’—the pouring of water, the
pronouncing of the syllable ‘*Svasti*’ by the recipient, the proper
preparation of the substance given away, the sweetness of disposition
with which the gift is made; and so forth;

‘*Substance*’— cow, land, gold and so forth.

‘*Faith*’—a keen desire for fulfilment, the determination as to ‘how
this may be accomplished.’

‘*After death*.’—This only indicates that the reward does not always
follow immediately after the act of giving; it does not mean that it
accrues always during the next life; specially as all that is meant in
the case of all acts enjoined in the Veda is that they must bring their
reward (and nothing is indicated regarding the time at which the reward
is to accrue).—(86)
