When he is pleased at service rendered to him, he grants wealth; when he
is angry, he inflicts death. Hence he who desires wealth should serve
him with care. When he is pleased with a man, he does not merely bestow
wealth on him, but also subdues and destroys his enemies. For this
reason also, if a man desires the destruction of his enemy, he should
try to please the King.

‘*Padma*;’—though this term is synonymous with ‘*Śri*’ (a name of the
Goddess of Fortune, yet in the present text it has been used in the
sense of *greatness*; t he sense being that the King bestows large
wealth.

All these things are obtained from the King, because ‘*he contains in
himself the splendour of all*’—*i.e*., of the Sun, the Moon and
Fire.—(11)
