Even though the Accusative case-ending has been used, yet the singular
number (in ‘*purohitam*’, ‘priest’) should be regarded as significant;
specially as the singleness of the household priest has been declared
elsewhere also; the present construction being analogous to that in the
case of such sentences as ‘he cuts *a post*’, ‘one should obtain *a
wife*’, and so forth.

‘*He* *shall select officiating priests*’—The exact number of these
should be ascertained from Vedic texts. Their qualifications arc—‘They
should be neither too fat nor too lean, neither too tall nor too short,
neither too old nor too young, having at least six ancestors on both
sides famed for learning, austerity and actions, their Brāhmaṇa-hood
should be above suspicion and they should themselves be learned’; and so
forth.

‘*Domestic rites*’—those that are performed for the allaying of evil
portents and for the securing of welfare.

‘*Fire sacrifices*’—sacrificial rites performed in connection with the
Three Fires.—(78)
