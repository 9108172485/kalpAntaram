‘*Thoroughly tested*’—examined by means of tests, as regards their
character, honesty and behaviour;—‘*women*’—maids, maid-servants ‘*with
fans, water and incense’—by* means of these,—‘*shall serve him*’—attend
upon him; and they shall have taken, their baths and performed toilets
carefully;—‘*attentively*’—not having their minds diverted elsewhere.

‘*Toilet and ornaments examined*’,— every possibility of tricks of
toilet in regard to nails, hairs and the like being thoroughly examined;
sometimes weapons may be concealed, in these, by means of which they
might strike the king without the least hindrance. The ‘*ornaments*’
have to be examined, because these may be besmeared with poison, and
with these they might touch the king’s person.—(219)
