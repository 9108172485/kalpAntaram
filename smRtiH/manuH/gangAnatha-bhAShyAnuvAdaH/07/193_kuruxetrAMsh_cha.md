‘*Kurukṣetra*’—is well known.

‘*Matsya*’—is the name of the *Virāṭa* country, near Nāgapura.

‘*Pañcāla*’—includes both the Kānyakubja and the Ahiccatra.

‘*Born in Śūrasena*’—*i.e*., in Mathurā.

Some of these words are denotative of origin; but the necessary affix
has been dropped:

The people of these countries are mostly huge-bodied, powerful,
broad-chested, brave, proud, irrepressible; and as such, when placed at
the forefront of the battle, strike terror is the hearts of the enemies.

From among the people of other countries those have to be similarly
stationed who are ‘*tall*’—,and having large bodies, are endowed with
long breaths. Those that are ‘*light*’ are fearless, on account of being
comparatively free from danger, being hidden by others and without being
struck themselves, continue to strike and thus, without suffering
injury, set an example to others—(193).
