A man who, by his very nature, is ‘*guileless*’, in matters relating to
duty, wealth and pleasures, is ‘*hard to find*,’ can be met with
difficulty. In fact, it is ‘*by punishment*’ that a man is ‘*kept under
control*’, kept firm in the right path; through fear of it, he does not
give free vent to his desires.

‘*The world subserves etc*.’—This has been already explained (under
15).—(22)
