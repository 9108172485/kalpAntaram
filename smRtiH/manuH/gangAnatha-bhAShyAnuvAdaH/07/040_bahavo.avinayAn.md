What has been stated above is further emphasised by means of the next
three verses.

Undisciplined kings, have perished ‘*along with their belongings*’.
‘*Belongings*’ stand for the son, wife, elephants, horses and so forth.

On the other hand, those who are disciplined never lose their kingdom,
after having got it; in fact even when living far off in the forest, and
hence devoid of any treasure &c., they have obtained kingdoms.’—(40).
