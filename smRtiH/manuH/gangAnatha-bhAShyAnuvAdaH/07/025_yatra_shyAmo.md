These two are most praiseworthy for men (?). The author eulogises
punishment by means of an imaginary metaphor.

Punishment is of two kinds—one kind inspires fear, and another brings
pain; the former is indicated by the ‘*dark completion*’ and the latter
by the ‘*red eyes*’.

The praise of punishment has been furnished.

Punishment should be inflicted, but with due consideration of the
exigencies of time, place &c. Apart from this all else is purely
commendatory.

‘*Provided that the governor*—he who metes out the punishment
—‘*discerns rightly*’; *i.e*., rules over the people after due
consideration of time, place &c.;—‘*the people are not misled*’— do not
become affected by any evil.—(25).
