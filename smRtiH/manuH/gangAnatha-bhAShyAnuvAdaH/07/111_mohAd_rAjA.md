+++
If a King, not making the aforesaid discrimination, happens, ‘*through
Jolly*’, and ‘*thoughtlessly*’, to ‘*oppress his kingdom*’—by employing
force,—‘*he becomes deprived of his kingdom*’—by the ill-feeling of his
subjects,—‘*and also of his life*’; *i.e*., he is slain even by single
men, who happen to be possessed of daring and unmindful of their own
life.—(111)
