‘*Pure*’—not covetous.

‘*True to his word*’—who attaches great importance to truth; who, in all
his acts, places truth in the fore-front; which means that he has his
senses under control; for how can there be any truthfulness in one whose
senses are not subdued?

‘*Who acts according to the Law*’,—‘*who has good assistants* whose
assistants are properly qualified; *i.e*., assisted by such assistants
as are not illiterate, and who are devoted to him.

‘*Wise*’—intelligent;—this is the reverse of the ‘demented’ person
mentioned in the preceding verse.

Thus he who is equipped with these five qualities, and free from the
corresponding five contrary qualities, is the person entitled to
administer punishment, and to partake of the visible (physical) and
invisible (moral) results proceeding therefrom. Such is the sense of
these two verses.—(31).
