It should not be thought that ‘if the man is killed after having turned
back, he does not die after having committed a sinful deed’; because the
offence lies in his having *turned back*. Further, the man should not
entertain the notion that ‘by becoming wounded I have repaid my debt to
the master; and have fulfilled my duty towards him’; because such wounds
serve no useful purpose at all. This is what is indicated by pointing
out the gravity of the offence involved. What is said in the present
verse regarding the master’s sins falling upon the servant, as also what
follows in the next verse regarding the master taking off the merit of
the servant,—all this is purely commendatory; for the acts of one man,
either good or bad, cannot accrue to another; nor can there be a total
annihilation of a meritorious act. All that is possible is that, when
there is an obstruction caused by a grievous sin, the fruition of the
meritorious act is delayed. This is all that is meant in the present
context.—(94)
