The King shall be kept pleased, not so such with a view to obtaining
desirable things from him, as for saving oneself from trouble; this is
what is reiterated by the text.

He who is hostile to the King,—*i.e*., acts against him—‘*he doubtlessly
perishes*’; ‘*because, for his quick destruction*.’ *etc*.—Other men may
forgive a fault, on account of the difficulties involved in complaining
of it to the King; which involves expenditure of money, where
difficulties crop up again and again by reason of the freaks of
witnesses and so forth; but in the case of the King himself, there is no
such difficulty; and when once he makes up his mind to destroy a man,
the man is surely ruined; the King being all-powerful; and further, if
he were to appear like making special efforts for chastising such a man,
this (show of weakness) would militate against his puissance (?).—(12).
