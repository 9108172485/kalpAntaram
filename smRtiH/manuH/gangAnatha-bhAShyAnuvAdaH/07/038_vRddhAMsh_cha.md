‘*Elderly*’—aged—Brāhmaṇas. This alone is something new enjoined here;
all the rest of it, ‘Brāhmaṇas’ and so forth, is what has been already
declared before.

‘Pure’—free from defects. This also is something new; the meaning being
that ‘purity’ is as good a reason for being honoured as ‘knowledge and
learning.’

The second half of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*By Rākṣasas*’—As a rule, *Rākṣasas* are pitiless, very powerful and
devoid of all virtues; and yet. even these honour the person who waits
upon elderly men.—(38).
