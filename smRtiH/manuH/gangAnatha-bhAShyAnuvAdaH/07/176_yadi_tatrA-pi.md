If even in that seeking of refuge he should
‘*perceive*’—feel—‘*something wrong on the part of his shelterer*’; &c.
&c. The signs indicating such ‘wrong’ are the following:—

‘Repentance after having given the shelter, *Kṛtapurvahomam* (?),
showing disrespect, describing misdeeds, inattention, disagreeable
speech,—these are the acts of the unfavourable man,

Thus when the shelterer is found to be unfavourably inclined,—although
the shelterer be, in reality, free from anything actually wrong,—this is
what is implied by the term ‘*api*’, ‘*even*—at such a time he shall,
without any hesitation, have recourse to war. Nor is it necessary that
the man should suffer destruction after having been reduced to a
condition necessitating his taking shelter; because even a stronger man
is sometimes found to be defeated by the weaker. In any case, the final
result is bound to be favourable: if he wins, he regains his kingdom, if
he is defeated, he is sure to attain heaven. We are going to show later
on the excellence of war.

From among the six ‘measures of policy’ the king may resort to one or
the other, and regulate his marches according to his capacity.—(176)
