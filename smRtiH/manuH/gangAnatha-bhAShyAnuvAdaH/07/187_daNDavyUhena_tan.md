When the army is arranged in the shape of a staff, it is said to be
‘*arrayed in the form of* a *staff*’; similarly when in the shape of the
cart, it is ‘arrayed in the *form of a cart*’; and so on with the rest.

\(A\) In the fore-front, there is the Commander of the entire
force,—then the king in the centre,—then the army-commander,—on his two
flinks, the elephants,—close to them the horses,—then the footsoldiers;
the whole of this army being, like the staff and operating in a straight
line.

\(B\) Operating on both sides is the ‘*needle-array*’, in which the
soldiers operate in a solid mass, the bravest being in the forefront; it
constitutes a very much-lengthened line, all operating simultaneously.

\(C\) The ‘*alligator-array*’ is broad at the front face and at the two
flanks (thighs), and highly recommended; as nowhere in this array is
there any weak point; and even when pressed by braver enemies, it leads
to the breaking up of the enemy’s forces; and in the end its purpose is
entirely and surely accomplished. The rest of the army is to be thrown
into the middle of the array.

The above-mentioned dispositions of the army ore to by resorted to in
accordance with the end in view; on even ground the advance should be
made either in the ‘staff’ or the ‘needle’ or the ‘*garuḍa*’ array; but
on uneven ground, and on ground beset with obstructions, etc. that of
the ‘cart’ or the ‘alligator’ or the ‘boar’.—(187)
