Conciliation and the rest having failed,—even though victory be
uncertain, and equally possible for both combatants,—he shall fight in
such a manner that his victory become certain; and if he wins, he gains
a kingdom, while if he is slain, he gains heaven; so in either case
victory would be his. He shall not create imaginary difficulties, and he
shall also eschew all treacherous ways of fighting, as also all such
operations as would bring about either the utter annihilation of the
enemy or too much harassment. Says Vyāsa—‘O Arjuna, even Indra himself
dare not stand before men who have become desperate and given up all
hope of their lives’. When victory appears to be doubtful, retreat is
the proper thing to do; for when life has gone out, the man is unable to
accomplish his purpose; it is only while alive that he passes through
pleasing experiences, whereas if he dies, he only gains heaven.—(200).
