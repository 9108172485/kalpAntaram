Presents of gold and other things with a view to secure the good will of
both parties constitute ‘*alliance*’; and the opposite of this is
‘*War*’;—going forward with a single purpose is ‘*March*’;—ignoring of
the enemy leads to ‘*Halt*’;—putting forward terms of peace as well as
of war constitutes ‘*Bifurcation*’;—and the surrendering of oneself to
another is ‘*Seeking Shelter*’. These are the six ‘measures of policy’;
and from among these he shall have recourse to that one by means of
which, he feels, he would be enabled to erect fortifications, capture
elephants, dig mines, carry on trade, cut down forests, raise
embankments round fields in tracts not irrigated by rain, to win the
wealth of other people, and so forth.—(160)
