Though the subjugation of the senses has been already enjoined among the
‘Duties of Students’ as beneficial for all men, yet it is again
reiterated among the ‘Duties of Kings’ with a view to indicate that this
forms an important factor in their training.

This is what is meant by the words—‘he *whose senses are subjugated* &c.
&c.’ It is a fact well known to all men that one whose senses are not
subdued does not succeed in keeping his subjects under control.

‘*Effort*’—intense exertion.

‘*Day and night*’—Daring the day as well as during the night.—(44)
