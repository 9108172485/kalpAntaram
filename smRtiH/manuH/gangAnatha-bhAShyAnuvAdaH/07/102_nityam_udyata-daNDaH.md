He who has his force operative, is called ‘*Udyatadaṇḍaḥ*’; *i.e*.,
having his force in operation. For instance, the elephants and other
constituents of the army he shall train by constant exercise; *i.e*.,
they shall all be disciplined by being regularly driven and trained; the
exercise shall be regular; their clothing and accoutrements shall be
kept in train. This is what is meant by the force being ‘operative’; if
this is done, it shows to the people in his kingdom that he is equipped
with prowess and energy.

Similarly he shall have ‘*his manliness displayed*’; he should show,
render manifest, his powers; *i.e*., at boundary-posts, and forests he
should keep watch-men, imbued with courage, fully armed and armoured.

‘*His secrets ever concealed*’;—he shall determine what should be
concealed, and then keeping that to himself, he shall conceal it, with
due care by guarding it against prying and thwarting by others.

He shall always follow up the weak points of his enemies; shall find out
their intentions and try to thwart them.—(102)
