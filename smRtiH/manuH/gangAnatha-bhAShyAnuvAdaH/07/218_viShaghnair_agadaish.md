‘*All his things*’— all such things as clothes and the like that are to
be used by the king,—‘*he shall purify by means of liquids destructive
of poisons*’

‘*Such gems as are antidotes against poison*’—*e.g*. the gem on the
snake’s hood, which may have been thrown ont of the month of the
Garuḍa-bird.

‘*Careful*’—he should never miss it.

‘*Always*’— at times other than that of eating also.—(218)
