The present section is taken up for the purpose of indicating the
necessity of associating assistants with one’self (one’s self?).

A King who is not helped by assistants, in the shape of able
councillors, army-commanders, administrators of justice,—all which are
going to be described,—cannot justly administer punishment alone by
himself; even though he be fully endowed with all necessary qualities of
justice and expediency. ‘Justice’ consists in decision that is in due
accordance with Law and is in keeping with the peculiarities of time,
place &c.

For this reason it is necessary for the King to employ properly
qualified assistants.

The meaning is that punishment cannot be justly administered by the King
without assistants,—just as it cannot be administered by one who is
foolish or demented, or whose mind is not properly trained, or who is
addicted to sensual objects, or is avaricious—and hence confiscates
people’s property in an unjust manner. It can be rightly administered
only by persons possessed of qualities that are tṇe reverse of
these.—(30).

This same idea is expressed obversely in the next verse.
