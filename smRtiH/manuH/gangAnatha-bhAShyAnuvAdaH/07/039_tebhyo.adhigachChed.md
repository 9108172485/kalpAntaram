The use of waiting upon elderly men is next described,

‘*From them*’—from the learned *Brāhmaṇas—‘he shall learn
discipline*’—the proper kingly behaviour.

‘*Though his mind be already disciplined*’;—though he may be already
disciplined by his own will, or by the proper study of political
science,—yet he should carefully attend to the advice of elderly
persons; because men with practical experience are better experts than
those possessing only theoretical knowledge. Or even though highly
trained, he shall train his mind under elderly qualified men, for the
purpose of making his aptitude keener. Just as gold, even though pure by
its nature, becomes purer and brighter to look at when it undergoes
purification by being put in lire.

The reward of this discipline is that the King never perishes—(39)
