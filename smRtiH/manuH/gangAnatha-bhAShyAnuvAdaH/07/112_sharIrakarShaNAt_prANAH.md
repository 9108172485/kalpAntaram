In his own kingdom the King should very carefully cultivate the good
feelings of his people; since the kingdom occupies the position of body
in relation to the King; when the body becomes emasciated by such causes
as the eating of indigestible and unwholesome food and the like, the
life goes out of it; similar results follow from the oppression of the
Kingdom.
