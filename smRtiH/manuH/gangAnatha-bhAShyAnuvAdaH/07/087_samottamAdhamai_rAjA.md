War has been enjoined as the last resource for the king, when -all other
means nave failed; and when once war has been entered into and the king
has reached the battle-field, and has been challenged by his enemy,—he
shall not show any sort of indifference; this is what is meant by the
present verse; which means that he shall not entertain any such notion
as—‘I shall not strike at a weak enemy.’

Or, when robbers and others, in sheer disregard for the established law,
attack the people,—or join the king’s enemies,—if such persons cannot be
subdued without war,—then the king must go to war with them, even though
they be weak. Though in a case like this, the king is not actually
‘challenged’ by the robbers in so many wards, yet, for all practical
purposes, he is as good as ‘challenged’.

It is ‘*the duty of the Kṣatriya*’ that whenever he is challenged, he
must fight, whoever the challenger may be, and he shall take no account
of the caste or age or training or ambition etc. of the other party.
This duty the King has to bear in mind.—(87)
