‘*The attainment*’,—bringing together—‘*of these, mutually
irreconcilable*’—*i.e*., *of morality, pleasure and wealth*,—or of the
*ministers*;—‘*the giving away of daughters*’;—all this should be
deliberated upon, in connection with the success of his business; also
the ‘*guardianship of his sons*’, the princes.

The princes should be made to accept morality and wealth, by the king
saying such words be ‘I am your own’. When they come by money for the
first time, they spend it just as they happen to be advised, and they
generally waste it; and evil-minded men take from them whatever they ask
for;—if they happen to associate with wicked men, they imbibe their
character; and being thus poisoned with evil tendencies, they cannot be
kept away from vices; for, as has been said—‘it is impossible for the
colour of saffron to be put upon a cloth already tinged with blue’. For
this reason the princes have to be constantly instructed. Among them
again, those that are possessed of better qualities should receive
advancement; the others receiving comparatively little for their share.
The eldest of them, who is highly qualified and free from jealousies,
should be installed as heir-apparent. In this manner the king shall
always take care to guard the princes.—(152)
