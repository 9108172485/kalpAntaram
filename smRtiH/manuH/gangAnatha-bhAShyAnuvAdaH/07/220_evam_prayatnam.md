‘*Similar*’—*i.e*. as regards the removal of poison. &c.—‘*caution, he
shall exercise*’.

The ‘*bath*’ referred to here is the full bath when the head is washed
with such perfumes as the *Rocana* (the yellow pigment obtained from the
bile of the cow) and the like.

The ‘*seat*’ has been mentioned here by way of illustration; the sense
being that he should exercise the same caution with regard to the
conveyance and other things that he does while seated on a carefully
prepared seat.—(220)
