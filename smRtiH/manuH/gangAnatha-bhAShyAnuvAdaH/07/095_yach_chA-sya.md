Whatever merit the man may have, all that his master takes off.

‘*Earned for the next world*.’—This shows that there is some purpose
served. The term ‘*amutrārtham*’ is formed with the ‘*ach*’ affix,
according to the rule governing the ‘*arshas* group’. The meaning
is—‘what has been earned for some purpose to be fulfilled in the next
world, becomes lost (nullified) for him’.

Or, the compound may be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*—‘that whose purpose
or use pertains to the next world’. This explanation would be justified
by the sense and also by its usefulness.—(95)
