Having entered into alliance with one party, he shall declare war upon
another, even under false pretences. Similarly he shall resort to
Halting after having entered into alliance and declared war. All this he
shall do after having fully considered his business. There can be no
fixed time for all this; he shall resort to a certain measure at the
time at which he may think it to be most opportune.

there be any teaching regarding the subject at all?”

*Answer*—Who says that the time *cannot* be indicated? What is meant is
that any minute details regarding the time are hard to indicate; a
general indication is easy enough; and even a general indication comes
useful to those who are not learned.—(161)
