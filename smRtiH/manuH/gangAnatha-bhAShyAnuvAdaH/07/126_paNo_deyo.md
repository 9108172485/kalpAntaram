To the ‘*inferior servant*’—*i.e*., to one who is employed in such work
as sweeping and cleaning; for his living one *paṇa* should be paid.

To the superior servant shall also be given *Clothing every sixth
month*’; and also ‘a *Droṇa of grain*’; a ‘*droṇa*’ is equal to four
*Ādhakas*.

The exact measure of the ‘*paṇa*’ the author is going to describe later
on (8.136).

These verses are meant to prescribe the wages of the servants.—(126)
