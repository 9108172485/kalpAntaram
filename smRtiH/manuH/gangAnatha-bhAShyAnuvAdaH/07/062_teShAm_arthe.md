‘*Arthe*’, ‘*work relating to finance*’,—*i.e*., offices prataining
(pertaining?) to income and expenditure. In these he shall employ those
who are ‘*honest*’—not covetous of wealth.

Some of these financial offices are indicated by example ‘*mines and
stores*’;—‘*mines*’ are places where gold, silver and other precious
metals are dug out and cleansed, and ‘*stores*’ consist of food-grains,
cotton, seeds and so forth.

‘*In the inferior of the palace*’;—*i.e*., the inner apartments, the
kitchen, the bed-room and the ladies’ apartments.—In these he shall
appoint ‘*timid*’ persons. Because brave persons, if won over by his
enemies, might kill the king, when he may be alone.

All of these should be ‘*expert*’; they are energetic and, not minding
any opposition, never allow their master’s work to suffer.—(62)
