citizens and other people—‘they do not wish to be governed in such and

he mild-tempered, and happy in his family-surroundings;—and then
conclude a treaty with the king thus set up along with his assembled
subjects and ministers;—the terms of the treaty being—‘you and I shall
have equal shares in your income, you shall consult me in all that you
do or not do, at the proper time you shall come and help me with your
treasury and force’ and so forth.—(202).
