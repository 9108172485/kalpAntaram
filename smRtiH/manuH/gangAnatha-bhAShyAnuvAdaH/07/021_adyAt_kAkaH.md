Even such low animals as the crow, the dog and the like would vie with
the gods; and they would come to eat the sacrificial cake and other
offering-materials that should have been offered to the gods;—it they
were not prevented from all this by means of punishment.

Further, ‘the *rights of ownership*’—the relation of possessor and
possessed—would not remain,—even between father and son, or between
husband and wife; the husband would cease to be the husband of the wife,
and women would go about independently by themselves.

‘*Confusion among the high and low*’;—the ‘low,’ *e.g*., the *Caṇḍāla*
and the rest, would become ‘high’; and the ‘high’, *e.g*., the
*Brāhmaṇa* and others, would become ‘low’, succumb to inferiority;
Śūdras would come to preach the law, and the Vedic law would cease to be
obeyed.—(21).
