‘*Revenue*’—the tux, in the shape of the sixth part of the produce of
grains.

*By trusted men*’—by men who have been tested by means of tests.

‘*He shall stick to the scriptures*’— as detailed above. That is, he
shall have recourse to such sciences of reasoning &c. as depend mostly
upon the scriptures. Or, it may mean that he shall receive only such
part, of the produce as ‘tax’ as may be sanctioned by established usage,
never more than that.

‘*Towards the people he shall behave like a father*’.— That is, he shall
behave lovingly towards those who pay the taxes, as also towards
others.—(80)
