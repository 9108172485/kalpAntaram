When a man has been attacked by a strong enemy, recouping is impossible;
what is beneficial is resorting to a fortress; and this means
garrisoning, which involves ‘bifurcation’; this has been already

circumstances, it is only the more powerful king who divides his forces,
when under difficulties.—(173)
