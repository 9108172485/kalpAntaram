That in reality is ‘*King*’;—as it is by reason of Punishment that the
King’s power holds.

That is the ‘*Man*’;—since it disregards even powerful men and brings
them under its power.

That is the ‘*Leader*’;—all business is led, managed, by it.

‘*Ruler*’—‘Ruling’ consists in the King’s commands; and these latter are
capable of controlling men only when there is Punishment; and it is in
this sense that the actual act of *ruling* has been figuratively
attributed to it.

It is like ‘*surety*’ of ‘*the Law of the Four Stages*’;—*i.e*.,
Punishment does not allow men to swerve from their duty in the same
manner as the surety does not allow the party to deviate from the
stipulated conditions.—(17)
