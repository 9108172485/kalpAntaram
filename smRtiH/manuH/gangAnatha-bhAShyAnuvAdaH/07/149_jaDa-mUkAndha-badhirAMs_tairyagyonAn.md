When he is holding counsel, the King shall remove every kind of living
being from the place; he shall send them all away from there, for fear
of his secrets leaking out.

Among *animals* also, parrots and such others often disclose secrets;
cows and horses also, under the influence of some magical art, have been
heard to have their shape transformed and thereby made carriers of good
and bad news; and we hear of such Kingly arts as those of making animals
to disappear and so forth.

The ‘idiot’ and the rest being already included under the ‘maimed’, the
separate mention of all these is analogous to the expression
‘*go-balīvarda*’ (where even though the *balīvarda*, ox, is included
under the ‘*go*’, yet it is mentioned separately; and the ‘maimed’ have
been mentioned separately with a view to preclude the notion being
entertained that ‘the maimed person, being without bands and feet,
cannot go out, he must stay locked up on, so that how could he divulge
our secret?’

Or, the verse may mean that the persons specified shall not be made
councillors, on account of the possibility of their intellect being
defective,—and hence they should not be confided in either; so that it
becomes necessary that they shall be sent away.—(149)
