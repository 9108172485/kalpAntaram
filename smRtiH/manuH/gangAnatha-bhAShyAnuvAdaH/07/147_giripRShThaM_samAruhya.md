This lays down the *place* where the council is to be held. ‘*Retiring
into solitude*’— seated in a place where there are no men.

‘*Unobserved*’;—he shall arrange it so that men may not be able to infer
that such and such a thing is going on there.

‘*Desolate*’, ‘*niśśalākam*’,—‘*śalakā*’ is *tall grass* hence the
epithet means a place where even grass does not grow, and hence there is
no possibility of any person going there.—(147)
