‘*Blinded by affection*’—he who is unduly influenced by love.

‘*Unfair*’— inclined to be irascible. The King prospers if he metes out
punishment on a friend or a foe in the same impartial spirit.

‘*Mean*’—inclined to take undue advantage.

‘*Is destroyed by that same punishment*’— either through evil passions
aroused among the people, or through some imperceptible effects.—(27).
