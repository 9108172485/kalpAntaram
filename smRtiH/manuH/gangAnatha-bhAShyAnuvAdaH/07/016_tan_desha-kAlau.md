Those ‘*who act unlawfully*,’—*i.e*., do things harmful to the
King.—*i.e*., such persons as the Chief Minister and others,—it is the
punishment to be inflicted upon such men that is described now. As
regards persons who behave unlawfully towards one another, the
punishment to be inflicted is going to be described under VIII. 126,
where it is said—‘Having ascertained the motive &c &c.’; and the present
verse also we have explained under that text. One additional factor
introduced in the present text is ‘*learning*’, which stands for *Vedic
learning*.

‘*Appropriately*’—according as each man may deserve.

‘*Mete out*’—inflict, bestow.

Punishment should be meted out after having fully considered all that is
here mentioned. If inflicted in any other way, it would bring
perceptible trouble to the King.

The two (similar) verses occurring in discourses VII and VIII differ in
the following respects—(*a*) one refers to visible (worldly) matters and
the other to invisible (super-physical) ones, and (*b*) one refers to
the King’s servants and the other to his people.—(16)
