Even apart from the seasons mentioned in the preceding verse, ‘*at other
times*’— during the rains and other seasons also,—if he thinks that his
victory is ‘*certain*’—sure to come—then ‘*he shall march forward*’—if
he has a strong force, during the rains,—has his elephants and horses in
full strength, then, by virtue of the strength of his forces, his
victory is certain.

‘*Trouble*’ for the enemy, in connection with his army and treasury &c.;
when such trouble has arisen, then he may march against him, even
irrespectively of the condition of his own forces; since the army,
suffering from its own internal troubles, becomes easily reducible; in
fact he perishes, even like a log of wood which perishes by the mere
touch of.........(?).

‘*He shall pick up a quarrel*’;—he must march forward; after having
attacked and challenged the enemy he shall advance, when he knows the
other party is in great trouble.—(183)
