‘*Those who are alienable*’—*i.e*. such members of his family as are
angry with the enemy, and desirous of obtaining bis Kingdom;—all such
‘*he shall alienate*’; *i.e*. instruct them as to what they should do.
The act of ‘alienating’ consists in estranging the dependent from his
chief and inciting him to seek his own advantage at the cost of the
latter.

Through his spies he shall also keep himself informed of the ‘*enomy’s
doings*’,—to find out all that the beleagured enemy does in the way
inciting his own soldiers and foresters in his rear, and forming
alliances with the intermedearies and neutrals.

‘*When fate is propitious*’,—when it is favourable to the besieging
king; *i.e*., when the stars and planets bear a favourable aspect, when
dreams and other omens are found to be auspicious, and when there are
other signs visible, in the form of favourable winds and so forth,—then
being ‘*determined to conquer*’ and ‘*devoid of fear*,’ he shall march
forward as before and attack various points in the enemy’s
stronghold.—(197)
