When certain persons plot against the King, the friends and relations of
such persons, as also those that seek to enter into relationship with
them, should not all be ruined,—if they are not in the secret of their
machinations; those alone shall be proceeded against who are actually
wicked, and not his relations; this is what is shown by means of the
instance of the ‘weeder.’

Though the corn and the weed grow together and are in dose touch with
one another, yet the weeder cleverly preserves the corn and plucks out
the weeds; in the same manner from among the plotters and their friends;
those alone should be punished who have actually committed the offence,
and not those who are only related to them. Thus with due discrimination
between the good and the wicked, the former shall be preserved and the
latter punished.—(110)
