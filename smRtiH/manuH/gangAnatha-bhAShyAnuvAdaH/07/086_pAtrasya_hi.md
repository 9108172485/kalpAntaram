The term ‘*pātra*’ etymologically signifies either (*a*) ‘one who saves
from sinful deeds’, or (*b*) ‘one who saves and protects
himself’;—*i.e*., the *recipient*; or the *recipient* is called
‘*pātra*’ in the same sense in which the vessel containing clarified
butter is called its ‘*pātra*’; the substance given away is deposited in
the *recipient* in the same manner in which the butter is deposited in
the vessel. This is what has been declared above (82)—“For kings this is
interminable, and has been called *Brahmic treasure*.”

The ‘*peculiar character*’ of the recipient consists in his possessing
or not possessing, proper qualifications. It is by reason of these
qualifications that rewards of gifts are obtained.

‘*Or small*.’—When the gift is mads to one who is possessed of excellent
qualifications, in the shape of character and Vedic learning, it brings
a ‘*great*’ reward, and when made to one who has no qualifications, it
brings a *small* reward.

‘*According to his own faith*.’ To this effect we have the following
text:—*(see verse 7.86b)*
