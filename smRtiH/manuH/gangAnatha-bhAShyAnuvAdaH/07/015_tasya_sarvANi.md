‘*Through fear* *of* *him*.’—As mere relationship in general is meant to
be expressed (and Punishment is not meant to be spoken of as the actual
*source* of fear), we have the Genitive (and not the Ablative) ending in
‘*tasya*’. It is through fear of Punishment that immovable beings
*Subserve (lie experiences of men*—become capable of helping in their
enjoyment, by means of flowers, fruits, shade and so forth. The
immovable being (tree) that does not bear fruit either dries up: or if
it does not dry up, it spreads all over the place and is cut up and made
into coal.

By citing the case of the ‘immovable things’ it is meant that such
should be the treatment meted out to the person who is found to be
deserving of punishment on account of his having done something wrong to
the King; that he should he punished with cutting, uprooting (total
destruction) and the like.

The mention of the ‘immovable beings’ is for the purpose of eulogising,
by its example, the Punishment; the sense being ‘Punishment is such a
thing that it is inflicted even upon immovable things, what to say of
movable ones?’—and it is not meant that Punishment is actually inflicted
upon immovable things.

‘*Do not swerve from their duty*’—*i.e*., they do not flower or fruit
out of their proper season.—(15).
