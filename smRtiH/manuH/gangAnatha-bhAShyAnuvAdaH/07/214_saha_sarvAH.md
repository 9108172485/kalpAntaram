‘*Troubles*’—misfortunes due to human as well as divine agencies; when
these appear simultaneously, in connection with what forms the
subject-matter of the present context, then, the *wise man shall employ
all the expedients*’, ‘*collectively*’—*i.e*., gifts preceded by
conciliation, dissension preceded by conciliation, fighting accompanied
by conciliation, gifts and dissension,—or gifts along with the others,
and so on. That is, he śull make use of that particular expedient which
he finds most suited to the occasion; and he shall not sit cast down
with the troubles.—(214)

How this shall be done is explained in the next verse.
