When a king is harassed by bis enemies, he seeks shelter, for the
purpose of accomplishing some useful purpose.

The ‘purpose’ to be served is the ceasing of the harassment; and for the
attaining of this purpose one should seek shelter with a powerful
supporter; *e.g*. giving up his own territory he should go over to the
realms of that supporter.

‘*Status*’.—Even though not actually harassed, he shall seek shelter
with another king for the purpose of acquiring a status; that would save
him from future harassment. The advantage that is secured is that he
acquires a status in the eyes of men who realise that ‘he has got such
and such a king for his protector, and hence cannot be harassed by
others’. The ‘seeking shelter’ for the purpose of acquiring status has
been called ‘status’, by regarding the two as co-ordinate.

‘*Vyapadeśārtham*’ is another reading, (‘for the purpose of acquiring
status’).

In answer to the question—With whom should he seek shelter?—the text has
added—‘*with noble people*’. Shelter should be sought with one of those
kings that are noble, at whose hands no ill-treatment could be feared.
The term ‘*noble*’ connotes such qualities as *capacity to protect
others from harassment*, and so forth.—(168)
