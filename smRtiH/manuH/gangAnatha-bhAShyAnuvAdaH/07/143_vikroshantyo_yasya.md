This text describes the evil arising from neglecting the watchfulness
laid down in the preceding verse.

If the king is not awake to the necessity of establishing outposts, then
his subjects are carried off by robbers, who are ever on the look out
for such loopholes; and what can the King do for the subjects? Such a
King would be as good as dead. His very living is death itself. For this
reason the King should be ever watchful.

‘*Screaming*’— crying —‘*are carried away*’;—‘*while, along with his
servants the King is looking on*.’ The evil is bound, under the
circumstances, to be simply looked upon helplessly; the King’s servants
can only look on, they cannot chase the robbers and free the people from
their clutches; all these are as good as dead.
