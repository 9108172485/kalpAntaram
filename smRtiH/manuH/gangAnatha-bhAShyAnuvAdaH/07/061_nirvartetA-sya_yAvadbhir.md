All these officials to be appointed should be well versed in the art of
deliberation, and learned.

‘*Skilful*’.—Even when there is ground for fear and bewilderment, they
retain their courage.

‘*Industrious*’—not slothful. It has been declared in the
*Adhyakṣapracāra* that—‘That king alone deserves his kingdom whose
minister is intelligent, loyal, industrious, well versed in matters
relating to virtue and wealth, pure, clever and of noble family; having
entrusted the burden of the kingdom to him, if the king gives himself to
pleasure, he does not perish; because even so his kingly duties are duly
fulfilled’.—(61)
