One should never think that the King is his relation or friend. ‘To whom
is the King ever a friend, and who are friends to the King?’ (as the
saying goes).

Under the exigencies of business, Kings treat a friend as their enemy,
or an enemy as their friend. Similarly when they feel that they are not
sufficiently strong, they condone faults; and as soon as they feel
strong enough, they destroy the culprit. Similarly he acts according to
the exigencies of time and place.

Thus ‘*for the due fulfilment of hie duty*’—*i.e*., for the
accomplishment of his business —‘*he assumes many forms*’. In a moment
he becomes a friend, and in a moment an enemy; the King never remains
uniform.

For this reason one should never trust the King; that is, either by
reason of friendship, or of kindness, or of good nature, or of sameness
of age, one should not behave towards him as an equal. He should always
be treated with caution.—(10)
