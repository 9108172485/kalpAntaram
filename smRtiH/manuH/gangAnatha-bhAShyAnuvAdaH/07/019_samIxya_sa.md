‘*Meted out*’—inflicted, set up.

‘*After due investigation*’—*i.e*., after having duly examined the
peculiarities of ‘time’, ‘place’ and other details mentioned before
(Verse 10).

‘*Makes happy*’—incites affection among the people.

When inflicted in a manner contrary to this, it does not -only fail in
its own purpose; in fact when wrongly administered, it destroys the best
interests of the people.—(19)
