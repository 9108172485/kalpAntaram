This verse adds a further reason for subjugating the senses.

One whose senses are not subdued cannot avoid the vices. ‘*Durantāni*’,
‘*Ruinous*’,—whose end is painful. In the beginning vices bring a
certain amount of pleasure, but afterwards they lead to *ruin*; hence
they are called ‘ruinous’.

Or the term ‘*durantāni*’ may mean *whose end cannot be got at*; *i.e*.,
people caught in a vice cannot escape from it.

Those that have their source in ‘love of pleasure’ are
railed^(‘)*Kāmasamuttha*’—(45)
