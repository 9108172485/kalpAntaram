Though both death and vice deprive one of every thing, yet there is this
difference between them that death deprives one of everything, only in
this world, while vice deprives him of all things in this world as well
as in heaven.

‘*The vicious man sinks down and down*’—falls into hell.

The term ‘*vicious*’ denotes excessive addiction to the aforesaid sets
of vices. Hence it is such repeated addiction that is forbidden; not
merely having recourse to them once in a way.

These vices become destructive of virtue, wealth, pleasure and life,
even in the case of ordinary men; what to say of Kings? At the same time
it would not be right to\] abandon drinking etc. entirely; nor would it
be possible; hence it is the habit that is forbidden.—(53)
