The ordinary household work of the householder,—such as looking after
cattle, house and the rest—has been regarded as ‘easy’; the same man
tends the cattle and milks the cow. But even so all this cannot be clone
by a single man; it is still more difficult if the man happens to have
no one to assist him; how can he take the cattle to graze, and at the
same time look after his wife? As for ‘*the work of the king*’, it is an
important undertaking and leads to important results; its proper
accomplishment bears important fruits, and important results accrue to
the man who fulfills it. But a single man cannot be expected to know all
the six ‘means of success’. Hence it it necessary for the king to
appoint to the several departments of state trusted assistants, who are
possessed of qualifications similar to those of the king himself.—(55)
