When Punishment is inflicted without due consideration of time, place
&c., there is destruction of the whole kingdom along with the King and
together with all animals and immovable things. Hence the King has to be
warned of this by his ministers and his people; or these latter should
leave the kingdom.

The sages and the gods are also afflicted:—the gods live upon offerings
made by the inhabitants of the earth; hence when, on account of the
disruption of the kingdom, there is no proper performance of sacrificial
acts &c., the gods and the sages are as good as ‘destroyed.’ Says the
author of the Purāṇas—

‘Whatever is done by persons of the various castes and stages, that has
been declared to be the source of maintenance for persons of divine
origin in heaven and the other regions’.

The upshot of all that has been said from the first verse to this is as
follows:—‘The kingdom has got to be ruled by a Kṣatriya of impartial
mind;—this cannot be done without punishment; hence this should be meted
out, in his own kingdom as also elsewhere, in strict accordance with the
Law, after a full investigation of the exigencies of time and place &c.,
relating to each case;—if it is inflicted otherwise, there is
destruction of both worlds.’

The rest of it all is purely a commendatory supplement.—(29)
