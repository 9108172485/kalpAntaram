The origin of the King has been described; the origin of Punishment is
now described.

‘*For his sake*’— for the due fulfilment of the purposes of the
King,—‘*the Lord*’—Prajāpati—‘*created Punishment*’.

“What purpose of the King is served by Punishment?”

The answer is as follows—It is ‘*the protector of all creatures*’;—it is
Punishment that ‘*protects*’—guards—all creatures; as without Punishment
the King cannot carry on the work of protecting the people. Thus it was
for the proper accomplishment of the kingly function that Punishment was
created.

\(a\) ‘*It is Law*, (*b*) *born of the Lord himself*, (*c*) *incarnation
of divine glory*’.—(*a*) ‘Law’ does not consist of sacrifices and gifts;
it consists of Punishment, (*b*) Nor should it be regarded as an
inferior form of Law, by reason of its depriving men of their life and
property because it is that Law which is born out of the body of the
Lord, Prajāpati, himself, (*c*) Nor is it composed of the five material
substances; it is created out of the pure^(‘)glory’ of Brahman himself.

‘*At* *fir* *st*,’—before the creation of the King himself,—(14)
