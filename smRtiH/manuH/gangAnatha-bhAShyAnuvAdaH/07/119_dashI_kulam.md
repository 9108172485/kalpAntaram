‘*Daśi*’ is the person in charge of Ten villages; so ‘*Viṃśi*’ also. The
forms of the words are Vedic.

‘*Kula*’—part of a village; known in some places as ‘*haṭṭa*’ and in
others as ‘*uṣṭa*’.

Five times this land appertains to the Lord of Ten villages; and an
entire village to the Lord of Hundred villages; and the ‘*Town*’—city,
to the Lord of a Thousand villages. The system is that the living should
be determined in accordance with the position and duties of the
officers.—(119)
