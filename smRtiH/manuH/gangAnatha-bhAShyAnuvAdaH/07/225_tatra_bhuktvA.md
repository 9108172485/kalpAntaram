‘*Kiñcit*,’ ‘*a little*’—is an Indeclinable.

‘*Musical instrument*’—such as the Flute, the Lute, the Tabor, the
Kettle-drum, the Conch and so forth;—‘*by the sound*’ of these, soft and
pleasing to the ear —‘*becoming recreated*’ ‘*he shall sleep*’—for some
time; *i.e*. pass a proper stretch of time in sleeping.—‘*Freed from
fatigue*’—*i.e*. having shaken off all physical discomforts—‘*he shall
rise*’, for attending to his affairs.—(225)
