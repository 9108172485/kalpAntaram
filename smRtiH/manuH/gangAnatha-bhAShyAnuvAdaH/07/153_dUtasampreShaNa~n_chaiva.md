He shall deliberate upon the sending of ambassadors to the king with
whom he intends to enter into alliance, or on whom he is going to
declare war.

He shell also deliberate upon the ‘*remaining details*’ of such
undertakings as have been already taken in hand,—with a view to complete
them.

Protected by a trusted body-guard, he shall enter the harem situated in
another apartment of his palace; and there he shall visit the senior and
absolutely pure and trusted queen, and not one who is not pure and free
from suspicions. For one Bhadrasena, the king’s brother, hidden in one
of the rooms and under the bed of his mother, once killed the king;—a
queen struck the king of Avanti on his abdomen with her anklet besmeared
with poison, through her association with another man; another queen
struck the King Viduratha of Sauvīra with a weapon hidden in her hair.
So all these secret places the king shall examine with care; and he
shall prohibit the association of the maids of his harem with strangers
with shaved head or with matted locks, or with maid-servants from
outside.

He shall deliberate also upon the work—the transactions—of his spies,
who may have gone to work as beggars with bowls and under other
disguises.—(153)
