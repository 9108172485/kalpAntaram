On the road there may be certain points where there may be apprehension
of molestation from persons inclined to help his-enemy; and at these
points, when marching from his preceding encampment, he shall extend his
forces to the extent of two miles or a little more; *i.e*., at these
points the army is to consist of dense masses of elephants and chariots
and cavalry extended forward and fully equipped with offensive and
defensive weapons and supplied with large quantities of food and fodder.

The ‘*lotus array*’ is that disposition of the army where the master is
stationed at the centre and his officers all round him in a circular
form. In this array he shall himself always ‘*encamp*’,—*i.e*., march
forward from a town or a village.—(188)
