The non-giving of what should he given to the new king, or to any other
person, is ‘*productive of displeasure*’; it causes displeasure; and the
giving of it is ‘*productive of pleasure*’. Both these facts are well
known;—that the giving of what is desired causes pleasure, and the
witholding of it causes pain.

^(‘)*Each is commended when done at the proper time*’;—at one time any
gift however small causes pleasure, while at another time a poor gift,
or a small one, causes no pleasure at all. Hence the seizing and giving
away of property should be done after full consideration of the
peculiarity of the time,—(204).

All that has gone before and what is going to be described below,—all
this is ‘dependent’ &c. &c. (says the next verse.)
