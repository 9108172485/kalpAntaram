‘*These*’—Indra and the other chief Gods;—‘*with the constituent
elements*’—with the particles of their Light constituting their
bodies;—*The ‘King was created*’;—hence his face becomes terrible to
look at;—‘*by his glory*’—on account of his glory.’

He was created after ‘*taking out*’ the essential constituents. The root
‘*kṛṣi*’ (in the term ‘*niṣkṛṣya*’ (in verse 4) denotes ‘*creating*’.
The Ablative (in ‘*mātrābhyaḥ*’) may be explained either on the ground
of the ‘elements’ being the permanent factor out of which the
constituents of the King are taken out. Or we may read ‘*mātrāya*’ with
the Instrumental ending (which would denote cause).—(5)
