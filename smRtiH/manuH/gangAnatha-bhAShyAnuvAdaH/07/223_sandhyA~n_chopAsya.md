Though the attending to the twilight-devotions has already been enjoined
for the three higher castes, yet it is re-iterated here, either with a
view to show that for a time the king shall desist from the business of
his people, or for the purpose of indicating the time for the next act.

‘*In an inner* room’—in secret.

‘*Persons making secret reports*’,—*i.e*. reports pertaining to secret
acts, done inside houses &c.; as also such ‘*spies*’ as may happen to
arrive at the time.

‘*Doings*’—acts; what they may have seen, heard or clone. For this
purpose all these persons shall be seen at this time.

This shall be done in such a manner that other people may not know it,
and that he may be enabled to take steps to meet the circumstances
reported to him. It has been declared that—‘whenever any business
presents itself, it shall be attended to, and not postponed; as by the
lapse of time it might become difficult, or even impossible.’—(‘223)
