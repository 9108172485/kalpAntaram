For the Ambassador the further qualification is necessary,—that he
should be able to understand ‘*hints, expressions and gestures*’. When
the Ambassador goes to another king and the latter is deliberating with
his ministers on questions of peace, there pass among them certain
signs; for instance, the Ambassador is received with studied regard, he
is confided in, his entire speeches are frequently praised. \[All these
he shall take note of.\] But of unfavourable signs he shall take no
notice.

‘*Expressions*’—bodily changes; such as dejected looks, paleness of the
face, silence, heaving of sighs, long and hot;—such bodily changes
indicate humility, and the clever ambassador infers from these that ‘the
man has fallen in some dire calamity, that is why he is pale’. On the
other hand, when the man talks glibly, his body wears a bloom, the face
is happy,—it shows that he is pleased.

‘*Honest*’—in his dealings with women; (this is necessary) since it is
through women that secrets generally become divulged and men fall into
disgrace.—(63)
