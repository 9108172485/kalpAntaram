‘*In the ease of cattle and gold*’—which are of high value—‘*the
fiftieth part shall be taken by the Ring*’.

‘*In the case of grains*’—the exact share to be taken is to be
determined in accordance with the greater or less labour involved in the
producing of each kind.

‘*Pañcāśaḥ*’—the fiftieth; the affix being ‘*tamaṭ*’. If the reading be
‘*pañcāthadbhāgah*,’ it would be similar to such expressions as
‘*dvibhāga*’ (‘two parts’) and the like; and in that case it would stand
for a totally different number (meaning ‘fifty parts’).—(130)
