The ‘cutting off of his own root’ consists in not realising taxes and
duties; and excessive taxation constitutes the ‘cutting off of the root
of others’; and as a matter of course, the latter is due to excessive
greed; and this is what is reiterated in the text.

The ‘cutting off of his own root’ causes Suffering to the King himself,
by the depletion of his treasury. From the same cause others also come
to suffer. For if a war were to break out, and the King’s finances
happened to be low, his defeat and destruc tion would be certain; and
this would constitute a great suffering for the people.

On the other hand, if the King were to realise taxes at all times of the
year, this also makes the people wretched.—(139)
