This verse describes the nature of the ground on which the army has to
operate.

On even ground, he shall fight with chariots and horses; as there is no
obstruction for them on such ground,

‘*Marshy ground*’—ground abounding in water. On such ground, if the
water is shallow, he shall fight with elephants, but with boats, if it
is deep; these can move easily on such ground.

On ground convered with trees and thickets, with bows. This includes
also such ground as is cut up with pits and ditches;—the effect of these
being the same as that of trees etc.

‘*Firm ground?*— ground free from stones, trees, creepers, pits and the
like; on such ground he shall fight with swords and such other weapons
us are held in the hand—such as the lance; since these can be used in
fighting at close quarters, which shows the fighting-capacity of the
combatants.’—(192)
