‘*Spacious*’—as large as may be necessary for the king, his sons, his
treasury, armoury, stables and other necessities.

‘*Well guarded*’—with several compartments.

Such a palace he shall get built for himself.

‘*Equipped with all* seasons’—adorned with flowers and garlands of all
seasons: thus all the seasons would be present there. The term
‘*seasons*’ stands for the *produetts* of the seasons, in the shape of
flowers, fruits etc.

If we read ‘*Sarvartugam*’—it means ‘the place where all the seasons are
present’. The sense remains the same in both cases. When a thing is
*present* in a place, the place is said to be *equipped* with it.

‘*Resplendent*’—whitewashed with lime.

‘*Supplied with water and trees*’—equipped with fountains, gardens and
parks.—(76)
