‘*There*’—in the inner apartment.

‘*Who are his own very self*’,—*i.e*. who are as watchful of his safety
as he himself would be.

‘*Who are conversant with the peculiarities of time*’— who know what
food and drink to give at what age and under what conditions.

‘*Uncorruptible*’— who cannot be alienated; thoroughly trustworthy.

‘*Servants*’—physicians and others.

The food shall be first ‘*tested*’—*i.e*. tasted by them; and then he
shall eat it.

The ‘testing’ shall be done by expert physicians by means of fire, the
partridge and such other things. If poison has been mixed with the food,
it becomes discolored upon drying, which shows its impurity; and when
poisoned food is thrown into the fire, it loses its odour, or becomes
too sour; there is a discolouring in the flame of the fire also; and if
birds are given the food, they suffer in various ways; e.g. the *Kokila*
dies at the mere sight of poisoned food; the *Jīvaka* becomes withered,
by merely looking at poison; the eyes of the *Chakora* (partridge)
become destroyed,—and the *Muṣka* (?) begins to perspire.

He shall also repeat over suspected food those sacred texts that are
believed to be destructive of poisons.—(217)
