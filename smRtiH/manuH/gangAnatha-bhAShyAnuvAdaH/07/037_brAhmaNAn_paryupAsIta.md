‘*In the morning*, *having risen*’—having left the bed and having said
the Twilight Prayers in the prescribed manner,—he shall, first of all,
grant an audience to the *Brāhmaṇas*.

‘*Waiting upon*’ stands for making them sit dose by and making enquiries
regarding their welfare.

The prefix ‘*pari*’ has been added only for the filling up of the metre.

‘*Shall follow their advice*’. If they should happen to press for a
favour for some one, their motive should not be suspected, nor should
anything wrong be done.

‘*Accomplished students of the Threefold Science*’. The aggregate of the
three Vedas is called ‘Threefold Science’: those who have studied these
are called ‘*students of the Threefold Science*’, *i.e*., those who have
studied the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda and the Sāmaveda.

‘*Learned*’—Those who know what is contained in the Vedas.

The King shall wait upon Brāhmaṇas thus qualified; and shall act up to
their behests.

‘*Accomplished*’—those who are the best, possessed of the most excellent
qualifications, among them, in regard to the said knowledge and
learning.—(37).
