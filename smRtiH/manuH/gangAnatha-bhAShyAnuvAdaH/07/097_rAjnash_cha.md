A particular detail is laid down in connection with the rule that ‘what
has been won by one man shall be taken by him.’

The soldiers shall, of their own accord, ‘*present to the king the
choice portion*’; *i.e*., they shall select their best object and
present it to the king; and they shall not take all the booty
themselves.

‘*Such is the Vedic Declaration*.’—The Vedic passage starting with the
words ‘*Indro vai vṛttram hatvā*’ (Indra having killed Vṛttra), goes on
to say—he having become great said to the Gods *present to me the choice
portion*.’ (*Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*, 3.21).

In a case where the booty has been won by the King himself, or where it
has not been won by any soldier individually, where no such distinction
is possible as ‘this village has been won by this man and that by that
man’, and where the enemy and his allies have been annihilated by all
combined,—the division among his servants is to be made by the King, in
accordance with the maxim of ‘bestowing on worthy recipients.’—(97)
