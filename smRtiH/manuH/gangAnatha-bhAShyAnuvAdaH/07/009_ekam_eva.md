The following verses are commendatory supplements to the foregoing
Injunction. Though the context deals with the ‘Duties of Kings’, yet
what is stated here applies to all men.

When a man touches fire with his hand, or goes too near the fire when it
is burning fiercely,—he is said to be ‘approaching it carelessly’; and
when he is thus careless, he becomes burnt. If, however, the King
happens to be angry, he destroys the man along with his wife, children,
relations and property. In fact; on account of the fault committed by
the master of the house, he destroys all those relations and friends
that may happen to be with the family at the time, along with all their
goods and chattels.—(9)
