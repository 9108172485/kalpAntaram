When large bodies of fish are hidden within their fortress in the water,
the heron, with a view to catch them, adopts the plan of appearing
indifferent, as if rapt in contemplation, and thereby succeeds in
getting at them; in the same manner, even things difficult of attainment
are attained by much care and attention being devoted to them. With this
idea in his mind, the King should not give up hopes regarding the things
sought to be attained.

Then again, the hare, being small of body, is capable of doubling back
in retreat even from among a host of pursuers; similarly even though
alone and helpless, having all his feudatory chiefs risen against him
and being incapable of making a stand against them, the King should
allow his enemies to enter the fortress, and then double back in
retreat, with a view to seeking refuge under a powerful ally.

Further, the wolf, with a view to seizing its prey, finding the keepers
of the sheep careless, snatches it away; in the same manner the King
shall not give up the idea of pouncing upon his enemy, under the
impression that the latter is watchful of his own safety; because the
time may come when he may be able, like the wolf, to get at him.

Lastly, the lion kills even such large-bodied animals as the elephant
and the rest, by virtue of its valour and strength; similarly the King
should not be frightened by the enemy simply because the latter has a
large army; because even a weak person, if imbued with courage,
sometimes succeeds in killing a powerful person.—(106)
