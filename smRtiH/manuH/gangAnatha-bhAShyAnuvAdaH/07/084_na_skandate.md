That the act just mentioned *must* be performed is asserted again in
another form; What is offered into the Fire is sometimes ‘*spilt*’— it
flows out, when it is poured out; sometimes it becomes spoilt—as in the
case of the cake—by becoming overburnt. Similarly it becomes ‘wasted’—in
the eyes of all cultured men—by reason of defects in the ritualistic
detail. None of these defects is possible in the case of what is given
to Brāhmaṇas.

It is in view of this that the text asserts that this is ‘*superior to
the Fire-offerings*’—*i.e*. to the offerings poured into fire. Or, the
term ‘*Agnihotra*’ may be taken in its literal sense of the name of the
Rite; and in that case we have to supply the term ‘*et cetera*.’

‘*Offered into the mouth*.’—The hand of the Brāhmaṇa is his ‘mouth’;
according to the declaration—‘The Brāhmaṇa has been described as having
his hands for his mouth.’

‘*Superior*’—more excellent.

This is purely commendatory; and should not be taken as actually
detracting from the value of the Fire-offerings.—(84)
