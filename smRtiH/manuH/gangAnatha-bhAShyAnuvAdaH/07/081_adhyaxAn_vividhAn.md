‘*Inspectors*’—duly authorised supervisors —‘*he shall appoint*.’

‘*Several*’—of various kinds; *i.e*. kind-hearted, hard-hearted,
righteous and experts in collecting wealth.

‘*Here and there*’,—in the treasury containing gold, in the collecting
of customs and taxes in cash and kind, in looking after the navy, the
elephants, the chariots, the horses and the foot-soldiers. To all this
he shall appoing (appoint?) ‘*proficient* men. All these should be
endowed with all the qualities of ministers; as has been declared in the
*Adhyakṣapracāra*—‘Those inspectors shall supervise all the works of men
who transact the king’s business as his agents,—*e.g*., elephant-keepers
in the keeping of elephants, masters of the horse in looking after
horses, and keepers of cattle in looking after ploughing and such
works’.—(81)
