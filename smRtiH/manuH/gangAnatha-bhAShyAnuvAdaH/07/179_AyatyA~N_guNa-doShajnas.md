Thus if a king knows the good and bad points of an act, likely to appear
in the future, he would act with deliberation; and would undertake only
such acts as are likely to develop good points, and avoid those likely
to lead to evil. It is for this reason that the knowledge of the likely
developments of an undertaking is necessary.

‘*Relating to the present*’;—he who takes quick decisions, and does not
delay their execution, is said to be ‘*quick in his decisions*’; such a
person is quick to act, and does what leads to good, and not what leads
to evil:

‘*In the past*’;—when an act has been done, if the man judges the act by
ite end only, he becomes great by reason of his undertaking only such
acts as lead to good;—and he is ‘*never overpowered by his enemies*’.

As a matter of fact, it is not possible for the Six measures of Policy
to be dealt with in detail in a work dealing with *Dharma*; hence the
subject has been treated of only briefly.—(179)
