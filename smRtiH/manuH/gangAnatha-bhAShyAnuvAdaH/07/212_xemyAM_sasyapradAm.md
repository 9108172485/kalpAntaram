Even though the land be as described he shall quit it without delay.

‘*Safe*’ — free from molestation at the hands of robbers and others.

‘*Fertile*’—productive of rich harvests, not dependent entirely upon
rain.

‘*Conducive to the increase of cattle*’,—being in a wild state, and
hence abounding in much fruit, or leaves or grass, the land becomes
conducive to the increase of cattle; abounding in tradesmen and
cultivators, free from famine and pestilence, and capable of maintaining
large numbers of men (?)

This does not mean that he shall evacuate in a hurry the territory
occupied by him; he should give up only that territory with regard to
which he feels that if he continued to stay, the people of the land
would try to recover it from him. So that as soon as he finds that
evacuation would not mean any financial or strategical harm to himself
and his allies, he shall, give up the territory even though it possesses
all the qualities described above.—(212)
