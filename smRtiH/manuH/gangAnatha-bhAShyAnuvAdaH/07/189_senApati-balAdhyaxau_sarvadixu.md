The ‘*Commander-in-Chief*’, the controller of the entire force and its
supplies, and the ‘*General*’—each of these being one only, and not
many, it would be impossible to station them ‘*in all directions*’;
hence the two names should be taken as standing for the subordinates of
the two officers; and when their subordinates have been stationed and
put in charge of all directions, the two officers themselves become so
‘stationed.’

Thus having stationed them in battle-array, with distinct
army-corps—each consisting of elephants and horses—alloted to each of
them, and having placed a mountain or a ditch in his rear, kept in
charge of a separate officer,—he shall regard that direction as the
‘East’ or ‘front’ from where he apprehends danger. In this manner he
shall arrange his camp, prepared to march forward, in the manner ot
learned men moving forward.—(189)
