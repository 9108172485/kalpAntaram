‘*Bent upon seizinq the properly of others*’—those who. are in the habit
of taking what belongs to others.

‘*Knaves*’—addicted to wicked deeds.

Persons appointed ore likely to become such; even though before
appointment they may be quite honest and hence inclined to protect the
wealth of other persons. Hence the King should not leave them alone,
relying upon their former character; he should be ever watchful of their
conduct.

‘*He shall protect the people against them*,’—By ignoring them, it is
not only the King’s own interest that suffers; the people also become
reduced to poverty.—(123)
