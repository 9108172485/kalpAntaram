The order of verses 128 and 129 of Medhātithi is reversed in the other
commentaries and hence by Buhler and Burnell.

‘*The person engaged in business*’—the trader—‘*and* *the king*’—may
receive their reward;—in such way should the taxes be levied; and there
is no ground for fixing the amount of the tax; in fact where the profit
made has been large, the King should charge heavier taxes—even exceeding
the proportion fixed.—(129)
