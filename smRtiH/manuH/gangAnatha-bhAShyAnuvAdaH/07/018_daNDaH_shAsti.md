It is not the King that administers the law, relating to the Injunction
of what ought to be done and the Prohibition of what ought not to be
done; it is Punishment that does this administering.

‘*Punishment alone protects*’— the weak against the strong.

‘*While all*’—King’s officers—‘*are asleep*’— it is only through fear of
punishment that people desist from doing what they like.

There are two kinds of this Punishment,—(*a*) that inflicted by the King
and (*b*) that inflicted by the God of Death (in hell).—(18)
