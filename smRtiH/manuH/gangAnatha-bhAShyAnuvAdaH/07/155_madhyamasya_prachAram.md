Of the said ‘circle’ the following are the four principal components—(1)
the King bent upon conquest, (2) the Enemy, (3) the Intermediary and (4)
the Neutral. Of these the King, who has people on his side and who has
made up his mind to conquer a certain part of the world, is called ‘bent
upon conquest,’ by reason of his being endowed with courage and
strength.—the ‘Enemy’ is of three kinds—(*a*) born, (*b*) natural and
(*c*) acquired.—The ‘Intermediary’ is the king whose territory is
co-terminous with that of the king in question.—The ‘Neutral’ is one who
is capable of defeating each of the two—‘one who is bent upon conquest’
and his ‘enemy’—singly, but not con jointly; and also each of the
three—‘he who is bent upon conquest,’ the ‘enemy’ and the
‘intermediary’—singly, but not conjointly.—(I55)
