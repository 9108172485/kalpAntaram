All the customs relating to the property of Brāhmaṇas or temples, and to
the duties of the people that may have been prevalent in the kingdom
from before,—all those he shall confirm, ‘*make authoritative*’. By so
doing, they become attached to him;—and the ‘lending men’ that may he
there,—their importance being due to their being rich in their
belongings and in the size of their family and such other
qualifications,—along with these, the new king shall be honoured with
presents of weapons, money, grains, ornaments, conveyances, umbrella,
throne, crown and so forth.—(203)

The next verse explains why precious gifts are to be made to the people.
