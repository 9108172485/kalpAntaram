Now follows the system of realising duties.

At what price the merchandise has been bought—what price it will fetch
when sold—what time it will take in selling—what deterioration, if any,
it is likely to suffer—the consideration of all this constitutes the
‘*investigation of the details of buying and selling*’.

‘*Journey*’—whether it takes much or little time to obtain it.

‘*Fooding*’—Flour, Rice &c.

‘*Accessories*’—*e.g*. butter, pulse, vegetables; as also fuel and such
things.

‘*Measures of safety*’—*i.e*. when passing through forests whether or
not things were secure against molestation by kings and robbers.

Having duly investigated all these, the King shall realise duties from
the traders.

The right reading is ‘*vaṇigbhir dāpayet karān*’; because according to
the *sūtra* ‘*gatibuddhi* &c.’ (Panini), there is nothing to justify the
Accusative case in ‘*vaṇijaḥ*,’ Or, the root in ‘*dāpayet*’ may mean
‘fine’, and hence like the root ‘*daṇḍī*’, it may take two objects
(which would justify the said Accusative ending).—(127)
