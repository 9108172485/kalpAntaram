The ‘*last watch*’ stands for the ‘*Brāhma-muhūrta*’, the ‘time sacred
to Brahman’; that it is so is indicated by the terms ‘*having performed
his ablutions*’, and ‘*with collected mind*’.

‘*Having poured the libations into Fire*’;—the performance of this act
of Homa-offering is not to be done during the ‘*Brahma-muhūrta*’; ince
at that time *four muhūrtas* (3 hours, 12 minutes) of the night would be
still left, while the Homa-offering has been laid down as to be done
when the night has dawned. So what all this means is simply—‘having
accomplished all that is to be done at dawn’.

‘*Having honoured*’ worshipped—‘*the Brāhmaṇas*’—‘*he shall enter the
auspicious Hall of Audience*’—equipped with auspicious marks.—(145)
