The text now describes what is to be done by one who is going to
undertake an expedition.

When he wishes to undertake an expedition against the enemy’s kingdom,
then he should advance, in the following manner against his capital,
without hurry.

This verse serves as an introduction to what is going to be described,
and serves the purpose of making it more easily intelligible.—(181)
