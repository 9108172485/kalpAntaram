If punishment were not inflicted, then the ‘*stronger*’—*i.e*., those
possessed of greater strength, or more energetic, or wieding (wielding?)
weapons, or being larger in numbers—‘*would have roasted the weaker*,
*like fish, on the spit*’;—*i.e*., just as fish are roasted on spit for
food, so would the less powerful, be treated, by the more powerful, by
suffering pecuniarily as well as physically, and also by being deprived
of their wives and so forth.

For this reason the King should ‘*untiringly*’ punish those that deserve
punishment; and he should not entertain any such notions as—‘How can I
carry on an investigation into this matter,? I shall not punish any one
at all.’—(20)
