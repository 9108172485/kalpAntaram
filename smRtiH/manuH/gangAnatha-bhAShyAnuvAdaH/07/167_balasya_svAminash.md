When different positions are taken up by the Master and his Army,—the
Master, with a small force, remains in the fort, while the Commander,
with a larger force proceeds elsewhere. Or, some sort of ‘bifurcation’
is resorted to by way of favouring the different divisions, in the way
of allowing all the divisions opportunities for securing booties of gold
and other things.

*Objection*.—“The measure here described is *Bifurcation*; and of this
there cun be only one form—different positions being taken up by the
Master and his Forces. There is no reason why any other kind of division
should be mentioned; the only bifurcation that need be mentioned is that
consisting in different positions being taken up by the Master and his
Forces.”

The answer to this is that it is by implication that we get at the other
two kinds of ‘bifurcation’—(1) one being that which is done for one’s
own sake and (2) that done for the sake of others.—(167)
