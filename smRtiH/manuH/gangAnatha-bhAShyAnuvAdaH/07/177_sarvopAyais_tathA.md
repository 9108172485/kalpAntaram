The mention of ‘expedients’ in general implies that use may be made of
these either severally or collectively; and the epithet ‘all’ indicates
that he may resort to whatever expedient he can; even such, for
instance, us the formation of cliques and the like.

‘*Act in such a manner*’—try to manage his affairs in such a way.

‘*Politic*’—well versed in the science of government, naturally
possessed of keen intelligence, as also conversant with the art of
politics.

‘*Superior*’—in the three elements of strength;—so that his allies and
others may not be so, he shall act in all things,—in the undertakings of
his people—in such a way as to make himself greater than all of them.

In view of metrical exigencies the author has omitted to mention the
‘intermediary’. But he also is to be watched, and not ignored, because
friendly. There is no such thing as a ‘friend’, without some motive of
his own; in fact when a friend becomes great, he also, for some purpose
of his own, becomes an enemy; as says Vyāsa—‘No one is anybody’s friend,
nor is any body any body’s enemy; friends and enemies are to be regarded
as such only in accordance with the powers that they possess.’

By means of these expedients, the king shall deliberate upon his. whole
circle.—(177)
