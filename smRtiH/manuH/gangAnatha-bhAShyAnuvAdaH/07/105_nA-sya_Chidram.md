The same idea is farther reiterated.

The king shall so act that while he becomes apprised of the enemy’s weak
points, his own remain carefully guarded. When he finds out, through his
trusted spies, that any of his own people belongs to one of the
aforesaid four sets of the ‘angered’ and the rest, he should try to
conciliate them.

His departments he shall hide, like the tortoise, and he shall also
guard his weak points. The guarding of one’s own weak points against the
enemy’s approaches is highly important;—this is what is meant by the
present verse.—(105)
