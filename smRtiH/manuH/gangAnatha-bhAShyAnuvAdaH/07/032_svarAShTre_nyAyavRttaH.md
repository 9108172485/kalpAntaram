The name ‘*own kingdom*’ is based upon the fact of the territory having
been inherited from one’s forefathers; *e.g*., Kāśmīra would be ‘own
kingdom’ for the King of Kāśmira, Pāñcāla would be ‘own Kingdom’ tor the
King of Pāñcāla; and so forth Therein ‘he shall be of just behaviour’,
*i.e*., act with justice;—he who behaves with justice is said to be ‘of
just behaviour’; the compound being expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*.

‘*Nyāyavṛttiḥ*’ is another reading.

The foregoing clause having reiterated what has been already enjoined
before, the Author enjoins ‘rigorous chastisement’ towards enemies. The
sense is that he shall attack the enemy’s territories outright, not
waiting for any such favourable opportunity as the enemy being beset
with difficulties or attacked by other kings. By acting thus, the king
acquires a glamour of glory; and to one who has attained this glamour,
the enemies bow down.

Towards all *Brāhmaṇas*, he shall be ‘*tolerant*’; *i.e*., even when
they have committed an offence, punishment shall be meted out to them in
a merciful, and not a revengeful, spirit.

When a king is attacking another kingdom, he does not destroy the
inhabitants of that realm, if it is at all possible to save them.

Towards ‘*loved friends*’ he shall be ‘*straightforward*’— free from
duplicity. One who helps in the accomplishment of the king’s business,
and who regards his business as his own and who looks upon his
prosperity and adversity as his own, is his ‘loved friend’.—(32).
