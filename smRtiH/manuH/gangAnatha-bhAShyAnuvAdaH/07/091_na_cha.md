The man on the chariot should strike only him who also is on a chariot;
so that one standing on the ground shall not be struck.

‘*Eunuch*’— who is devoid of masculinity; or who is without manliness.

‘*He who is seated*’—unconcerned, elsewhere; or on his chariot, or on
the ground.

He shall not strike also one who says ‘I am yours’. No stress is meant
to be laid upon the exact words to be used. What is meant is that he
shall not strike the poor supplicant who addresses to him such words as
‘I am yours’, ‘I seek your shelter’, and so forth (91)
