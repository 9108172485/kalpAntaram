He shall honour with gifts those Brāhmaṇas who have learnt the Veda and
studied what is contained in it in their teacher’s house and are
desirous of proceeding to Householdership.

This act of giving also is abligatory on the King. Hence it is said that
—‘*for the king this is interminable*—*i.e*., obligatory, hence
interminable, life-long. If it were voluntary, its necessity would cease
as soon as its fruits had been attained. This is exactly what is going
to be described under 11.1.

Others however hold that what is enjoined under 11.1 is the giving of
gifts to persons seeking for it, while the present context refers to
persons not seeking for gifts; hence all that is meant is that they
shall be duly honoured with such presents as those of a pair of cloth
and the like, just in obedience to the injunction laying down such
honouring, it is in view of this that the text has said ‘he shall do
honour to the Brāhmaṇas.’

‘*Brahmic*’—entrusted to the Brāhmaṇas.—(82).
