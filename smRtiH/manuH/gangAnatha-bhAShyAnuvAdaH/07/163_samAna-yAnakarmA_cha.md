**(verses 7.162-163)**

\(1\) ‘*That in which the act of marching is undertaken in common*’,—in
which the agreement entered into is in the following form:—‘Let us march
at the goal conjointly, having equal shares in it, and I shall not be
passed over by you; whatever we gain shall belong to both of us’:—(2) Or
that ‘You march one way, I go the other’; where the action is not joint,
it is ‘*otherwise*’—(162-163)
