Because the King ‘contains within himself the splendour of all,’
therefore,—‘*in favour of his favourites*’— towards those ministers,
priests and others who are in favour,—whenever in course of business, a
‘*decree*’— an ordinance, in consonance with Law and Custom—is ordained
or issued by the King;—no one should transgress such a decree. Such a
decree of the King’s should not be disobeyed; such a decree for instance
us—‘To-day, the city should observe a holiday—there is a marriage in the
minister’s house,—all men should be present there,—no animals shall be
slaughtered to-day by the soldiers,—no birds are to be caught,—for so
many days dancing girls shall be entertained by all wealthy men.’

Similarly ‘*against those in disfavour*’,—such a decree as—‘no one shall
associate with this person,—no one should allow him to enter his house’.

When such decrees are issued by the King by the beat of drum etc. they
shall not be transgressed. But the King has no power to control the
ordinances pertaining to religions acts, such as. the *Agnihotra* and
the like, of the orders and castes. Such control would be repugnant to
other *Smṛti* texts; and the present text has its application, without
offending against any *Smṛti* text, in cases indicated above.—(13).
