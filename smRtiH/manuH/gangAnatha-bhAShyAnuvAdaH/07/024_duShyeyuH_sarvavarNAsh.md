infliction in an unlawful manner. If there were any such, then ‘*all the

disappear; *Brāhmaṇas* would behave like *Śūdras* and *Śūdras* like
*Brāhmaṇas*. In this manner ‘*there would be disruption among all
regions*;—*i.e*., the three regions would not help each other by
imparting rain, heat and the rest.—(24)
