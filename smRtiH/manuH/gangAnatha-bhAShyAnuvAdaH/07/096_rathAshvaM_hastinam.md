‘*Baser metals*’—utensils of copper etc. as also beds and chairs etc.

‘*Belong to him who wins them*.’— The king being the master of all, he
might take away all the spoils of war; hence the text mentions a few
exceptions.

Gold, silver, lands, buildings and so forth accrue to the King; hence
the necessity of enumerating those that do not go to him. Arms and
conveyances also accrue to the King.

‘*Grains*’ and other things being mentioned separately, the term
‘wealth’ stands for cows, buffalos etc.

It is is view of all this that there is the popular saying—Half belongs
to the King’.—(96)
