This sums up the section.

‘*Warriors*’—soldiers; the ‘*law*’ of these men ;—‘*blameless*’—never
criticised or altered; hence ‘*eternal*’;—the law made by man would be
liable to be altered.

‘*Shall not deviate*’—fall off;—he shall always follow. The ‘*Kṣatriya*’
has been specially mentioned with a view to show that fighting is a duty
that devolves primarily upon him; and not to any one who may happen to
take his place.—(98)
