‘*Very much open to attack*’;—when he finds that while in the fortress,
he is very liable to be assailed,—then quickly he shall give up the
fortress and take refuge with another ‘*righteous king*’, at whose hands
he does not fear ill-treatment, who is famed for his calm and
dispassionate nature.

What is meant by the epithet ‘*powerful*’ is shown in the next
verse.—(174)
