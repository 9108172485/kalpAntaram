*Objection*—“Inasmuch as it has been laid down that *Śrāddhas* shall be
performed in the afternoon, where was there any possibility of
performance *at night* (that it should have been considered necessary to
prohibit it)? It might be argued that the specification of the time
itself implies the possibility of performance at other times also. This
may be true; but the specification contained in the words, ‘the
afternoon is preferable to the forenoon,’ (278) clearly indicates that
the performance is possible only at that time, in comparison with which
the prescribed time has been declared to be ‘preferable;’ so that the
only other time at which the *Śrāddha* might be performed is the
*forenoon* (and never the *night*).”

In answer to this, some people offer the following explanation:—The
present text serves to prohibit the performance at night, which might be
possible under the direction that Śrāddhas shall be performed during
lunar and solar eclipses. So that there being *prohibition* regarding
the twilights and the night, and *sanction* regarding lunar and solar
eclipses, there is option between the. two twilights and the two
eclipses, as also between the lunar eclipse and night.

Others, however, have explained that ‘midday’ is a time different from
both ‘afternoon’ and ‘forenoon;’ and the present prohibition implies
that there should be no performance at that time also.

‘*When the sun has just risen*,’—the time being the forenoon, the
prohibition applies to the first rising of the sun.

‘*Fit for demons*’—this is a purely reiterative exaggeration.—(280).
