This is a brief re-capitulation of what is going to be described in
detail.

‘*Beneficial and not-beneficial*’—Some marriages are beneficial, while
others are not so.

‘*Eight*’—this mentions the number.

‘*Marriage of girls*’—*i.e*., marriage which serves as the sacramental
rite for girls.

“What is it that is called *Marriage*?”

It is the name given to a sacramental rite performed for the girl,
obtained by certain means, which serves to make her a wife.

A girl having been obtained by certain means, one performs for her, for
the purpose of making her a *wife*, a sacramental rite, which ends with
the seeing of the constellation of Ursa Major, and is marked by the
holding of hands; and it is this rite, along with its entire procedure
and subsidiary details, that is called ‘Marriage.’—(20).
