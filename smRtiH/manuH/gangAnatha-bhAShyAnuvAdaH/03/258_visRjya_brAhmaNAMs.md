The preceding verse was only by the way; the present verse takes up the
thread of the context.

‘*Dismissed*’—having permitted them to go wherever they please.

‘*Those Brāhmaṇas*’—who have dined.

After this, looking towards the southern direction, he should
‘*beg*’—ask for—the following ‘*boom*’—desirable things —‘*of his
ancestors*;’ thinking all the time of his ancestors. He should beg—with
such words as—‘may this and this be mine after you have been
satisfied.’—(258)

The next verse describes what the boons are that should he begged.
