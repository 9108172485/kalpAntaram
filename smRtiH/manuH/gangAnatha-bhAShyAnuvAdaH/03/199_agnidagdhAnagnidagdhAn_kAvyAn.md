The present verse supplies a recommendation in support of the injunction
that the invited person should remain self-controlled.

Because ‘*the Pitṛs*,’—in their invisible forms —‘*attend upon*’—enter
into the body of—‘*the invited Brāhmaṇas*;’ just in the same manner in
which people are obsessed by evil spirits.

‘*Like the wind they follow him*;’—when a man moves along, the
‘*wind*’—in the form of his breath—follows him; and it does not leave
him while he is moving; and the Pitṛs also are in the form of air.

‘*So when they* ’—*the Brāhmaṇas*—‘*are seated*,’ “*they sit down*;’
*i.e*., they move when the Brāhmaṇas move and sit down when they are
seated. The meaning is that the invited Brāhmaṇas take the form of the
Pitṛs; hence those invited shall not be unrestrained in their
behaviour.—(189)
