In connection with the present subject, the author points out the
impropriety of receiving gifts from one who officiates at sacrifices
performed by *Śūdras*.

‘*Though learned in the Veda*;’—if he accepts the gift of something
belonging to one who officiates at sacrifices performed by *Śūdras*,

‘*Through covetousness*’—is a mere reiterative reference.

He also *perishes quickly*—*i.e*., he is deprived of what he desires,—in
the shape of wealth, children, cattle, body, and the like.

When such is the fate of one learned in the Veda—what is to be said of
one who is ignorant of the Veda?

The author will point out later on that there is not much harm in the
learned man’s receiving gifts.

‘*Āma*’—unbaked—‘*pātra*’—vessels, such as saucer, and the like.

‘*In water*’—*i.e*., when thrown into water.—(179)
