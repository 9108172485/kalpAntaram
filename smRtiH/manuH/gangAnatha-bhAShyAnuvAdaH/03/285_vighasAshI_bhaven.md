‘*Whatever*.’—This term sanctions the offering of everything, not
actually prohibited.

‘*According to rule*’ is a reiteration of what has been said by means of
the term, ‘*in the right manner*.’

‘*Endowed with faith*’— This is what is actually prescribed in the
present verse:—‘one should make the offering with due faith.’

What is given in this manner ‘*becomes endless and inexhaustible for the
Pitṛs in the other world*.’ ‘Endless’ may be taken as denying all
limitation of time;—‘*Inexhaustible*’ denies non-diminishing of
quantity; the sense being ‘it lasts for all time and becomes large in
quantity.’—(275)
