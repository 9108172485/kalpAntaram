‘*The Brāhmaṇa*’—who may arrive as a guest.

‘*The mendicant*’—the Brāhmaṇa that may come begging for alms.

‘*On being permitted* *by* *the Brāhmaṇas*,’ busy with eating,

‘*he shall entertain*,’ according to his ability, *i.e*., he shall
honour them by offering food, or by giving alms in the proper manner.
\[The permission of the invited Brāhmaṇas is essential, because\] on
that day, the food has been cooked specially for them.—(243)
