‘*Servant*’—one who carries out orders: one who is sent by the
village-people hither and thither, on business.

Similarly, ‘*the servant of the king*,’ ‘*one who hew deformed nail*,’
‘*one who has black teeth*.’

‘*Opposer of his teacher*’— he who, in conversation and other things,
remains against and in opposition to his superior.

‘*One who has forsaken the Fire*’—*i.e*., out of the Three Fires and the
Domestic Fire, one who has given up even one,

‘*Usurer*’—one who, even though he has other menus of living available,
lives upon interest. Though ‘Usury’ has been defined as ‘the
accumulating *of grains* by interest,’ yet this definition can be
accepted as authoritative only within the limited scope of the subject
dealt with by the Smṛti in which it occurs; in fact, grammarians apply
the term ‘usurer’ to persons making a living by interest, in connection
with things other than grains also: and, in the matter of words and
their meanings, grammarians are more authoritative than others; because
they make these the subject of careful study.—(153)
