The Havirbhujs are here spoken of as ‘Haviṣmats.’

‘*Kavi*’ is Bhrgu. They say that ‘Uśanas is called *Kāvya*, as also
*Bhārgava*.’

‘Just as these gods are the sons of sages, so your Pitṛs also are
god-like in their nature; hence you should not disregard them,’—\[such
is the purport of these verses\].—(198)
