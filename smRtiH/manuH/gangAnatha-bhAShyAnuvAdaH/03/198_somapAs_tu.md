One invited ‘*at a rite in honour of Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., a t a
*śrāddha—‘shall remain self controlled*;’ *i.e*., with his mind under
control, he shall maintain continence and keep up also the other
restraints and observances—such as the observances of the ‘*Snātaka*,’
and so forth. The avoidance of dancing, music, etc., which are the
observances to be kept up by men, has been prescribed as part and parcel
of religions rites; hence the performer of the *śrāddha* shall so
arrange things that the invited Brāhamaṇa, from the moment he has been
invited, shall keep control over his sense-organs; otherwise the
*śrāddha* would become defective.

‘*He shall not recite the Veda*;’—what is prohibited is the *reciting*
of the texts of the Veda; the mere repeating of *mantras* during the
evening and morning prayers is not prohibited.

‘*Also the man who performs the Śrāddha*’—*i.e*., at the rite that one
performs in honour of the Pitṛs, one should, like the invitee, remain
self-controlled; the construction is—‘So the man also...... shall remain
self-controlled.’ The meaning is, that the rule regarding self-control
and avoiding of Veda-reciting applies alike to the inviter and the
invitee, from the moment of invitation onwards.—(188)
