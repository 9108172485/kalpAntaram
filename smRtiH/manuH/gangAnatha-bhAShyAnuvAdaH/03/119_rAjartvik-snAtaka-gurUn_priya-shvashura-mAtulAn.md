This verse contains an advice offered, by the way, to the guest.

Seeking for food, he shall not say—‘I belong to such and such a family,
I am the son of so and son; in this fashion he shall not advertise his
‘family or *gotra*.’ The ‘*family*’ consists of his father, grandfather,
and so forth;—‘*gotra*’—may stand either for such Ṛṣi-names as
‘*Garga*,’ ‘*Bhārgava*,’ etc.; or for one’s *name*. That the term
‘*gotra*’ means *name* also is shown by such usage as ‘mistake in
names,’ ‘*gotraskhalita*’ which term is used in the event of a man
pronouncing a name other than the one he intended to pronounce.

His ‘learning’ also he should not advertise; as this also has been
prohibited in another *Smṛti*.

The Text adds a declamatory, assertion:—‘*For the purpose of obtaining a
meal*’—*i.e*., with the motive that by advertising my family and *gotra*
I shall succeed in obtaining a meal, if one brags about these—*family
and gotra*,—he is called by the wise ‘*Vāntāśin*,’ ‘*feeder-on
filth*,’—he who swallows what has been vomitted.—(109)
