‘*Ketitaḥ*’ means *invited*.

‘*Havye kavye*’—at the rite in honour of Gods, and at the rite in honour
of the Pitṛs. Having accepted the invitation and promised to eat,—if
‘*somehow he neglects it*,’—*i.e*., does not present himself at the time
of eating, or, if he does not maintain continence,—then such a Brāhmaṇa
‘*becomes a hog*.’

‘*Somehow*’—*i.e*., either intentionally, or through lapse of memory.

‘*Duly*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling up the verse.

Others have held that the ‘*neglect*’ here stands for *non-acceptance of
the invitation*; according to what has been said in the
*Śrāddhakalpa*—‘one should not fail to accept the invitation of a man
free from all blame.’

This, however, is not right; it is through desire to eat that men become
prone to go to *śrāddhas*; and if a man happens to have no such desire,
and hence refuses the invitation, what sin could there be in
this?—(190.)
