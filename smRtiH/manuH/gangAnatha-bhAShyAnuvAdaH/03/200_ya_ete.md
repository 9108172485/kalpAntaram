The ‘*Somapā*,’ and the rest, are the ‘*principal bodies of Pitṛs*.’ Of
these there are endless sons and grandsons; and these latter also are
Pitṛs.

The mention;of this indefinite number indicates that the offerings are
not to be made in reference to the *Somapa* andothers; for, if the sons
and grandsons of these were ‘Pitṛs’ then, as Pitṛs, these sons and
grandsons also may have the offerings made in reference to them; and yet
no names of these have been mentioned; whence it is clear that all this
is merely laudatory description.

The singular number in ‘*putrapautrakam*’ is in accordance with Pāṇini
2.4.10.

‘*Endless*’—unlimited; the ‘*ka*’ having the reflexive sense.—(200)
