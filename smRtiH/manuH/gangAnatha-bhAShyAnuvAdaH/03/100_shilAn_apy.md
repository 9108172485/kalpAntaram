The particle ‘*eha*’ indicates that there is only one oblation.

‘*To the Viśvedevas*’ the offering is to be thrown up into the
sky—either within the house, or outside the house.

During the day, the offering should be made to the ‘elementals roaming
in the day,’ and during the night it should be made to those ‘roaming at
night;’—‘elementals’ being construed both ways.

Some people explain that these two offerings pertain respectively to the
morning and evening.

But this is not right, as the evening-oblation is to be offered without
any words, as is going to be mentioned below (verse 121).

“But what is mentioned there may mean simply that the articulate
dedication of the offering is forbidden; but what is there to prevent
the mental (silent) dedication? In fact, without some such dedication
the offering would not be an ‘offering’ at all.”

But what you have got to explain is—from where you have learnt this
distinction. If it is one that has been made by authors of the
(*Gṛhyasūtras* themselves;—then it may be as you say.—(90)
