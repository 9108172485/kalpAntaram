‘*Fortner* *halt of the month*’ is the brighter fortnight; and ‘*latter
half*’ is the darker fortnight;—months being counted from the brighter
fortnight of *Caitra* onwards.

Just as, for purposes of Śrāddha, the darker fortnight is preferable
to—is productive of better results than -the brighter fortnight, so is
the afternoon preferable to the forenoon. From the declaration of this
‘preference,’ it follows that in some cases one might perform a
*śrāddha* during the forenoon also.

“As a rule, the illustration should be well known; as a matter of fact,
however, nowhere has the text declared the superiority of the darker
fortnight to the brighter fortnight, for purposes of *Śrāddha*. \[Hence
the illustration is not apt\].”

Some people explain that the said superiority is understood from what
has been said under 276, regarding the ‘darker fortnight’ and ‘days
beginning with the tenth.’ Our explanation, however, is as
follows:—According to the principle laid down in *Mīmāṃsāsūtra* 3. 5.
21, even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration; so that, in the
case in question, from the citation of the illustration itself we may
even deduce the necessary injunction (regarding the performance of
*Sharddhas* ( *Śrāddhas*?) during the darker fortnight).—(278)
