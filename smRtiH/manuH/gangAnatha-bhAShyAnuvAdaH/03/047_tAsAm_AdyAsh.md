‘*Of these*’—days—‘*the first four*’— beginning from the day on which
the blood is first seen—‘*have* *been deprecated*,’—*i.e*., there should
be no intercourse on those days. On the first three days, even touching
is prohibited, the woman being impure on those days; on the fourth day,
when she has bathed,—though, according to the words of Vaśiṣṭha, she is
pure—there is to be no sexual intercourse; all the four days being
equally deprecated (for that purpose).

‘*The eleventh and the thirteenth*’ days also ‘have been
deprecated,’—*i.e*., on those days also intercourse has been forbidden.
The ‘eleventh’ and the ‘thirteenth’ days are those counted from the
first day of the flow; they do not stand for the two dates of the month;
because the genitive ending in ‘*tāsām*,’ ‘of these,’ signifies
*selection*; and, as the pronoun stands for ‘days,’ it must be the same
thing (day) that is *selected*; just as in the expression, ‘of cows, the
black one gives most milk.’

This prohibition of intercourse on the said six days is with a view to a
transcendental result.

‘*The remaining ten days have been recommended*,’—(of the sixteen days)
six days having been forbidden, the commendation of the remaining ten
days follows naturally; and it is this same natural conclusion that is
reiterated here.—(47)
