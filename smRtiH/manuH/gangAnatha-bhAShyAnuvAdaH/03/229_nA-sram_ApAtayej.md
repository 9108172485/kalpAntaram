‘*Asra*’ is tear; this he should not ‘*shed*’—drop. As a rule, during
the performance of *Śrāddha* in honour of the dead, one is apt to recall
the grief caused by the loss of the loved person, which leads to the
shedding of tears; and this is what is prohibited here; there is no harm
in the sudden dropping of the tears of joy.

‘*Never*’—on no account—shall he shed tears.

‘*He should not become angry*,’—should not take up an angry attitude.

The telling of a lie having been already prohibited with a view to the
fulfilment of man’s purpose in general, it is again prohibited here,
with a view to the due fulfilment of the act of *śrāddha*.

‘*He should not touch the food with his foot*’—any food, either in the
form of leavings or otherwise.

‘*He should not shake* *it*’—*i.e*., he shall not throw it by hand and
then again take it in.

Others have explained this verse to mean that he shall not shake a piece
of cloth over the food, as is often done for the removing of dust, etc.,
from it.—(229)
