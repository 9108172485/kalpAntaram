‘*At* *it*’—at the *śrāddha*;—those Brāhmaṇas that should be fed,—as
also those that should be avoided;—‘*how* *many*’—what number; as is
going to be pointed out that ‘two should be fed at the offering to the
gods, and so forth’ (125);—‘*on what food*,’—‘on sesamum, barley, etc.’
(267) all this ‘*I am now going to describe*’— listen-to it.

This (feeding of Brāhmaṇas) is the chief thing to be accomplished; for
without this the *śrāddha* is as good as not done. As for the subsidiary
factors,—those that help in the performance directly, as well as those
that help indirectly,—even if these are not duly accomplished, the
*śrāddha* is done,—only it is not quite complete in its details. Hence
it is that the subjects have been propounded again, for the purpose of
indicating their predominant character.—(124.)
