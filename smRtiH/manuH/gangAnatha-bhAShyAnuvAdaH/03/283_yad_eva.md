The present verse sets forth an option to the daily *Śrāddha* that has
been prescribed in connection with the ‘Five Sacrifices.’

The ‘offering of water’ that is made after bath,—by that he obtains the
reward of the offering to the Pitṛs. That is, it is not absolutely
necessary to do what has been said (in 3.83) regarding the feeding of at
least one Brāhmaṇa and the rest of it. It is only the *Water-offering*
that must be made.—(283).
