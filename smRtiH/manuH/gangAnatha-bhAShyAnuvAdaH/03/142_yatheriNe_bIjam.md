One who is ‘*distinguished*’—who excels—‘*by knowledge*’—in learning; to
such a one ‘*should be given*’ ‘*the offerings for gods and Pitṛs*.’

The sense of the metaphor of the ‘*hand smeared with bloo*’ is as
follows:—‘Hands smeared with blood when washed with blood only become
all the more reddened, and they are not cleansed; similarly, the
ignorant *Brāhmaṇa*, when, fed, only carries the ancestors to still
worse hells,’—(132)
