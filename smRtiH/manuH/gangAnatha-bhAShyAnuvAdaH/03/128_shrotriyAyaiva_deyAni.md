‘*Learned in the Veda*’—he who recites the entire Vedic text, Mantras as
well as Brāhmaṇas: to him;—‘the food offered to the gods’—*i*.*e*.,
those articles of food that are offered, in connection with *Śrāddhas to
the* *Visve-devas*:—‘*should be given*;’—as also ‘*the food offered*
*to* *the Pitṛs*,’

‘*Most deserving*;’—‘desert (deserve?)’ here stands for *respectability*
and *ability*. It is a person born of a noble family that is respected;
and a person born of a noble family is generally equipped with learning
and character.

‘*What is given to him*,’—even things other than the *Śrāddha-*
offerings,—‘*is conducive to great results*.’ The meaning is that—‘gift
made to the unlearned is fruitless; that made to a person learned in the
Veda, but devoid of nobility and other good qualities, is conducive to
some slight results; and that to the most deserving is conducive to
great results.’—(128)
