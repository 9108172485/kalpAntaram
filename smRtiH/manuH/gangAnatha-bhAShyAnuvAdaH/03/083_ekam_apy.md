In certain Vedic texts, it is these sacrifices that have been enjoined
under these names; hence the present verse mentions these names, with a
view to show that the injunction of these is based upon the Veda itself.

What is meant also is that the rites that have been mentioned in the
Veda by the names. ‘*Ahuta*’ and the rest, are also included here,
though not mentioned by the same names. This is another purpose that the
author had in view in mentioning these other names; just like the names
‘*brahmayajña*,’ ‘*śrāddha*,’ ‘*udvāha*,’ ‘*parikriyā*,’ and so
forth.—(73)
