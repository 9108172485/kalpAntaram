The author is reminding his audience of what he had said before (Verse
22) regarding the ‘good and bad points of each form of marriage.’ Many
things have been promised as to be described; and what he means to do by
this verse is to point out that by means of the forthcoming verses he is
going to explain such and such a subject. The reiteration contained iu
this verse therefore is quite proper.

‘*Of these forms of marriage*’.— The genitive has- the sense of
*selection*. The meaning being that from among these marriage-forms, to
each has been ascribed a quality by the teacher, Munu;—‘*To all this
listen, O Brāhmaṇas*.’ This is addressed by Bhṛgu to the great sages.

‘*Correctly*’’—without altering anything.

‘*proceed to describe*’—expound.—(36)
