This verse is supplementary to the foregoing verse.

‘*Bride’s properties*’—*i.e*., those properties that are received from
the bridegroom for the sake of the bride; ‘*the relations*’—fathers and
others—‘*who, through folly, live upon*’ them;—as described above (in
verse 31)

‘The’ *property* here spoken, of is that in the form of gold and silver.

‘*Bride’s conveyances*’—such as the horse and the rest.

‘*Clothes*;’—even such paltry things as clothes and conveyances should
not be lived upon,—what to say of more valuable properties?

The text proceeds to describe what befalls those who do live upon such
properties,—they are ‘*sinners*—and by doing what is prohibited in the
scriptures—‘they *fall into the lowest state*’—*i.e*., into hell.

Or, ‘*bride’s properties*’ may be taken in the sense, in which it is
going to be described in Discourse 9 below. Those who, through folly,
live upon those properties;—the ‘*relations*,’ in this case, would stand
for the girl’s father and his kinsmen, as also the husband and his
relations. Similarly, with ‘conveyances’ and ‘clothes the ‘*clothes*’
also those belonging to the bride; this connection being assumed on the
basis of the proximity of the term ‘*bride*’ (in the compound term
‘bride’s conveyances’); just as in the case of the use of expression,
‘royal servant,’ if some one asks, ‘whose?,’—this is taken to mean ‘of
what *king*?’—(52)
