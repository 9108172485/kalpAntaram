The food should be *fetched* and *served* with both hands, not with one
hand, *serving* also being a kind of *fetching*; hence, the rule laid
down in connection with the latter is applicable to the former also. In
support of this, the present verse supplies a commendatory supplement.

That which is ‘*abandoned*’—not held—‘*by both hands*,’ such food, when
brought up for serving,—the ‘*demons destroy*’
‘*forcibly*,’—‘*wicked-minded*’—of malevolent nature;—‘*demons*’ *i.e*.,
the enemies of gods.

In ‘*ubhayoḥ*,’ ‘*both*,’ the Locative ending denotes location; and
‘*abandoned*’ means *not held*. As a matter of fact, case-endings are
used even when what is spoken of is the *negation* of what is denoted by
the ending; *e.g*., we have such expressions as ‘he does *not come from
the village*,’ ‘he does *not sit on the seat*,’ ‘he does *not fast for
three dags*.’ \[Similarly, in the text though *negation of holding* is
mentioned, yet we have the Locative ending denoting location\].—(225)
