‘*Sacred*’—*i.e*., conducive to sanctity, bringing about excellence.

The first half of this verse is purely reiterative, and the latter half
is injunctive.

‘*Cleanliness*’—avoidance of contact with unclean things; and if,
through want of care, the man happens to become unclean, he should
purify himself with clay, water, &c., in the manner prescribed in the
scriptures.

‘*Absence of haste*’—*i.e*., the feeding of Brāhmaṇas and doing the
other acts with confidence and in a steady manner.—(235)
