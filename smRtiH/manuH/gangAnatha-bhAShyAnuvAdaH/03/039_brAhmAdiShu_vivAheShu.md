In verse 22, it has been asserted that the author was going to describe
‘the good and bad points of offsprings;’ this is what is being done now.

‘*Anupūrvaśaḥ*’ (successively) is an expression that authors of *Smṛtis*
use in the sense of ‘*ānupurvyeṇa*.’

The honour and fame that one receives by virtue of his learning,
knowledge and superior wisdom, are called ‘Brahmic glory;’ those
possessed of this are called ‘endowed with Brahmic glory,’ The term ends
in the Possessive affix ‘*in*.’

‘*Respected by cultured persons*’—favoured, not hated, not ill-treated;
*i.e*, liked. Inasmuch as the root in ‘*sammata*’ does not signify
*thinking*, it does not fall under Pāṇini’s Sūtṛa.3. 2. 188; and hence
the compounding does not become precluded by Pāṇiṇi 2. 2. 12; and the
genitive ending in ‘*śiṣṭa*’ denotes mere relationship in general.—(39)
