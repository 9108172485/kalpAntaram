When several guests of several grades—superior, inferior and
equal—arrive at the same time, then the seat, &c., that are offered to
them should not all be of the same quality; they should be in accordance
with their relative merits.

‘*Seat*’— the mat, and so forth.

‘*Room*’—place for resting.

‘*Bed*’—bedstead, &c.

‘*Following*’— going after him when he goes.

‘*Attendance*’— keeping near him and entertaining him with conversation.

All this should be ‘*of the best kind, to superiors*.’ &e.,—*i.e*., the
superior guest should be followed to a great distance; the medium guest,
not very far: and the inferior, only a few steps.—(107)
