The preceding verse has described the person to whom presents are to be
made; the present verse proceeds to prohibit the giving of presents to
unqualified persons.

‘*Become lost*’—become fruitless.

‘*Rites in honour of the gods*’—Such acts as the feeding of Brāhmaṇas
and the like, which are done in honour of the gods.

‘*Rites in honour of the Pitṛs*’—those that form part of the acts done
in honour of one’s ancestors; *i.e*., *Śrāddhas*.

‘*Ash-like*—those who hav *become ashes* are called ‘*bhasmabhūta*. Or,
the term ‘*bhūta*’ may mean *similarity*; hence the word ‘*bhasmabhūta*’
means ‘*ash-like*;’ just as in the compound ‘*kāṣṭhabhūta*.’

“What is the point of similarity between *ash* and the *Brāhmaṇas?*”

The meaning is that, just as the ash is of no use, and is mere refuse
and deserves only to be thrown away, so the Brāhmaṇa in question is to
be removed from all religious functions.

‘*Made by ignorant men*’— this is to be construed with ‘*become lost*.’

‘*Presented by givers through folly*’—‘ignorant’ and ‘folly’ are only
re-iterations. Anything that is prohibited in the scriptures is done
only through folly.

The next verse describes what sort of Brāhmaṇas are not ‘ash-like.’—(97)
