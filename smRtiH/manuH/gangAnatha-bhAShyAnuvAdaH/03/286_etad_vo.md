Though much has intervened between this and the description of the ‘Five
Sacrifices,’ yet the present reference to the latter, in the final
summing up, is with a view to auspiciousness.

The second half of the verse indicates a part of the subject-matter of
the next Discourse.

The usefulness of both these—the Summing Up and the Indicating of what
is coming next—has already been explained.

‘*The best of twice-born persons*’—*i.e*., Brāhmaṇas. the ‘*means of
livelihood*’—professions by which they should live.—Or, the construction
may be ‘the principal means of livelihood of twice-born persons.’ All
this shall be explained in the next chapter.—(286)
