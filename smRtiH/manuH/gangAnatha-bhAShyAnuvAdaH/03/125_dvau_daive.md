title = "125 द्वौ दैवे"

‘*Before giving food to these*’—*i.e*., to those just mentioned,
beginning with the guest and ending with the servant—‘*the foolish
man*’— who does not know the law—‘*eats*’— is devoured, after death, by
dogs and vultures.

This ‘*being devoured*’—being eaten—by them, he does not understand. The
foolish man simply feels that ‘I am eating now,’ and he does not
understand that his eating in this manner means the eating of his own
body by dogs and vultures. This latter is the result of such eating;
hence it has been thus described.—(115)
