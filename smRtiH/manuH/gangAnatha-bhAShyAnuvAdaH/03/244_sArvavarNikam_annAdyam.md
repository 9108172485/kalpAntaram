The propriety of feeding the daughter’s son is put forward here as a
substitute (for what has been enjoined in the preceding verses).

The ‘*Kutapa*’ is a piece of cloth of the shape of a blanket, and made
of the goat-wool; it is known among the Northerners as ‘*Kambala*’
(Blanket). This he should give as sent.

This does not apply to the case of the daughter’s son only, but to that
of all guests; that this is so, is shown by what is going to be said
regarding ‘three things being sacred at śrāddhas’ (next verse); which
shows that this is meant to apply to every kind of *śrāddha*.

‘*Scatter sesamum*’—on the ground.—(234)
