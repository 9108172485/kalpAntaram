The author now proceeds to show the purpose why he has provided a
classification of the qualities.

Offerings made to the Pitṛs are called ‘*Kavya*;’ these should be
‘*presented*’—given—‘*to those excelling in learning*.’

‘*Carefully*’—implies that if one does not take special care, these
also, like the offering to gods, should be given to all the four.

For the offerings to Pitṛs the best recipients are those excelling in
learning,—it having been declared that ‘he is the recipient among
recipients.’

What the verse means is that food in general should be given to all the
four, without any distinction.

‘*Law*’— Rule laid down in the scriptures.—(135)
