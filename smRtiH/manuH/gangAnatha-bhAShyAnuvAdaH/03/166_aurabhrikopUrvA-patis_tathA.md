‘*Urabhra*’ is *sheep*; one who ‘deals’ in these,—*i.e*., carries on the
business of buying and selling them; it may also mean ‘one whose chief
wealth consists in sheep.’

Similarly, the ‘*buffalo-keeper*.’

‘He who has had another man for her former husband;’—the husband of such
a one; *i.e*., one who marries again the woman who has been previously
given to—or married by—another man; he who ‘again’ (*punaḥ*) ‘*becomes*’
(*bhavati*) the husband; such a husband is called ‘*paunarbhava*’ by the
scriptures.

He who carries the dead—*i.e*., carries the dead bodies.

These ‘*should be avoided with care*’— (166).
