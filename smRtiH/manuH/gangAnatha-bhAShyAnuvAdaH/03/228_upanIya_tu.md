Water should be poured again near the balls, out of the same vessel from
which it had been poured upon the kuśa-blades, before the offering or
the balls.

‘*Remaining*’;—this is meant to show that, the net mentioned is to be
regarded as the ‘disposal of remnants;’ it is only in this sense that
the term ‘*remaining*’ becomes justifiable. From this it follows that,
in the event of there being no ‘remnant,’ there shall be no ‘pouring.’
But in the *Gṛhyasūtra*, it has been declared that this ‘pouring of
water’ is obligatory.

‘*He should smell these balls*;’—‘*smelling*,’ consists of *eeling the
odour*; but in the *Gṛhyasūtra* it is said that ‘he should *eat* it with
his breath.’

‘*in the order in which they were offered*,’—the order in which they
were offered being, *first* to the father, *second* to the grandfather,
and *third* to the great-grandfather;—‘*with collected mind*’—this is
for filling up the metre.—(218.)
