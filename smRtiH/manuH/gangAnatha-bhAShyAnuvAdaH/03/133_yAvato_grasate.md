Even though it is the *śrāddha* that forms the subject-matter of the
present context, yet the present verse describes the evil results
occurring to the eater; it is to this effect that it has been declared
that ‘for this reason should the ignorant person fear the acceptance of
gifts from this and that person.’

‘*Spikes and spears*’ are the names of particular weapons. Such a person
is made by the attendants of the Lord of Death to eat red-hot
iron-balls.

According to Vyāsa’s view, the evil result accrues to the person
offering the focal, and not to the eater, nor to the ancestors. Because
it cannot be right to connect the dead ancestors with the evil arising
from the disobeying, by another person, of the prohibition (of the
feeding ignorant persons); as in that case, there would be the absurdity
of a man suffering what he has not earned. If an ignorant person has
been fed by the *son*, what fault is there of his dead ancestors?

“But by this same reasoning the benefit also of the *śrāddha* should not
accrue to the ancestors.”

It would certainly not accrue to them, if the śrāddha-offering had not
been distinctly enjoined as being for their benefit. In the present case
(of feeding Brāhmaṇas), however, there is no such injunction as that
‘this should be done by one who desires to confer a benefit on one’s
son,’ as there is in the case of the *Śyena* sacrifice. Then, as regards
the words of the present text, they can fit in also with the person
ottering the food; the construction in this case being—‘that man, at
whose performance of the *śrāddha* such a person eats, obtains such and
such a result.’ What forms the subject-matter of the present context is
the prohibition of the feeding of ignorant persons; and the disregarding
of this prohibition would render the rite defective; and this defect in
the Kite would lead to the evil result that the man would no longer be
entitled to the performance of that rite \[aud this would pertain to the
*giver*, not *eater*, of the food\]; and since the ancestors derive
benefit from the *śrāddha*, for this reason also the transgressing of
its injunction should involve guilt on the part of the son.

“What are the precise words of Vyāsa (on this subject)?”

\[They are\]—‘As many mouthfuls as an ignorant person swallows out of a
man’s offerings, so many spikes does he swallow on going to the abode of
Death.’

In place of ‘*preto*’ some people read ‘*pretya*;’ where also the term
‘having died’ pertains to the *eater*; and the sense of the text is that
‘the ignorant mail shall not eat of the offerings made to gods and
ancestors.’—(133)
