‘Rites performed for the gods’ are not regarded as conferring any
benefit on the gods; such, however, is not the case with this rite which
is named ‘*Pitrya*.’ “What then?” It is ‘*known*,’ among people learned
in the Vedas as ‘*beneficial to the dead*’—as conferring a benefit on
the dead.

‘*On the moonless night*’—on the day on which there is no moon; *i.e*.,
the *amārasyā* day. Another residing is ‘*vidhikṣaye*.’ But the most
faultless reading is ‘*vidhuhṣaye*.’ The meaning of the former would be
that the rile named *Pitryā* is one that has been prescribed as to be
done in the house.

‘*Upon this*’—upon this rite,—‘*he who is intent*’—he who is busy with
its performance. To him there ‘*always accrues*,’ ‘*benefit after
death*;’ *i.e*., for him also benefit after death is conferred by his
sons performing the *śrāddha* and other rites for him.

What this means is that the continuity of the lines of one’s
descendants—sons and grandsons—is the reward of performing *śrāddhas*.
But this reward is not the incentive to its performance; as the rite has
already been described as an obligatory one.

Others, however, have regarded this as indicating another incentive, for
one desiring continuity of his line.

‘*Offered according to human ordinances*’:—*i.e*., this rite is
performed according to rules laid down in the *Smṛtis*.—(127)
