There being a distinction of castes, ‘one’s own caste’ constitutes the
(upward) limit. Just as for the Brāhmaṇa, there are Kṣatriya and other
wives, so it would seem as if for the Śūdra also there would be wives
belonging to the lower orders of ‘washer-woman and carpenter.’ In order
to preclude this possibility, the text lays down the restriction that
the *Śūdra* can have a wife from his own caste only. A wife of the
higher caste is precluded by the qualifying phrase, ‘in due order,’ in
the preceding verse.

‘*She*’—*i.e*., the Śūdra woman—‘*and girl of his own caste*’—*i.e*.,
the Vaiśya woman—‘for the Vaiśya.’

‘*Those two*’—the Vaiśya woman and the Śūdra woman,—‘*and* *the girl of
his own caste*’— ‘*for the Kṣatriya*.’

Similarly, ‘*for the Brāhmaṇa*.’

The right order would appear to be that the verse should begin with the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ but it begins with the ‘*Śūdra*’ which only goes to lend
strength to the aforesaid notion (that a wife of the higher class is not
permitted).

In this connection, it has been declared that ‘what is meant by the text
is that there should be *option* in order, and not a combination of all
(the several kinds of wives).’—(13)
