‘*Duly*’—*i.e*., with the mind bent upon the deity, and not wandering
over anything else.

Having offered in the Fire the oblation to these deities—he should place
‘*in all directions*, *proceeding*,’ in due order, ‘*towards his
right*;’ at first in the East, then in the South, and so forth, this
being the ‘movement towards one’s right;’

‘*To* *Indra, Antaka, Ap-pati and Indu*’—in each direction.

Another writer remarks that ‘Indu’ has no share in the oblation (the
offering being made to *Soma*). If this name is not to be used in making
the offering, how could ‘Indu’ be spoken of (as he is in this verse) as
a partaker of the oblation? And it has been explained that the ‘placing
of the *bali*’ is nothing other than *Homa*.

As a matter of fact, no stress is meant to be laid upon the special form
of the names used; as they have been used only in view of the exigencies
of metre; so that, in actual usage, the names to be used should be those
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*.

‘*Along with their followers*’—‘followers’ stands for servants,
attendants; the formula used in such cases being ‘*Indrapuruṣebhyaḥ
svāhā*,’ and so forth.—(87)
