The *Śrāddha* should be performed in the afternoon.

‘*These are the essentials* *of* *Śrāddha rites*,’—*i.e*., attempt
should be made to bring about all these things.

Though the present text mentions the ‘afternoon’ without reference to
any particular *Śrāddha*, yet it is not to be observed in connection
with *all* Śrāddhas: for we have another Smṛti-text to the effect
that—‘rites in honour of the gods shall he performed in the forenoon;
that in honour of the Pitṛs in the afternoon; the Śrāddha offered to a
single person shall be performed at mid-day, while that in connection
with auspicious rites shall be performed in the morning.’

‘*Dwelling*’—house; the ‘*setting* *up*’ ‘of this consists in the
white-washing of the walls with lime etc., the smearing of the floor
with cowdung; having its slope to wards the south.

‘*Liberality*’—charity; *i.e*., unstinted giving away of food and
vegetables.

‘*Cleaning*’—washing; *i.e*., a particular maimer of preparing the food.

Others have explained this verse to mean that these things constitute
the ‘excellence’—the superiority—of the rites,—and not that they shall
not be performed without these.—(255)
