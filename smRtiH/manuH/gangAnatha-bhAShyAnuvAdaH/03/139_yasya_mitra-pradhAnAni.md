This verse supplies the commendatory supplement to the foregoing
prohibition.

The term ‘*friend*’ is used here in the abstract sense; hence the
meaning is ‘in which friendship enters as the prime consideration.’ And
this includes both friend and foe.

The term ‘*sacrifice’ stands* for (1) gifts given with reference to gods
and (2) the feeding of Brāhmaṇas with a view to some transcendental
result.

‘*Pretya phalam nāsti*’ (‘after death there is no reward’)—

“No construction is possible of this clause; since the nominative of the
root ‘*pra + iṇ*’ (of the act of *dying* denoted by the word ‘*pretya*’)
is the person performing the *śrāddha*, whereas of the verb ‘*na* +
*asti*’ (‘is not’) the nominative is ‘*phala*,’ ‘reward’ \[and as a
rule, the nominative of the participle ‘*pretya*’ and the finite verb
‘*nāsti*’ should be one and the same\].”

In answer to this, some people explain that the term ‘*pretya*’ is an
independent word, an indeclinable noun, denoting *the other world* \[and
is not a participle at all\]. Another explanation is that of the root
*pra* + *in* also ‘reward’ is the nominative; the meaning of the
participle in this case being ‘*even though arriving near*,’ ‘it does
not come about,’—*i.e*., it fails to be enjoyed.—(139)
