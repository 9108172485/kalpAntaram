The rite done in honour of the gods is excelled by that done in honour
of the Pitṛs; *i.e*., the latter has been more emphatically enjoined.

This only indicates the predominance of the rite in honour of the Pitṛs;
the meaning being that the rite in honour of the gods is subsidiary to
that in honour of the Pitṛs.

This same subsidiary character is more clearly stated,—‘*The
rite*’—*i.e*., the feeding of Brāhmaṇas—‘*that is done in honour of the
gods*’ is the, ‘*sustainer*’—helper—‘*of the rite done in honour of the
Pitṛs*;’ so that it is not by itself an important act, being only an aid
of that in honour of the Pitṛs.—(203)
