‘*That has happened to come*’—*i.e*., who has come of his own accord,
and has not been invited; one who has been invited is not a ‘guest.’ The
proper place where the guest is to arrive shall be described later
on—‘where the wife and the Fires are, &c., &c.’ (103).

‘*Water and seat he should offer*;’—first of all he should offer water
for the washing of his feet, and then the seat; ‘*and also food*.’

‘*Prepared to the best of his ability*;’—this qualifies ‘food.’ The
meaning is that he should prepare the food with special care and then
offer it—feed him with it.

‘*According to rule*’—*i.e*., that offering which is
preceded—supported—by injunction; *i.e*., that which is sanctioned by
scripture.—(99)
