‘*Head*’—is the top-most place, known as the dwelling of the gods; on
this he should make the offering to Śrī; and ‘*on the feet*’—*i.e*., on
the lower side of the house—*Ho Bhadrakālī*;’ the place of dwelling of
this goddess being the East of the door.

Others have explained ‘*head*’ to mean that side of the householder’s
bed where his head lies; and the ‘*feet*’ to be the lower side of the
same. According to this explanation, this oblation may be placed either
on the bedstead or on the ground, on the spot where the householder’s
bed lies.

‘*For Brahman and Vāstoṣpati*.’—Even though these deities have been
coupled together in a copulative compound, yet the two oblations are
distinct, one to Brahman and another to Vāstoṣpati. In cases where two
gods together form the ‘deities,’—as in the case of ‘Agni-Soma’—the two
are taken together or conjointly; for example (*a*) ‘to the two
together’ (as mentioned in 85 above), and ‘to Heaven and Earth
conjointly’ (as mentioned in 86 above). The two mentioned here are to be
treated separately, as they are not known to be companions.

‘*Homestead*’ means the *house*; and it is in the centre of the house
that the offering is to be placed.—(89)
