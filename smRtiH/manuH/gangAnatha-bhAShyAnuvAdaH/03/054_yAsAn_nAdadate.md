The question being—“Does the mere act of receiving gifts from the
bridegroom make the marriage a *sale*?”—our answer is that it is not so;
it is when the ‘*relations*’ of the bride,—*i.e*., those in charge of
her—accept gifts for themselves, then alone it is ‘selling.’

‘*Means of honouring*’:—The receiving of presents on behalf of brides
becomes a means of honouring them; it raises the girls in their own
estimation; they come to think that ‘we are so good that we are being
married after receiving proper presents;’ they rise in the estimation of
the people also, who look upon such brides as very ‘handsomely
fortunate.’ Or, when out of the presents received ornaments are made for
them, and they are decked in them, they look beautiful.

‘*Harmless*’—it involves no sin; *i.e*., there is not the slightest
taint of sin in this act.

What this exaggerated statement indicates is that the accepting of
presents on behalf of the bride is permitted.—(54).
