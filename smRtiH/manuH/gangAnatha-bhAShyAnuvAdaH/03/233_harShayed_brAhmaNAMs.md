It has been said above (219) that—‘he shall make them eat very small
portions of the balls;’ and the present text lays down the time for this
feeding—and the place (from which the portion is to be drawn). The
portion is to be taken from the top of the ball; and this portion of the
ball should be offered after the Kuśa-blades and water and sesamum have
been offered.

‘*Saying—May this be svadhā to these*.’ The pronoun ‘these’ stands for
the individual names; the construction being—‘having pronounced the
names of the particular ancestor, he should say, *May this be svadhā to
him*.’ In this sense, the Dative should be used in connection with the
term ‘*svadhā*,’—the right form being—‘*svadhā Devadattaya astu*,’
‘*svadhā Yajñadattāya astu*,’ ‘may this be *svadhā to* Devadatta,’ ‘may
this be *svadhā* to Yajñadatta,’ and so forth.

By explaining our text thus, we do not run counter to other scriptural
injunctions.—(223)
