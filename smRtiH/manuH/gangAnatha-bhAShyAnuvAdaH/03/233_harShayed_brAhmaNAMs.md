Even if he has cause for grief, he should not show it, by heaving a
sigh, or in any other way; in fact, he should show himself quite happy.

‘*He should bring delight to the Brāhmaṇas*’—by means of songs and such
things sung by other persons; or, by means of such jokes as may be not
improper and be in keeping with the occasion. If the reciting of Vedic
texts were continued unceasingly, the Brāhmaṇas might begin to feel
bored; hence, now and again, he should cease and amuse the guests by
means of music, etc.

‘*He should feed them gently*;’—he should make them eat by addressing to
them such agreeable words as ‘Do take a few morsels, this dish is nice;’
and this should be done ‘*gently*’—not in a hurried or pressing
tone;—‘*with dishes*’—such as milk-rice, and the like.

‘*By means of seasonings*,’—when the seasonings are taken up for being
served, he should describe them as very tasty and thereby tempt the
guests to eat; saying such words as—‘these cakes are delicious, this
preparation of milk is highly flavoured;’ and taking the things in hand
and standing before each guest, he shall say such words again and again.
This is what constitutes ‘urging.’—(233)
