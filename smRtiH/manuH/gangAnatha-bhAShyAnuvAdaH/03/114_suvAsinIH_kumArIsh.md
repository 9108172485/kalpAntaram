The term ‘*Suvāsinī*’ stands for newly married girls, daughters as well
as daughters-in-law. Others have held that ‘girls whose father-in-law
and father are both living are called *Suvāsinī*, even after they have
given birth to children.’

‘*These......immediately after the guests*’—in continuation of them—‘*he
should feed*.’ That is, as soon as the guests have commenced eating,
they should be fed at the same time.

Others read ‘*agre*’ ‘*before*’ (the guests).

‘*Without hesitation*’—*i.e*., he should not entertain any doubt as to
the propriety of feeding youngsters before the guests have eaten.—(114)
