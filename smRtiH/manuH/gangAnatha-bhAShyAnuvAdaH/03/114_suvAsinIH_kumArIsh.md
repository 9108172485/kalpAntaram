‘*Waiting upon*’ means attending repeatedly. Some Brāhmaṇas wander from
house to house with a view to the fact that at such and such a house the
guest is sure to be fed; and it is this that is deprecated in the
present verse.

One who is in the habit of waiting upon the food cooked for others,—rand
not one who happens to do it only once by the way,—‘*on that
account*’—by reason of that act—‘*after death, cattle*’—are born as a
bull, &c., in the house of the ‘*givers of food*;’ *i.e*., are born as
his elephant, mule or horse.

This is a defect only in the Householder, who has established his own
domestic hearth.—(104)
