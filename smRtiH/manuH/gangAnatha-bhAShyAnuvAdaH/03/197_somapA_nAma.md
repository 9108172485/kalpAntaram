It has been explained what sort of Brāhmaṇas should be fed; now the
author proceeds to describe other details of procedure.

‘*On the preceding day*’—on the day preceding the one on which the
*śrāddha* is to be performed; *i.e*., if the performance falls on the
*Amāvāsyā* or the *Trayodaśī*, then on *Caturdaśī* or *Dvādaśī*,
respectively;—*i.e*., when one is going to perform the *Śrāddha*
to-morrow, one should invite the Brāhmaṇas to-day.

‘*On the next day*’—*i.e*., on the same day as the performance.

The option here laid down is in consideration of the rules: if one is
able to follow the rules closely, then one should do the inviting on the
previous day; but if one is unable to do so, then one may do it on the
same day. There is no doubt, however, that a strict observance of the
rules would bring great rewards.

When the invitation is made, the inviter is to be approached and urged
with entreaties.

Those of whom three is the least number,—this is what is meant by ‘*at
least three*.’ That is, the least number that should be fed is *three*;
in the event of his being able to feed more, ‘he should feed an odd
number, according to his enthusiasm,’—as has already been prescribed
above.

The rest of the words are meant only to fill up the verse.

‘*Approached*,’— arrived.

‘*Such as has been described*,’—*i.e*., mentioned above—(187)
