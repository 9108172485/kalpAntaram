When the Brāhmaṇas have dined and obtained permission to *go*, they
should pronounce the syllable ‘*svadhā*.’

*The syllable* ‘*svadhā*’—*i.e*., the utterance of the syllable
‘*svadhā*’—constitutes the ‘*highest benediction*’— at all rites
performed in honour of the Pitṛs;—those performed with cooked food as
well as those offered with uncooked food.—(252)
