title = "191 आमन्त्रितस् तु"

The term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ here stands for *woman* in general; this is
indicated by the fact that the invitee has been advised to observe
strict *continence* (and not only avoidance of improper intercourse).
Hence, in the present context, the Brāhmaṇa woman also is a ‘*vṛṣalī*;’
the term (in this sense) being etymologically explained as ‘she who
tempts her husband’ (*bhartāram vṛṣasyati*). Tims, what the passage
means is as follows:—Having accepted invitation, if the man dallies with
a woman,—*i.e*., with a view to having sexual intercourse with her,
engages in such nets as conversation, embracing, and so forth,—then he
incurs the following evil: whatever sin there might be in the ‘giver,’
*i.e*., the performer of the *Śrāddha*—passes on to him. What this
indicates is the coming about of undesirable results; if this were not
what is meant, then it would mean that there is nothing wrong in doing
this, in a case where the giver is a sinless person.

‘*Dallying*’ stands for obtaining pleasure; hence it follows that one
should not do even such acts as conversation, embracing, and the
like.—(191)
