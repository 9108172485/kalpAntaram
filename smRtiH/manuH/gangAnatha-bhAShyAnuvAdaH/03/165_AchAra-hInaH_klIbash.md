‘*Right* *conduct*’ stands here for the ordinary acts of courtesy, such
as offering worship to persons coming to one’s house, and so forth;—he
who is devoid of this.

^(‘)*Without vigour*’—*i.e*., with very little energy; who has lost all
enthusiasm for doing his duties.

‘*Constant beggar*’—one who is always begging, he who teases people by
his begging; it is in the very nature of things that begging should
displease the person bagged from. The term ‘*yācanakaḥ*’ is formed with
the ‘*yu*’ affix, according to Pāṇini 3.1.134, and then the reflexive
‘*ka’* added to it.

‘*He who lives by agriculture*’—by doing the cultivating himself; or
even by the cultivating done by others, if other means of living are
available.

‘*One suffering form elephantiasis*’—whose one leg is thicker than the
other,

‘*He who is spoken ill of by good men*’—the unfortunate man, who is
despised by good men, even without doing anything wrong.—(165)
