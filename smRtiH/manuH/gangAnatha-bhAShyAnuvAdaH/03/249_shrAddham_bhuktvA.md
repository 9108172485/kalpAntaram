‘*Pig*’—the village-hog.

Though it has been declared that ‘these shall not *look* at dose
quarters,’ yet what the cultured people avoid is these being near the
place. In verse 241 below also, the mention of an act (other than
*seeing*) in the passage ‘the pig spoils the food by *smelling*’ is a
purely deprecatory supplement. Certainly, there can be no *smelling* by
one who does not *see*.

In fact, the verse merely describes the things that may happen to be
near by; what is meant is the Injunction that, since, as a rule, the pig
is prone to sniff at the food, and the cock is prone to flapping its
wings, and so forth,—therefore, one should feed the Brāhmaṇas in a
sheltered place; and the purpose served by the present verse is that it
implies that, where there is no danger of such untoward happenings, the
feeding may be done in an unsheltered place also.

‘*Eunuch*’—One without the signs of masculinity.—(239)
