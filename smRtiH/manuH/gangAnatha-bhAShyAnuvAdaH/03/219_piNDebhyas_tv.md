Extremely small portions—parts of the ball offered to the Father should
be made to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇa who has been previously seated in
honour of the Father.

‘*In due order of sequence*’;—the meaning of this has been already
explained.

The pronoun ‘those’ refers to those mentiond in the present context;
and, it is in view of this that, in 212, our author has not thought it
necessary to specify the Brāhmaṇa as the one thus mentioned.

‘*Frst*’—*i.e*., before every other kind of food.—(219).
