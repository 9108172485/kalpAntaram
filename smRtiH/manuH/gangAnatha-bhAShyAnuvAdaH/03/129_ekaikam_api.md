What has been said above in regard to the ‘*most deserving Brāhmaṇa*’ is
further explained.

‘*By feeding at least one learned Brāhmaṇa, one obtains a full
reward*;—what is meant by ‘learning’ has already been explained; it
consists in knowing the Veda and its meaning; that this is so, is also
shown by what follows in the text: ‘*not by feeding even many men
ignorant of the Veda*;’ the term ‘*mantra*’ here stands for the *Veda*.

In the absence of *five* Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda, one should feed
at least one;—such is the meaning of the present injunction.

‘*Full*’—great, large.—(129)
