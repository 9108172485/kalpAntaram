‘*Ārakṣa*’ is the same as ‘*rakṣā*;’ and that which has reached that is
called ‘*ārakṣabhūtam*;’ *i.e*., that which serves the purpose of
protecting.

Or, the term ‘*bhūtam*’ may be taken as connoting *similitude*; in which
case, the meaning is—‘which is, as it were, a protection.’

Because it is so, therefore ‘*one should first engage*’—invite—‘*the
Brāhmaṇa in honour of the gods*’— and make him sit upon a proper seat.

The rest of the verse is a purely laudatory description.

‘*Rākṣasas*;’—certain invisible beings, described in *Itihāsas*—‘*take
away*’—the Śrāddha—from the Pitṛs.

“Who are the gods, in honour of whom the Brāhmaṇa is to be invited?”

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, we find the *mantra*—‘We invite the Viśvedevas,
&c.’—as the one to be used; from which it follows that the *Viśvedevas*
are the gods. In the *Purāṇas* also it is said—‘The *Śruti* says that it
is *Viśvedevas*.’—(204)
