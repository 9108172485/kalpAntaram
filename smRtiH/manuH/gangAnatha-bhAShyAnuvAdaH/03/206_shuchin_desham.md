All these, Daityas, &c., though not worthy of being mentioned in
scriptures, have been mentioned here for purposes of the laudatory
description. The forms and character of these beings are as described in
the *Itihāsas*.

‘*Suparṇas*’—are a particular kind of birds.

‘*Kinnaras*’—are horse-faced beings.

The purport of this laudatory description is that—so essential is the
performance of *Śrāddhas* that even Daityas, Dānavas and Rākṣasas, who
generally interfere with sacrificial performances, cannot avoid it; nor
even animals, who have no intelligence and no memory.

The sons of Atri are called ‘*Barhiṣads*.’— (196)
