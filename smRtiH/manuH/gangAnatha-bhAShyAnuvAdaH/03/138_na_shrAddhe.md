Even when endowed with the aforesaid qualifications of ‘Vedic learning’
and the rest, the man shall not be fed on account of his being a friend;
this is the prohibition contained in this verse.

‘*A* *friend*’—one whose happiness and unhappiness are the same as one’s
own, and who is in no way different from himself,—‘*one should not feed
at a Śrāddha*.’

‘*By means of riches*’— by means of other kinds of gifts—‘the
acquisition’ of the friend should be made; his friendship obtained; or
the benefit of ‘friendship’ may consist in *non-separation*.

It is not only the friend that one shall not feed; the enemy also should
not be fed. ‘*Him whom he regards neither as friend* *nor* *as foe*,’—
towards whom one eutertains feelings of neither affection, nor aversion:
in regard to whom there could be no suspicion of any relationship due to
affection or any other motive; the mention of the ‘friend or foe’ being
only illustrative. It is on account of the suspicion of such
relationship that the maternal grandfather and others have been
mentioned (in 147, 148 below) as secondary alternatives.

“There is possibility of the enemy being fed only where one wishes make
a friend of him; hence he also being included under ‘friend’ (should not
have been mentioned separately).”

The separate mention is expected to make the matter dearer.—(138)
