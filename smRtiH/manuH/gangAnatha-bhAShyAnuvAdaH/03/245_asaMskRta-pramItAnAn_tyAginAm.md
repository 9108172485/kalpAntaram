In connection with infants who have not completed their third year, it
is going to be said that ‘cremation shall not be performed for him;’ it
is these that are spoken of here as ‘*those who have died without
sacraments*.’

‘*The remnant*’—contained in the dishes; as also ‘*what is scattered on
the Kuśa*’ forms their ‘*share*’ The term ‘*bhāgadheya*’ is the same as
‘*bhāga*.’

This does not mean that these persons are not helped by the *śrāddha*.

^(‘)*Those who* *hare* *abandoned*’—their elders. Or, ‘those who have
abandoned the ladies of their family, without finding any fault in
them.’ According to the former explanation, the term ‘*Kulayoṣitām*’ is
to be construed by itself, and taken to mean ‘unmarried maidens.’

For the reason stated, the remnant should be offered to the persons
mentioned.

It would not be right to raise the question—“Since the remnant would be
unclean, how could it be offered as the said share?”—because, in view of
this very text, there is no uncleanliness attaching to the remnant; just
as there is none in the case of the remnant of Soma-juice (at the
Soma-sacrifices).—(245)
