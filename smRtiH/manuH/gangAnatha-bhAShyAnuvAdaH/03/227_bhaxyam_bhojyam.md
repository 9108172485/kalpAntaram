Having placed the balls on the kuśa-grass, he should turn towards the
North, leftwards; since we read in another *Smṛti*—‘turning to the left,
towards the north.’

Seated with his face towards the North, he should sip water. ‘*Having
sipped water*’— he should perform ‘breath-suppression’ three times;
*e.g*., simply supressing the breath three times—only this much;—the
rule relating to the repeating of the *Gāyatrī* verse along with the
‘*Śiras*’ formula (Yājña. *Ācāra* 23) not applying to the present case.

‘*Gently*’—so that there may not he much pain. This is what has been
asserted (elsewhere) in the words—‘having suppressed the breathing as
much as one can.’

Still facing the North, he should salute, &c., &c.—saying, ‘Salutation
to the spring!’ and so forth.

He should also salute the Pitṛs; ‘*with proper formulas* with the
*mantra*, ‘*Na* *mo vaḥ pitaraḥ*, &c., &c.’ This saluting of the Pitṛs
should be done with face turned towards the Balls; for another *Smṛti*
says that this is to be done by ‘turning round.’—(217).
