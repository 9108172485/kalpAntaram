‘*Forbidden days*’—*i.e*., the six mentioned above.

‘*Other eight days*’—which have not been forbidden.

He who avoids women on these days, and has recourse to her on the
remaining two days—avoiding the sacred days—then ‘*he remains a
religious student etc*.’—*i.e*., he obtains the fruits of continence.

‘*In whatever stage of life he may happen to be*,’—this is an
exaggeration. Certainly, intercourse with women on two days could never
be permitted for the Recluse; for the simple reason that it has been
strictly enjoined that one should keep one’s sexual organs in complete
check, in all stages of life, except that.of the Religious Student. As
for the repetition (in the phrase, ‘*yatra tatra*’), this is explicable
as occurring in an exaggerated statement.

The text does not menu that the fourteen days are to be avoided in the
order in which they are mentioned; all that is meant is that one should
not think that one may have intercourse whenever one chooses, only
leaving off the sacred days; and it is in this sense that only two days
have been permitted.

“What is the fruit of *continence*?”

Since we do not find any particular fruit mentioned (as resulting from
continence), it must be taken to be Heaven. But in some places we find
it asserted that ‘the student observing the vow of continence never
incurs sin;’ which means that he is not tainted by sins accruing from
minor transgressions.
