It has been said above that the occasion for each of the Five Sacrifices
is distinct, and all of them do not form an aggregate; this same idea is
made clear by this verse.

When, by reason of poverty or some other cause, the necessary supplies
being not available, the honouring of guests and such other acts be not
possible, then one should be constantly engaged in Vedic Study.

‘*In acts in honour of the gods*’—the offering made in fire to the
Vaiśvadeva gods are ‘acts done in honour of the gods.’ Though the
‘sacrifice to elementals’ and ‘sacrifice to Pitṛs’ are all ‘in honour of
gods,’ yet from the context it is clear that it is the offering in fire
that is meant by the term ‘acts done in honour of gods.’

A commendatory exaggeration is added—‘*He who is engaged in*’—*i.e*.,
busy with—‘*acts in honour of the gods, upholds*’—*i.e*., supports—‘*the
moveable and immoveable*;’—*i.e*., he becomes the means of sustenance of
the entire world.—(75)
