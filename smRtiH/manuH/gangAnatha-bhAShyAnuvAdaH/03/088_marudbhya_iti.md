The particle ‘*iti*’ is meant to lay stress upon the exact form of the
words to be used.

‘*In water*’—this specifies the receptacle of the offering; and ‘*to
Apas*’ indicates the deity to whom the offering is to be made.

‘*Saying “this to Vanaspatis,” on the pestle and mortar*; the singular
number in the Copulative Compound ‘*musalolūkhale*’ would indicate that
the two things are not two optional alternative receptacles; and, since
two receptacles are mentioned, the right. course would appear to be that
there should be a repetition of the oblation, which is the principal
factor; specially, as it is not possible for the pestle and the mortar
to be unified and then serve as a receptacle for the offering; as the
two will ever remain distinct; they can never be mixed up like milk and
water; so that if the oblation is poured on the mortar, it is not poured
on the pestle; and if it is poured on the pestle, it is not poured on
the mortar; nor is it possible for the oblation to be poured in parts
(over the two receptacles); as the exact quantity of the oblation has
been fixed by law. With all this, in view of the copulative compound, it
appears best that the oblation should be poured on one of the two things
mentioned (*i.e*., either on the pestle or on the mortar).—(88)
