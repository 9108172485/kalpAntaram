Whatever food, vegetable or drink they may ask for,—all this he shall
give ‘*ungrudgingly*’—without the least hesitation or covetousness. The
term ‘*matsara*’ stands here for *avarice*.

‘*Be agreeable to*’—*i.e*., cause pleasure to.

‘*Told in the Veda*’—those that are related in the Veda; such, *e.g*.,
as the story of the war between the gods and demons, that of the death
of Vṛttra, the doings of Saramā, and so forth. Or, it may stand for such
stories as ‘*Kaḥ svidekākī charati*,’ etc. (Vājasaneya Saṃhitā, 23.9).

Another reading is ‘*brahmādyāśca kathāḥ*’—*i.e*., discourses, in
ordinary language, upon the meaning of mantras bearing upon Brahman.

‘*This is liked by the Pitṛs*;’—this is a commendatory supplement.—(231)
