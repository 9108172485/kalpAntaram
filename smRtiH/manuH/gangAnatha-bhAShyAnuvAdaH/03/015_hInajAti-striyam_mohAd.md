This is a deprecatory exhortation, supplementing the foregoing
prohibition.

‘*Of the lout caste*’—*i.e*., of the Śūdra caste; the *Śūdra girl* being
the subject of consideration; and further, because the statement ends
with the assertion that the families along with offspring are reduced to
the position *of the Śūdra*.

‘*The twice-born men*, *through infatuation*’—*i.e*., on account of
folly arising from greed for wealth, or from lust,—‘*reduce their
families to the position of the Śūdra*.’ That is, sons born of that wife
become *Śūdras*, and so also grandsons and great-grandsons descended
from them. Hence, it is added—‘*along with their offspring*’—the term
‘*offspring*’ standing for the line of descendants, consisting of sons,
grandsons, &c.—(15).
