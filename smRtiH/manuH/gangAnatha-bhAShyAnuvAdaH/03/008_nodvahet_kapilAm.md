The prohibition in the preceding verse was with regard to the family of
the bride; while that in the present verse pertains to her body.

The girl whose hairs are of either tawny or golden colour is called
‘*kapilā*.’

‘*With superfluous limbs*’—*e.g*., having six fingers.

‘*Who has disease*’—who is suffering from many diseases, or is overtaken
by some incurable disease;—the possessive affix having the sense of
*many* or Of *permanence*.

‘*Who has no hair*’—‘*loman*’— standing for *hairs* in general also.
What the present qualification has in view, however, is the entire
absence of hair in the arm-pits and between the thighs.

‘*Garrulous*’—who talks much and disagreeably, when it is necessary to
speak very little.

‘*With reddish eyes*’—Whose eyes are red, on account of some
disease.—(8)
