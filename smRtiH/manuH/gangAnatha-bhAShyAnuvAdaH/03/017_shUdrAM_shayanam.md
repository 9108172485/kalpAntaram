This is a laudatory exaggeration.

If on the Śūdra wife he begets a son, *he falls from Brāhmaṇahood itself
i.e*., the son becomes a non-Brāhmaṇa. This also is a deprecatory
exaggeration.

‘*Son*’—is in the masculine gender. So that (in the preceding verse
also) the term ‘*begetting of children*,’ ‘*sutotpattyā*,’ should be
taken to refer to the *male* child; even though in the compound the word
can be taken both ways—either as ‘*sutā*’ in the Feminine, or as
‘*suta*’ in the Masculine. It is with this view that we have pointed out
above that what is prohibited is intercourse with the woman on the even
days of her ‘period’ (as it is only by intercourse on those days that a
male child is born).—(17).
