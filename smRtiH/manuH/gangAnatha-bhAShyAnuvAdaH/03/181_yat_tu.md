This also is to be explained as the preceding verse.

It is the *feeding* of the Trader that is prohibited, not his proximity
to the place; because there is no ground for taking the words of the
present verse as conveying this latter sense, as there was in the case
of a previous verse (177), where the term, ‘by looking,’ was taken as
indirectly indicating ‘visible place,’ and hence prohibiting the man’s
proximity to the place.

The man ‘*born of the a remarried woman*’ shall be described later on,
under discourse 9 (verse 175)—(181)
