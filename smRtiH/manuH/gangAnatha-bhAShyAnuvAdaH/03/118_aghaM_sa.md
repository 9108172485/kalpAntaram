Food cooked for all is referred to here by the term ‘*Vaiśvadeva*;’ on
this being ‘*finished*’—*i.e*., all persons having eaten, and the food
having been exhausted,—if another guest should arrive, then for him also
he shall provide cooked food; but out of this latter food, he shall not
make the offering that is made out of food that is cooked in the
household.

The oblation into the tire also—and not only the *offering*—is not to be
made (out of this food); because oblations and offerings have been laid
down as to be made out of the food cooked in the morning and evening,
and not out of the intervening cookings; as is going to be asserted
below (in verse 121). So that, if one happens to cook several times
during the day, he should not repeat the *Vaiśvadeva* offering with each
cooking.

‘*To the best of his ability*’—*i.e*., with elaborate seasonings or
otherwise.—(108)
