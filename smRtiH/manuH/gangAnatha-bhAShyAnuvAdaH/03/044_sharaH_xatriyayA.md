When being wedded by a *Brāhmaṇa*, ‘*the Kṣatriya girl should take hold
of*’ the arrow held in the hand of the Brāhmaṇa bridegroom; the arrow
having been prescribed in place of the ‘taking of the hand.’

‘*Goad*’—of oxen; it is made of iron, on being driven by which they
suffer pain; just like the ‘*aṅkuśa*’ in the case of. elephants.

‘*Of* *the garment*’—of the cloth,—‘the hem should be taken hold of by
the *Śūdra* girl, when being married to men of the *Brāhmaṇa* and other
higher castes. (44)
