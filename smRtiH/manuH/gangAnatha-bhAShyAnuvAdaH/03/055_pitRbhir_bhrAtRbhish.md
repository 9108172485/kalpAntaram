The bride’s relations are not only to receive presents for her from the
bridegroom; they themselves shall make presents to her.

‘*Fathers*’—through association, the term ‘father’ here includes the
grandfather, uncle, etc., also; hence the plural number; or, the plural
number may be explained as referring to several individual brides.

Similarly, ‘*husbands*’ may stand for father-in-law, &c.; or, it may
refer to several individual girls.

‘*Brothers-in-law*’—the husband’s brothers.

‘*Shall be honoured*’—during rejoicings in connection with the birth of
sons, &c., they should be invited, welcomed and received with honour and
feasting.

‘*Shall be adorned*’—should be decked with clothes, ornaments, unguents,
and so forth.

The effect of all this is next indicated—‘*welfare* what is desirable,
*i.e*., being endowed with children, wealth, &c., good health, freedom
from troubles, and so forth: Those who are desirous of all this—*i.e*.,
of obtaining all this (should do what is said above).

The injunction contained in this verse has been set forth for the
purpose of indicating this reward.—(55)
