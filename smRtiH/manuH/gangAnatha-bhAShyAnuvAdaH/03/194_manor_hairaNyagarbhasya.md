‘*Foremost*’—most excellent; who have carefully made the Vedas their own
by having all doubts regarding them set aside.

‘*Foremost also in all the explanatory sciences*’—*i.e*., the subsidiary
sciences which serve to explain what is contained in the Veda. That is,
those persons, who have learnt, and are learning, the Veda along with
the six subsidiary sciences.

‘*Those who are born in the family of men learned in the Veda*’—*i.e*.,
those whose father and grandfather, etc., are also equally learned in
the Veda and the subsidiary sciences.

“It is persons such as these that have been mentioned as fit for being
fed; what further excellence is here mentioned, by virtue of which these
men are described as ‘sanctifiers of company?’”

It has been laid down above that food should be given to one possessed
of even slight knowledge, only if he happens to be learned in the Veda.
In the present instance, however, mere learning is not mentioned as the
only condition of being a ‘Sanctifier of Company.’ In fact, this latter
character of being a ‘Sanctifier of Company’ is dependent upon the
presence of special qualifications; and hence it cannot be right to
accept it in cases of lower qualifications. Thus the present verse is
meant to sanction the giving of food to one who is simply learning the
Veda, in the absence of fully learned persons. So that, in the absence
of the fully learned man, the giving of food to one who is learning the
Veda is the first course to be adopted, and not merely a secondary one.

The plural number is used, in view of the individual men.

The particle ‘*ca*’ has the cumulative sense.—(184)
