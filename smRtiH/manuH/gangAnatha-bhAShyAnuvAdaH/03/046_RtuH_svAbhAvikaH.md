title = "046 ऋतुः स्वाभाविकः"

The verse is meant to provide a definition of ‘season;’ and what is
stated here is based upon medical science, not upon any scriptural
injunctions. Similarly, the two verses beginning with the
*forty-eighth*.

‘*Sixteen days*,’ in every month, constitute the ‘natural season’ for
women. That ‘every month’ is meant, we gather from other sources, though
it is not mentioned in this verse.

‘*Normal*’—what comes by nature; *i.e*., what happens in the case of
women in normal health; in cases of disease and such other causes, the
flow is absent even when the time has arrived; and by means of such
medicines as butter and sesamum, and so forth, or by excessive sexual
intercourse, the flow is brought on even before time. Hence the sixteen
days are called the ‘normal season.’

‘*Including the four days*’—the four days that are censured by all good
men, during which the touching of, and conversing with, the woman has
been prohibited; these are the four days beginning with the first day on
which the flow of blood becomes visible. ‘*Day*’ stands for ‘day and
night.’
