That une should always give food to one in want of it, according to his
means—(having been declared in the preceding verses), the present verse
supplies another incentive.

The reward that one obtains by giving a cow to the Teacher is obtained
by giving alms ; *i.e*., it does not differ in any way from that of the
giving of a cow. In another *Smṛti*, the giving of the cow has been
described as buying ‘all rewards,’ and also as ‘freeing from all sins.’
Whenever a text declares that same rewards follow from the rendering of
small help und of greater help, we should understand that there will be
a difference in the quantity, as there is in ordinary life. That is, the
same reward is obtained, but it does not continue for an equally long
time. \[There must be some such difference\] for there is the well-known
maxim—‘what wise man will buy with ten pice a thing that can be obtained
for only one?’ If the results in the two casus were really *equal* in
all respects, then there would be no use in undertaking the work that
requires u greater effort.

Some people read ‘*gāndatvā guryathāvidhi*’ (‘by the person without cows
giving a cow’); and in this case, the negative particle (in the compound
‘*aguḥ*,’ ‘without cows’) means *few*; *i.e*., one who possesses only a
few cows.

‘*Merit*’ is meritorious act; the reward of this.—(95)
