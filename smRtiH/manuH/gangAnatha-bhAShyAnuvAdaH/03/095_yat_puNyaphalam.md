The term ‘*first*’ is a mere reiterative reference; that the offering to
Agni is to be made first of all being already indicated by the order in
which the names are mentioned. These two offerings are to be distinct
(one to each); while the next is to the two together—the formula used
being ‘*agnīsomābhyām svāhā*.’ For the next, the formula is ‘*viśvebhyo
devebhyaḥ, svāhā*.’ Only one offering is to be made with the words,
‘*Dhanvantaraye svāhā*,’—(85)
