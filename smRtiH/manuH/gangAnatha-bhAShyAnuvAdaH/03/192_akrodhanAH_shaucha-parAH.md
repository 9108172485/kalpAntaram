‘*Free from anger*’—without wrath.

‘*Intent on purity*,’—‘purity’ standing either for external purity
obtained by means of clay and water, or internal purity obtained by
means of expiatory rites.

‘*Ever*’—qualifies ‘purity.’ Hence the meaning is that, whenever one
happens to spit or do any such unclean act, one should rinse one’s mouth
immediately.

‘*Chaste*’—avoiding all intercourse with women.

‘*Rid of all means of offence*—those by whom the means of offence have
been laid aside. ‘Offence’ stands for roughness and strife of all kinds.

‘*Supremely blessed*;’—‘blessedness’ consists in the presence of such
qualities as nobility, prosperity, and so forth.

Since it is in all this form that the Pitṛs enter into the body of the
Brāhmaṇas,—therefore, the Brāhmaṇas also should assume these same
forms;—this is what is enjoined by means of the commendatory description
contained in the verse.

‘*Foremost gods*.’—That in another time-cycle the ancestors were gods,
is an eulogium bestowed on the ancestors. They are called ‘*foremost*’
because they are worshipped *before* the gods.—(192)
