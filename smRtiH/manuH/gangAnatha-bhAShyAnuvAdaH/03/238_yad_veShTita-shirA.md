‘*Wound up*’—with turban and such other things. The Northerners cover
their heads with cloth.

Some people explain that this refers also to persons who cover their
heads with their hairs Arranged in the form of a top-knot. Rut what they
say is not reasonable; as, in this case, it is the *hair* that is ‘wound
up,’ not the *head*; and the *hairs* do not form the *head*; in fact,
they are *on the head*. The prohibition does not apply to threads and
such things; as such things are not regarded as ‘covering’ the head.

What is meant by indicating the facing of the south as defective is
that, when there is want of space, eating with face towards all
directions *except the south* is permissible. If this were not meant,
where would there be any possibility of anyone eating with face to the
south, when it has been distinctly enjoined that one should eat facing
the north?

‘*Shoes*’—foot-guards made of leather. Some people explain this as
sandals of leather.

‘*The demons eat*,’—and not the Pitṛs.

This is deprecatory of the conditions described.—(238)
