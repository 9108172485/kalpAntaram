That the gift that is presented to the learned person makes the *givers*
partakers of reward is only right: but what is the reward obtained by
the receivers? If it be held that they obtain some transcendental
result,—that, cannot be right: because the act of *receiving* gifts has
not been so enjoined, and also because the receiver is prompted to
accept the gift only with a view to the perceptible reward. If, on the
other hand, the reward to the *receiver* be held to be something
perceptible,—then such a reward is found to be obtained by the ignorant
person also.”

True; but what is stated here is mere praise; the sense lasing that—‘the
presenting of offerings to the learned man is so effective that the
*receiver* also comes to partake of the imperceptible reward, in
addition to the perceptible one,—what to say of the *giver*.’

‘*Alter death*’— in heaven.

‘*Here*’—the reward is in the form of fame; the man being praised by men
as doing things in exact accordance with the scriptures,

‘*According to rule*;’—this is a mere reiterative reference to the
injunction that ‘gifts should be made to persons posessing such and such
qualifications.’—(143)
