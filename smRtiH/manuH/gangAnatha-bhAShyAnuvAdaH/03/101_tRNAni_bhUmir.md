If, through poverty, one is unable to provide food,—even then one should
not entertain such thoughts as these—‘feeding is the chief factor in the
honouring of a guest; this is not possible in my case; why then should I
let him enter my house?’ Because for one who is incapable of doing
anything else, even the providing of ‘grass,’ &c., would constitute the
act of ‘honouring the guest.’ Or, the meaning may be that the providing
of food alone does not constitute the full compliance with the
injunction of ‘honouring the guest;’ one has to provide bedding, &c.,
also.

‘*Grasses*’—stands for *bedding*.

‘*Place*’—*i.e*., space for sitting, sleeping and moving about.

‘*Kind words*’—*i.e*., words, sweet as well as wholesome; in the form of
conversation and stories, &c.

In the absence of food,’ ‘*even these never fail*’—*i.e*., are always
provided—‘*in the house of good people*.’—(101)
