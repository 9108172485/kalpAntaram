Having taken up some food in a vessel, he should place food on the
ground, with a view to benefit the dogs and the rest.

‘*Persons afflicted with filthy diseases*’—Lepers, consumptives, and so
forth.

‘*Vayāṃsi*’—birds.

‘*Gently*’—*i.e*., in such, a way that the food does not become mixed
with the dust raised from the ground.

The ‘*ground*’ has been mentioned, not with a view to preclude the use
of a vessel, but simply to indicate that food for the Cāṇḍāla, the
outcast and the leper should not be given in their hands.

What the present verse prescribes is the *according of help*; that is
why the verse contains the Genitive, not the Dative, ending.

For the birds, food should be placed on a spot where they can eat it
without being scared away by dogs, &ç.

For *insects*, the food should be placed on a spot where they are likely
to be present.—(92)
