While he is dealing with the subject of ‘supersession,’ the author
proceeds to state its prohibition by showing the evil that befalls all
persons connected with it.

He who is passed over, insulted, by the marriage is the ‘*superseded
elder brother*;’ and he who does the passing over of the elder brother
is ‘*the superseding younger brother*;’—that girl through whom the
superseding is done;—‘*all these go to hell*.’

The ‘*giver*’ and the officiating priest form the fifth of those that go
to hell. The ‘*giver*’ meant here must be that of the girl, her father
and other guardians; that such is the meaning is clear from the context.

The ‘*officiating priest*’ is one who performs the *Homa* in marriage,
or he who guides the ceremony. Or, it may mean ‘one who officiates as
priest at the performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other sacrifices by
the aforesaid four persons—the superseded elder brother, the superseding
younger brother, the girl that is married, and he who gives her away.’

For this reason, the elder brother should act in such a manner that he
does not form an obstacle in the marriage of his younger brother; and
the younger brother also should wait for twelve, eight or six years; and
the girl also should not allow herself to be given away to such a
person;

The compound ‘*dātṛyājakapañcamāḥ*’ is to be expounded as a *Bahuvrīhi*,
containing *Dvandva*: a ‘*Dātṛyājakau (Dvandva) pañcamau yeṣām*’
(Bahuvrīhi).—(172)
