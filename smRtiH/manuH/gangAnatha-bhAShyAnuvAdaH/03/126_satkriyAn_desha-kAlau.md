Since ‘large company’ entails all these defects, therefore ‘large
company’ is not considered desirable. When, however, respectful
treatment and the rest are found feasible, then one might net according
to one’s enthusiasm.

‘*Respectful treatment*’—careful preparation of the food.

‘*Place*’—ground sloping to the south, and so forth (which has been
recommended for *Śrāddhas*), as one going to be described below (in
207).

‘*Time*’—the afternoon; laid dowu in such texts as ‘when the sun has
just passed the meridian, &c.’

‘*Purity*’—of oneself, of the Brāhmaṇas invited, and of his own
servants.

‘*Qualities of Brāhmaṇas*’—the obtaining of qualified Brāhmaṇas.

All these advantages are such as must be secured; and these are hampered
by having a large company; hence large company becomes a drawback; and
this is involved in inviting too many Brāhmaṇas. *Hence ‘one should not
seek*’—bring together—‘*a large company*.’— (126)
