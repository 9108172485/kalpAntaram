Inasmuch as the meaning of the term ‘*Atithi*’ (guest) is not well-known
among men, the author provides a definition of the same.

One becomes a ‘guest’ by staying in another man’s house for one night;
and this character belongs only to a Brāhmaṇa, to none else.

Whether the next day also the guest should be honoured or not, depends
upon the wish of the Householder; it is not. obligatory. It being done
by persons desiring prosperity, the incentive to it is something totally
different (from that of the obligatory honouring during the first
night). Says Apastamba (2.7.16)—‘One should lodge him for one night;’
whereby he wins the regions of the earth; by keeping him on the second
night, the regions of the sky; and on the third night, the regions of
Heaven”—which shows that the incentive to the entertaining of the guest
on the second and following nights consists in the desire for particular
rewards.

For the purpose of lending strength to the above explanation, the author
provides the etymological meaning—‘*His stay is not long*; which means
that the word ‘*atithi*’ is derived from the root ‘*sthā*’ (to stay),
preceded by ‘*ati*;’ the term being formed somehow by the addition of an
*Uṇādi* affix.—(102)
