‘*Forcibly*;’—*i.e*., having subdued the guardians of the girl, if one
carries her away by force, this is called the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ form. This is
all that is meant to be stated here. ‘*Having beaten*,’ etc., is a mere
descriptive re-iteration; for it is always understood that, while the
bridegroom is forcibly taking away the girl, if some one seeks to stop
him, he shall beat them and do the rest of it. But if, knowing the great
strength of the abductor, her guardians, through fear, let her go,—then
also it is a Rākṣasa form of marriage; and it is not a necessary
condition of this form that the *beating*, *etc*., must be done.

‘*Having beaten*’—by means of sticks, etc.

‘*Wounded*’— cutting limbs by strokes of the sword and other weapons.

‘*Pierced*’—walls and forts.

‘*Crying out and weeping*;’—*i.e*., unwilling girl. This is what
distinguishes this from the ‘*Gāndharva*’ form. ‘*Crying out*’ stands
for such loud wailings as—‘there is none to protect me, I am being taken
away, save me,’ and so forth: while ‘*weeping*’ stands for shedding
tears, which is the characteristic of all frightened women.—(33)
