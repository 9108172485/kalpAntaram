The balls having been disposed of, he should wash his hands; and then
follow the rules regarding sipping of water.

‘*Jñatiprāyam*’—is to be explained as ‘that which goes to (*praiti*) to
the paternal relations (*jñātiṣu*);’ this he should make; *i.e*., he
should offer food to them.

‘*Having treated than well*, *he should feed other relations*.’ Those
belonging to the same ‘*gotra*’ are called ‘*jñati*,’ ‘paternal
relations,’ while those related on the mother’s and the wife’s side are
called ‘*bāṇḍhava*,’ ‘releations.’

The following question is here raised:—

“It has been said above (in verse 253) that ‘he should do us they tell
him;’ now if they were to tell him, ‘Send all this food to our home,’
then, what would become of the *Vaiśvadeva* and other oblations?”

In that case, the man will have to cook food again. Or, the offering of
the remnant to the Brāhmaṇas may be regarded as being prescribed only
with a view to some transcendental result,—and not with a view to their
actually taking it all away. For instance, it has been laid down that —‘
When informed of food having been left, they should say *it is for your
friends*;’ and this direction would have to be regarded as only
optional, if, in certain cases, the Brāhmaṇas were to take away the
food.—(264)
