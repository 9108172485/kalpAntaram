What is said here is with reference to the thirteenth day of the month
spoken of above, as accompanied by the rainy season and the asterism of
*Maghā*.

What is described in the text is the wish expressed by the Pitṛs.

‘*May there be*’—born—‘*in our famity*’—one such person, endowed with
excellent qualities, who may offer to us, on the said thirteenth day,
‘*milk-rice mixed with honey and butter*;’—also ‘*when the shadow of the
elephant falls towards the east*;’ *i.e*., during the afternoon; towards
the close of day, the shadow cast by the elephant is long and falls
towards the East.

Another reading for ‘*prākchāyā*’ is ‘*prākchāyām*;’ it is in a shady
place that Brāhmaṇas are fed; as for the rest of the rite, if the shade
is not enough to permit of its being done there, then it should be done
in a place close to the shadow. Since the details form part of the rite,
the whole of it should, as far as possible, be performed in the shadow
of the elephant.

Some people have explained the term ‘shadow of the elephant’ to mean
‘eclipse,’ adding that Rāhu takes the shape of the elephant and pierces
the sun with darkness.

But this is not right; as in that case, the term ‘elephant’ will have to
ba regarded as figurative. Further, in another *Smṛti* the ‘elephant’s
shadow’ has been described as something entirely different from
eclipse:—‘the elephant’s shadow, the eclipse of the Sun, and the eclipse
of the Moon’ \[where the three are mentioned as distinct from one
another\].—(274)
