Those that have the character of guests are said to arrive ‘*in the
character of guests*;’ the ‘character of the guest’ has been already
described.

‘*Family*’—House.

‘*Arrived*’—Come.

He should feed the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra* also, like the *Kṣatriya*.
The time, for feeding them is after the quests, relations and friends
have eaten, but before the House-holder and his wife.

‘*Along with*’ means simply ‘at the same time.’

‘*Compassionate disposition*’—sympathy, pity.

‘*Showing*’—providing proof of, having recourse to.

This last clause has been added with a view to show that those here
mentioned are not objects of respect. It is one who is to be kindly
treated that deserves compassion, and not one who is to be worshipped.
Towards pergons deserving kindly treatment, if help can be accorded,
this is done by everyone who desires his own welfare. But its omission
does not mean ill-treatment of the guest. What is meant is that the
merit derived from helping the person deserving compassion is not
similar to that derived from entertaining the guest; it is inferior to
this latter.—(112)
