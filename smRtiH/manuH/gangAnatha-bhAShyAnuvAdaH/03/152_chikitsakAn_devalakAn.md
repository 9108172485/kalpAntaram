‘*Healers* physicians.

^(‘)*Temple-attendants*’—those who attend upon idols.

These two are prohibited only as means of living. Healing and serving
idols, when done entirely with a righteous motive (and not as a means of
living), are not reprehensible.

‘*Meat-sellers*’—Butchers.

If we read these words with the Accusative ending, then they have to be
construed with the verb of the preceding verse.

‘*Those living by trade*’—*i.e*., by improper trade; improper
merchandise shall be described under Discourse 10,—those who live by
such trade.

‘*Should be avoided*’—at both kinds of rites.

Meat-selling is reprehensible, even when done with a *righteous* motive.
For instance, when one man has *got* meat and another man has need for
it;—the former man who has got the meat stands in need *of* butter for
oblations; *and he exchanges his* meat with the other man’s butter;
*this exchange is done* ‘with a righteous motive,’ and *exchange also is
called* ‘selling;’ *hence* those also *become* excluded who do such
meat-selling, even with a righteous motive.—(152)
