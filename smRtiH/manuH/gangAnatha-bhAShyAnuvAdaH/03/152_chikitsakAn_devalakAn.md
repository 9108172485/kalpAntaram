‘*Barren soil*’—Unproductive ground. that plot of land is called
‘barren’ on which if seed is sown, it does not sprout; there the ‘*sower
reaps no harvest*.’

‘*Even so*,’ ‘*to the person ignorant of die Veda*’—‘*having given the
offerings* made to gods and ancestors,—‘*the giver obtains no reward*.’

The term ‘*anṛce*’ is with the Locative ending; and the term ‘*ṛk*’
stands for the *Veda* in general.—(142)
