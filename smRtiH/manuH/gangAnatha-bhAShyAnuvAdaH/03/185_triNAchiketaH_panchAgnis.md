The plural number in ‘*prāṇinaḥ*,’ ‘*creatures*,’ is according to Pāṇini
1.2,58.

These people do not deserve the names of ‘*Brāhmaṇa*,’ and the rest; and
they only deserve to be called ‘creatures;’ they are not worthy of any
other name. For this reason, they ‘*cause the destruction of the
offerings to gods and Pitṛs*;’—*i.e*.,. they render them fruitless—‘*for
the givers*’—those who give it to them.

The terms ‘*parivettṛ*’ (superseder) and the rest are not sufficiently
well known in ordinary usage; nor are they capable of being
etymologically analysed. Hence, the author has provided the definition
of these.—(175)
