The rite in honour of the Pitṛs should not be looked upon as inferior to
that in honour of the gods; in fact, the former is the more important of
the two; because by birth, the Pitṛs are elder than the gods. For, the
order of creation is that the Pitṛs were born from the sages, and the
gods were born from the Pitṛs, and from the gods, the whole of the rest
of the world—‘*moveable*’—animate—as well as ‘*immoveable*’—inanimate.

‘*In* *due order*’—the order having been already described under
Discourse I.

The entire series of purely laudatory descriptions has now come to an
end.—(201)
