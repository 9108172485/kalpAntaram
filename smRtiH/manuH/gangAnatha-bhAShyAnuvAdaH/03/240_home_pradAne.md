This verse is supplementary to what has gone before in the preceding
verse.

The shedding of tears, when done, makes the Śrāddha-offering go—*i.e*.,
sends it—to ‘*ghosts*’; and it does not become helpful to the Pitṛs. The
term ‘*preta*,’ ‘ghost,’ here stands for a particular class of beings,
of the same kind as *Piśācas*; and not. for persons recently dead and
not yet joined to their ancestors.

‘*Demons*’—also should be understood in the same manner as ‘ghosts.’

‘*Enemies*’—well-known.

‘*Sinners*’—People addicted to sinful deeds.—(230)
