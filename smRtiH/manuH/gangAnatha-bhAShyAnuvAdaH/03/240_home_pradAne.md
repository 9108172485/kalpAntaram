propitiatory offerings.

‘*At gifts*’—of such valuable things as the cow, gold and so forth—made
for the purpose of attaining prosperity.

‘*Feeding*’—where Brāhmaṇas are fed for a religious purpose.

‘*Rite in honour of the gods*’—such the as offering at the
*Darśa-pūrṇamāsa* and other sacrifices.

‘*Rite in honour of the Pitṛs*’—*i.e.*, *Śrāddha*.

‘*Goes wrong*,’—that is, it brings about results contrary to what it was
intended for.

Though *Śrāddha* forms the subject-matter of the present context, yet,
through syntactical connection, the present prohibition applies to other
acts also, in the shape of the *offering into fire* and so forth.—(240)
