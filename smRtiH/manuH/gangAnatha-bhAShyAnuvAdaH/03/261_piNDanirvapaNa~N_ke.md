After food, drink and water for sipping have been offered, the guests
should be questioned—with the words ‘have you eaten well?’

According to another *Smṛti*, the question should be put by the host,
food in hand. It is the nature of some people that if the food is not
near at hand, they do not ask for it, even though they may have desire
for it, fearing the trouble they would cause; but if the food is close
by, they take it.

‘*After they have been fully satisfied, he shall make them wash*.’

Others have explained this to mean that the guests should be put the
question—‘Are you fully satisfied?’ And when they have ascertained the
fact of their having been fully satisfied, they should be further
propitiated by the question—‘Have you dined well?’ It is going to be
declared (under 254) that ‘at the rite in honour of the Pitṛs one should
say *Have you dined well?*’

‘*When they ham washed, he shall say &c*.’—‘*Where you choose*’—*i.e*.,
at either of the two places,—here or at your own house, you may take
your rest, in any manner you choose.—(251)
