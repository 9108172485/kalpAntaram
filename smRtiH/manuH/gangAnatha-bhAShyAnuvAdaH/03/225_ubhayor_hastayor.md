From out of the material that had been held in the vessel, and out of
which the fire-oblations have been offered,—‘*having made three bails*,’
turning bis face towards the South, he should ‘*offer them*’—*i.e*.,
throw them on the *kuśa-grass*, with reference to the Pitṛs.

The term ‘*piṇḍa*,’ ‘ball,’ stands for something *solid*; hence, one
should not, in this connection, offer disintegrated articles of food.

‘*In the manner of the water-libations*’—*i.e*., the manner of offering
water-libations, which has been just pointed out (in the preceding
verse).

In this connection, the following question arises:—“Should the
purificatory rites necessary for the sacrificial material be performed
over the substance taken out of the food that has been cooked for
feeding the Brāhmaṇas?—or, should separate rice be cooked?—and also what
should be the quantity of that sacrificial material? The rule laying
down ‘four handfulls’ cannot apply to this case.”

This question has been already discussed; in the absence of any specific
rules on the subject, one is free to do what one likes; and the quantity
should be just what may be necessary for the purpose in view.

Inasmuch as ‘the manner of the water-libations’ is laid down as
applicable to the offering of balls, it follows that this latter
offering is to be done with ‘hands in the *apasavya* position,’ and not
with silver implements.

‘*With collected mind*’—this has been added for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(215)
