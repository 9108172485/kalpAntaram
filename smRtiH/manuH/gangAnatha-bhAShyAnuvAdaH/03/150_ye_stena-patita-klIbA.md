‘*Thieves*’—stealers.

‘*Outcast*’—one who commits any one of the five ‘great sins.’

‘*Eunuch*’— emasculate, having the marks of both man and woman,
unvirile, impotent.

‘*Atheists*’—Materialists and others; those whose firm conviction is
that ‘gifts are nothing, oblations are nothing, there is no other world
the behaviour of those is unbelief; ‘those whose behaviour is like the
behaviour of atheists’ are called ‘having the behaviour of
atheists,’—this being an instance of the compound that drops its last
term. The word ‘atheist’ by itself would be sufficient; the term
‘behaviour’ has been introduced for the purpose of filling up the metre.

Or, the term ‘*nāstikavṛttayaḥ*’ may be taken to mean ‘those who derive
their livelihood from atheists.’

These Manu has declared to be undeserving of the offerings made at the
rites performed in honour of gods and Pitṛs.

The name of ‘Manu’ has been added for the purpose of lending force to
the prohibition; as, in reality, all duties have been described by
Manu.—(150)
