After having seated them, he should worship them *with perfumes and
garlands*: ‘*Perfumes*’—in the form of saffron, camphor, and such
things—he should offer them; and so also ‘*garlands*’—strings of
flowers. The eptihet ‘*sweet-smelling*’ qualifies ‘*garlands*;’ the
sense being that one should not offer flowers devoid of sweet smell. The
epithet is proper as qualifying ‘perfumes’ also, as there are
evil-smelling perfumes also, which have to be excluded.

Or, the term may stand for ‘*surabhi*’ *incense*, in which case, this
term would stand by itself.

Having first given these things to the Brāhmaṇas invited in honour of
the gods, he should give them to those invited in honour of the Pitṛs.

This rule, that these things shall be given first to those invited in
honour of the gods, is meant to imply that before the Brāhmaṇas have
commenced eating, things should be given to them in that order. When
once they have begun to eat, there can be no restriction regarding the
serving of the several vegetables, etc. This is the explanation that is
offered; as otherwise, why should this have been laid down over and over
again.

‘*Unreproached*’—blameless—‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’ This is a mere reiteration; as
it is only such Brāhmaṇas as have been specified for being invited. Or,
the use of the past-participal affix nifty be taken as prohibiting the
act denoted by the verbal root; the sense being—that ‘he should not
reproach, or find fault with them, after (they have been invited and
seated).’ People who favour this explanation argue that it is better to
abandon the denotation of the affix than give up that of the entire
word; and if it is taken as a mere reiteration, the whole word becomes
redundaut and meaningless.—(209)
