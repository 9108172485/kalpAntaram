The necessity of performing the ‘sacrifices’ every day is what is
enjoined here; the rest is all mere reiteration.

The meaning is that these sacrifices should be performed, even though in
an imperfect manner,—to the best of one’s ability; this also follows
from the compulsory character of the acts; hence the text has added the
phrase ‘*to the best of his capacity*;’—the ‘*tasi*’ affix being added
to the term ‘*śakti*,’ which is included in the ‘*ādyādī*’ group.

‘*Hāpayati*’—This has the sense of the simple root (‘*hā*,’ to
*abandon*), no significance being meant to be attached to the causal
affix. Or, the word may be etymologically explained as derived from the
nona ‘*hā*’ (*omission*)—formed by the root ‘*hā*’ with the ‘*kvip*’
affix; ‘*hāpayati*’ being explained as ‘*hām* *apayati*’ ‘brings about
omission;’ *āp* + *kvip*, and then the nominal root formed by the
addition of the affix ‘*nich*.’ The meaning, in any case, is ‘*omits
not*.’

Living in his own house—where the ‘slaughter-houses’ cannot be
avoided—he does not become tainted with the sin resulting from them.
This is said in praise of the sacrifices.—(71)
