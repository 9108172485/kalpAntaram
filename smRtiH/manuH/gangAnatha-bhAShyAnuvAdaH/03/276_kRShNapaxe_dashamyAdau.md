‘The term ‘*chira-rātra*’ means *long time*.

‘*That which serves for eternity*’ as well as that which brings about
long-standing satisfaction;—both these I am going to describe.

This is said for the purpose of attracting the attention of the
audience.

After ‘*kalpate*,’ the term ‘*prete*,’ ‘for the food,’ should be
supplied.—(266)
