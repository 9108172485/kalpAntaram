The further recommendation of the ‘*Brāhma*’ and other three forms for
the Brāhmaṇa, means that the ‘*Āsura*’ and the ‘*Gāndharva*’ are
prohibited for him.

Similarly, for the *Kṣatriya*, it is the ‘*Rākṣasa*’ alone, not the
‘*Āsura*’ and the ‘*Gāndharva*.’

For the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*, it is the ‘*Āsura*’ alone.

Among those that have been sanctioned (before) and prohibited now, there
is to be option; so that one may have recourse to the optional forms
only when those that have been sanctioned absolutely in all cases are
not possible. If a man were to have recourse to those forms of marriage
that have been sanctioned in one place and interdicted in another,
without considering the possibility or otherwise of those that are
absolutely sanctioned,—he would be committing a wrong, and his offspring
would be defective;—this is what the law-giver has indicated under verse
23 above by the phrase, ‘the good and bad effects upon the offspring.’
But such an act would not nullify the marriage itself in the way in
which the fact of the bride being the bridegroom’s ‘*sapiṇḍa*’
does.—(24)
