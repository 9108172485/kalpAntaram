The author states the result of the prohibitive injunction just put
forward.

‘*Paṅktya*’ means ‘those who are worthy of the line;—those who are not
so, are ‘*apaṅktya*;’ the ‘*yat*’ affix being added by virtue of the
term ‘*paṅkti*’ occurring in the ‘*daṇḍādi*’ group.

The results that accrue, from giving to such persons, to the giver,—all
that I am going to describe; do listen with attention.—(169)
