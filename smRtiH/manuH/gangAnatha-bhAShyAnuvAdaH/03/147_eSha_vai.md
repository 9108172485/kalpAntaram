Beginning with verse 122, twenty-five verses have gone before; and the
upshot of them all is as follows: (*a*) Śrāddhas should be performed on
the moon-less day;—(*b*) the person fed should be learned in the Veda,
highly educated, of right behaviour, belonging to a known family, the
sou of a person learned in the Veda and not bearing any relationship to
the person offering the *Śrāddha*. The rest of it all is only
commendatory.

‘*This*’—what has been just described,—is ‘*the the first*’— the
primary—‘*course*’—procedure at *Śrāddhas*; *viz*., that, the food shall
be presented to one who is not related to the performer.

‘*This*’—what is going to be described—‘should be regarded as ‘*the
secondary course*’—which is to be adopted only in the event of the
primary course being not possible This course is called ‘*anukalpa*,’
‘secondary course,’ by the ‘law of substitutes’ (propounded in
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra* 3.6.37 *et. seq*.).

‘*Always adopted*’— this is purely commendatory.—(147)
