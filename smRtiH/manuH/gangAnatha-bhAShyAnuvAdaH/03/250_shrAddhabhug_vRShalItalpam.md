They say that the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ in this verse stands for *woman*
generally; and in this sense they explain the etymology of the term to
mean—‘*vṛṣasyati’—chālayati*, ‘moves’—‘*bhartāram*.’ ‘her husband,’ Be
this woman a *Brāhmaṇī* or any other caste—all are prohibited. Says
another *Smṛti* (Gautama, 15.23)—‘On that day he shall remain firmly
continent.’

‘*Bed*’ denotes *sexual intercourse*; the prohibition does not apply to
merely *entering the bed*.

‘*Day*’ stands for day and night; hence the prohibition applies to the
night also.

‘*Ordure*’—this is a deprecatory exaggeration, intended to dissuade men.

‘*His ancestors*’—*i.e*., the ancestors of the man eating at the
*śrāddha*.

This also has to be explained as before; that is, the rule applies to
both (the feeder and the eater). As regards the eater, what is here laid
down is only ‘circumstantial;’ that is, it is enjoined as to be observed
by him only when the circumstance of eating at *śrāddhas* is present.
From the context, however, it is clear that it pertains to the Rite (and
hence to the Performer) also.—(250)
