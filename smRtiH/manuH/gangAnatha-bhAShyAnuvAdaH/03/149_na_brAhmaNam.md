This verse is not meant to be prohibitive o? the examination of
Brāhmaṇas (to be invited) at the rite performed in honour of the gods;
what is meant by it is the permitting, at certain times, of the feeding,
at rites in honour of gods, of such persons as are one-eyed, suffering
from elephantiasis, and so forth.

‘*At the rite in honour of the Pitṛs*’—*i,e*., when the time for
*Śrāddha* has arrived, one should do the examination with great care;
not so at the rite performed in honour of the gods. At the latter, one
may sometimes even feed those going to be mentioned. Who are those that
are permitted to be fed, we shall show later on.

According to others, however, this verse has been introduced for the
purpose of enjoining the strict exclusion of those going to be
mentioned; and not for that of permitting the feeding of those at the
rites in honour of gods.—(149)
