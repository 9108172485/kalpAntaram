‘*Being performed*;’—*i.e*., when a sacrifice, such as the Jyotiṣṭoma
and the like, has been commenced; if one gives away his daughter to the
‘*priest*’—the Adhvaryu—‘*who is officiating*’—working—‘*at it*;’—‘after
having *decked her*;’—this is a mere re-iteration; this forming an
essential condition in every form of giving one’s girl in marriage; that
‘one should give the girl in marriage after having decked her’ being a
general injunction.

“The cow, the house, the mule and other things have been mentioned as
the fee for priests, the giving of the daughter has not been found laid
down anywhere as helping in the fulfilment of sacrificial performances.”

What has ‘helping in the fulfilment of sacrificial performances’ got to
do with the subject under consideration? All that is meant is that, when
a sacrifice has begun to be performed, if one gives his daughter to the
priest, this constitutes the ‘*Daiva*’ form of marriage.

In this case, there is some slight return made by the bridegroom in the
form of services rendered in connection with the sacrifice. Even though
the daughter is not given in consideration of any sacrificial services
rendered, yet when she is given to him while he is engaged in a certain
act, it does give rise to the inference (that she has been given as a
reward for those services). And it is in view of this fact that the
‘*Daiva*’ form has been regarded as inferior to the ‘*Brāhma*’ form (in
which latter, there is not the slightest suspicion of any kind of
return).—(28).
