“*Pair*;”—*i.e*., the cow (female) and the bull (male).—‘*one or
two*,’—‘*after taking*’—receiving—‘*from the bridegroom*, ’—*when the
maiden is given away*’—this is the ‘*Ārṣa*’ form.

‘*In obedience to law*;’—*i.e*., with the idea that such receiving is
sanctioned by law, and hot with the idea of receiving it in exchange for
(price for) the girl. The sense is that what is received cannot be
regarded as the *price*; as there is no possibility of any higher or
lower demand being made (as there would be if it were a question of
*price*).—(29)
