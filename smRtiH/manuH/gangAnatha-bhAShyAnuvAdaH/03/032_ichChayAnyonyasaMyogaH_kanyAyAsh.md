The ‘*union*’—coming together at one place—‘*of the bride and
bridegroom, through love*’—through mutual longing.

In deprecation of this form of marriage it is added—‘*It has sexual
intercourse for its end*’—it serves the purpose of sexual intercourse
only. This is made clearer by the next clause—‘*it has its source* *in
lust*;’—‘*source*’ is that from which a thing springs; and it is from
lust that this union springs.—(32).
