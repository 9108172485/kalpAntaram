‘*Vaiśvadeva*,’ ‘*for the Viśvedevas*’—*i.e*., what is cooked for the
sake of the Viśvedevas. Though the term ‘*viśvedeva*’ literally means
‘all deities,’ yet here it is indicative of only those to whom oblations
are offered. Hence the term may be taken as standing also for what is
cooked for guests and others.

‘*Out of the food cooked, Homa should be offered to these deities*’— to
those going to be mentioned in the next verse. The term ‘*cooked*’
implies that the offering is made out of what has been already cooked
for all recipients, and that there is no special cooking for the deities
only, done with the *mantra ‘Devasya tvā savituḥ, etc*.’

‘*According to rule*’—this means that the Homa is to be offered in
accordance with rules laid down in the *Gṛhyasūtras*; by which all such
details of procedure become included as sweeping the spot, sprinkling
water over it, and so forth.

The term ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ is for the purpose of indicating the fact of the
three higher castes being entitled to the performance.

‘*Every day*’— daily.

‘*Deities*’ (in the Dative) serves to indicate the necessity of using
the syllable ‘*svāhā*,’ If the genitive bad been used, then the words
need (at the offering) would have been ‘*agneḥ idam*’ (not ‘*agnaye
svāhā*). The use of the term ‘*devatā*’ (‘Deity’), however, makes the
rule mean that ‘all offerings to the gods should be made with’ the
syllable *svāhā*.’ As for the syllable ‘*vaṣaṭ*,’ it is to be pronounced
at the end of the ‘*Yājyā*’ *mantras*, but never at a *Smārta Homa*;
while the syllable ‘*svāhā*’ is to be pronounced at all *Homas*; such
being the case, the formula used should be ‘*agnaye svāhā*.’—(84)
