“How can there be any *looking* by the blind man;—by virtue of which the
text says ‘*the* blind man *by looking*, etc.’?”

True; what is meant is only his proximity to the place. The meaning is
that, in an uncovered place, the blind man should be removed away from
such distance from which the man with eyes could see.

‘*The one-eyed man of sixty*;’—this does not mean that if the number is
more than these, they may be fed (even in the presence of the blind,
etc.). All that the reducing of the number means is that the delinquency
would be less serious, and hence the expiatory rite to be performed
would be on a smaller scale.

It is the *leper* that is called ‘*śvitrī*.’

‘*The man suffering from a foul disease*’—is well known,—(177)
