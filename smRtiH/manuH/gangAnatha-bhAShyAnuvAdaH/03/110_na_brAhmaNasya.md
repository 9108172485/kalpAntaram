Even though a *Kṣatriya*, during his travelling, happen to arrive at the
Brāhmaṇa’s house, at the time of breakfast,—he is not a “guest.” Hence
it is not incumbent upon the Brāhmaṇa to offer food to him.

Similarly with the *Vaiśya* and the *Śūdra*.

The ‘*friend*’ and the ‘*relation*’ are one’s *equals*, not *guests*.

The ‘*Teacher*’ has to be served as the master; as described in the
text—‘the act of cooking should be done after having offered to the
Teacher’ (*Gautama* 5-26).—(110).
