‘*Of these*’— of the Hearth and the other ‘slaughter-houses.’

‘*For the purpose of expiating*’—*i.e*., for the purpose of removing the
evils proceeding from them.

‘Course’—The ‘course’ meant are—*smearing* of the Hearth, *scraping* of
the grinding-stone, and so forth.

‘*Have been ordained by the great sages*;’—have been declared as to be
performed;—‘*the live great sacrifices*,’ ‘*for householders*’—*i.e*.,
for persons who have entered the householder’s state—the term
‘*grhamedha*’ stands for the Householder’s state.

‘*Daily*’—as no particular period has been specified, we gather that
they are to be performed throughout life; and it is thus that their
compulsory character becomes estsblished.

‘*Great sacrifices*’—this is the name of the rites to be performed.—(69)
