Among the said ten days, the ‘even days’ are the sixth, the eighth, the
tenth, the twelfth, the fourteenth and the sixteenth; and when one has
intercourse with one’s wife on these days, sons are born to him.

‘*One who desires a son should have recourse to one’s wife on the even
days of her season*;’—*i.e*., because ‘*female ones*’—*i.e*., daughters
are conceived—‘on the uneven days,’—‘*therefore*’ for the bringing about
of the birth of sons, ‘*one should have recourse* to’—have sexual
intercourse with—‘*one’s wife, on the even days of her season?*’

This is a mere reiteration; and it is also a restrictive rule, the
meaning being that ‘one, for whom no sons have been born, should not
have intercourse with one’s wife on the uneven days.’—(48)
