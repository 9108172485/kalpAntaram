‘*Śūdrāvedi*’ is one who acquires—*i.e*., marries—a *Śūdra* girl.

‘*Becomes an outcasts*’—*i.e*., as good as an outcaste.

Such is the opinion of Atri, and of Utathya’s son. The authorities have
been mentioned with a view to inspire respect.

The first half of the verse is supplementary to the prohibition
contained in the preceding verse.

‘*According to Śaunaka*, *by the birth of a child*.’ This is an entirely
different rule. It presumes that marriage with a Śūdra girl is
permitted, and then prohibits intercourse with her during her ‘courses’;
‘birth of a son’ is possible only by having intercourse on the even days
of the woman’s period. Thus the meaning is that ‘one should not have
intercourse with his Śūdra wife during her courses.’

‘*According to Bhṛgu, by having children from her*.’ This also is a
distinct rule by itself. ‘*Tadapalya*’ is one who has only such children
as. are born of his *Śūdra* wife; and the character of such a man is
called ‘*tadapatyatā*.’ This is the opinion of *Bhṛgu*; which means that
‘after one has begotten children from wives of the more respectable
castes, he may have intercourse with the Śūdra wife.’

The mention of ‘outcaste’ here is only meant to indicate degradation; it
does not mean that the man is to be actually treated as an ‘outcaste,’
as described under 11.182. All this we shall explain later on.—(16).
