Some people make the offering *after* the Brāhmaṇas have been fed.

‘*They cause them to be eaten by birds*.’—This mode of disposal is in
addition to those mentioned above.

‘*Fire*—this is only a reiteration of what has been said above.

This offering of balls, after the feeding of Brāhmaṇas, is meant to be
done near the place where the leavings of the dinner lie.—(261)
