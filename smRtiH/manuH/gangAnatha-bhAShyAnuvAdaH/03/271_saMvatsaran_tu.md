As between direct and indirect connection, the former being more
authoritative, we construe ‘*gavyena’—‘cow’s*’—with ‘*payasā*,’ ‘milk
and not with ‘*māṃsa*,’ ‘meat,’ which forms the subject-matter of the
context.

Others, however, explain the particle ‘*ca*’ as having a cumulative
force, and then explain the passage to mean, ‘meat of the cow, and milk
or milk-rice.’

‘*Pāyasa*,’ ‘*milk-preparations*,’ stands for curds and such things, as
also rice cooked in milk.

‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—is *old goat*. The scriptures describe it as follows
s—‘Drinking with three, devoid of sense-virility and white,—such a goat
has been called *Vārdhriṇasa* by persons learned in sacrifices, in
connection with sacrificial rituals.’ That goat is called ‘drinking with
three’ who wets his tongue and two ears, while drinking water.

The Expiatory Rite that Śaṅkha has prescribed in connection with the
eating of beef, should be understood to apply to eating apart from the
‘*Madhuparka*’ offering and from the ‘*Aṣṭakā’ Śrāddhas*.—(271)
