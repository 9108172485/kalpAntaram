This verse prohibits the receiving ‘of consideration’ in connection with
the ‘Āsura’ form of marriage; that this is so, is indicated by the fact
that later on (in 54) the acceptance of a dowry for the bride is
permitted.

‘*Wise*’—*i.e*., knowing the impropriety of accepting the gift.

The girl’s father shall not accept even a small present; by accepting
it, he becomes tainted with the sin of child-selling.

“What is it that is called ‘*Śulka*,’ ‘consideration?’”

It is what is received from the bridegroom on stipulation. When there is
a bargaining, carried on in consideration of the good or bad qualities
of the bride,—it is a case of pure ‘selling;’ what is referred to here
is the acceptance of even a small present—though the bride is possessed
of most excellent qualities,—that also without any stipulation.

This (acceptance of unequal price) is not a condition of ‘sale’ proper;
the act is only deprecated by being described as being of the nature of
‘selling.’—(51)
