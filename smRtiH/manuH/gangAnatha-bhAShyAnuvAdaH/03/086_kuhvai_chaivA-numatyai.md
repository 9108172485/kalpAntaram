‘*To Dyauḥ-Pṛthivī jointly*’—with the formula ‘*dyāvā-pṛthivībhyām
svāhā*.’

‘*Finally to Sviṣṭakṛt*’—‘*Sviṣṭakṛt*’ (accomplisher of what is
extremely desirable) is an adjective, the deity qualified by it being
Agni. That this is so is indicated by the assertion in another *Smṛti*
to the effect that ‘this offering is to be made *to Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt*.’
This offering to *Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt* has been prescribed in the Veda as to
be made in the case of all *Homas*.

‘*Finally*’— though this is already implied by the order in which the
names have been mentioned, yet it has been reiterated (by means of the
term ‘finally’) for the purpose of indicating that when, according to
another *Smṛti*, a large number of oblations are offered conjointly
under this head, that to ‘*Agni-Sviṣṭakṛt*’ should come first.

“All these oblations forming a single act of *Homa*, the several deities
mentioned should be treated as optional alternatives.”

But whence does- it follow that there is a single Homa? Verse 85, which
speaks of oblations ‘to Agni and to Soma, etc.,’ is the originative
Injunction of the Homas; and hence the *Homa* -offerings being severally
qualified by the mention of several special deities, the Homas are
clearly recognised as distinct.—(86)
