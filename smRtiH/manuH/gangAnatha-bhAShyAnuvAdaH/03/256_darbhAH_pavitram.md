The preceding verse has described the disposal of the remnant in the
dishes; the present verse mentions the fact that the remnant fallen on
the ground is for servants.

‘*Ajihma*’ means ‘*not dishonest*,’ ‘straightforward.’

‘*Aśaṭha*’ is ‘not idle,’ ‘dutiful.’

Of such servants the said remnant is the share.

For this reason, large quantities of food shall be served, so that, when
the invited person is eating, something may fall on the ground.—(246)
