Other persons also, happening to be present on the occasion, should
offer words of encouragement; and the terms to be used are here
mentioned.

Another commentator explains as follows:—The permission to take food
should be sought by means of these terms; hence these words have got to
be uttered by the performer of the *Śrāddha*. But he should say,
‘*Svadadhvam*,’ ‘please eat well,’ and not ‘*Svaditam*,’ ‘well eaten;’
or, the reading may be ‘*Svadatu*’ (‘do eat please’).

This explanation is based upon another *Smṛti* and upon custom; and,
according to this, when the Brāhmaṇas have begun to eat, they should be
enlivened by the performer of the *Śrāddha* with these words.

‘*At the goṣṭha*’—*i.e*., when several cows are sitting at the same
place;—the word to be pronounced is ‘*Suśṛtam*,’ ‘well-cooked.’

The word ‘*Astu*,’ ‘may it be,’ is understood everywhere.

At the rite in honour of the gods, the term used should be ‘*rucitam*’
or ‘*rocitam*—(254)
