‘*Pāṅktya*’ are those that deserve the *paṅkti, line*. One is called
‘*pāṅktya*’ when one is deserving of sitting on the same seat as, and
eating in the company of, good men. He who is not so deserving, is
‘*a-pāṅktya*.’

As many worthy people—learned men, ascetics and persons learned in the
Veda—the unworthy man happens to look upon while the former are
eating,—the reward of feeding so many men,—in the shape of the
satisfaction of his ancestors—fails to be accomplished.

For this reason, when one is performing *śrāddhas*, one should send away
from that place all thieves and others.

‘*Foolish*’—ignorant.—(176)
