What is done in fire, in the form of pouring the libation, with the
words, ‘*agnaye svadhā namaḥ*’ (‘this is an offering for Agni,’) should
be done in the ‘*apasavya*’ form.

Some people explain the term ‘*apasavya*’ to mean that the act should be
done with the right hand, not with the left, nor by both; in view of the
prohibition contained in verse 225 below. This, according to these
people, has been added, in view of it being thought possible to do the
act with both hands.

This, however, is not right. Because the ‘*apasavya form*’ here enjoined
is in reference to the ‘serial performance’ of those libations that are
poured into Fire; hence, what is meant is that the libations should be
poured in such a manner that they tend *towards the South, not towards
the North*;—this latter being what is right in the case of offerings to
the gods. That is to say, when the sacrificial material is being poured
with the ladle, one should be facing the South, and not the North—this
rule standing on the same footing as that which prescribes the pouring
of water-libations to the Pitṛs in such a manner that it flows between
the thumb and the index-finger.

The epithet ‘*entire*’ indicates that all such acts as the placing of
the material in the dish, and so forth, should be done in the
‘*apasavya*’ form.

‘*He should offer water with the hand in the apasavya position*,’

‘*Śanaiḥ*’ (for ‘*bhuvi*’) is another reading.

The purpose of this rule is that it has been emphasised with a view to
preclude the use of silver implements (according to 202).

‘*Āvṛt*’ stands for ‘*Āvṛtti*,’ ‘repetition.’—(214)
