The particle ‘*sam*’ (in ‘*Sambhojanī*) connotes *convivility*; and the
term ‘*sambhojanī*’ means that at which men dine together; such
convivial dinner is possible only among friends. Or, the word
‘*sambhojamī*’ may be taken as standing for a social dinner of several
people.

The making of friendships by Śrāddhas is a custom with ‘devils,’—the
term ‘devil’ here standing for highway robbers.

This gift ‘*remains in this world alone*’—*i.e*., it is not capable of
bringing rewards in the other world; just as the blind cow, which
remains tied in a single room, so this gift also remains in this world
only,—*i.e*., the only result it brings about is the goodwill of
friends,—and it does not bring any benefit to the ancestors.

The term ‘*dakṣiṇā*’ here stands for *gift*.—(141)
