With both hands he should himself take up ‘*the supply of
food*,’—*i.e*., the dish supplied with food,—from the kitchen-house, to
the place where the Brāhmaṇas are being fed, and—‘*place it near the
Brāhmaṇas*.’

Others explain the verse as follows:—The term ‘*vardhitam*,’ ‘*supply*,’
stands for the *massed food*; this he should place before the Brāhmaṇas,
‘thinking of his *Pitṛs*’—*i.e*., in his mind saying, ‘this is for
you’—he should scatter the food.

This is not right. Later on (228), our author is going to declare that
‘having brought up the food, he should serve it all;’ hence the
‘*placing*’ mentioned in the present verse must simply mean the bringing
of the food from another place and depositing it near the
Brāhmaṇas.—(224)
