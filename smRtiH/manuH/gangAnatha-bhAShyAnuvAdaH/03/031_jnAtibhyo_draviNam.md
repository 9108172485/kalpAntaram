‘*Kinsmen*.’—the father and other relations of the bride.

‘*As* *well as to the bride*;’—*i.e*., by way of ‘dowry.’

The compound ‘*Kanyāpradāna*’ is to be expounded as ‘*Kanyāyāḥ
āpradānam*’—the meaning being ‘the carrying away of the maiden.’ This
constitutes the ‘*Āsura*’ form of marriage.

*Of his own will*;—*i.e*., in any manner he may chose; not according to
rules laid down in the scriptures. This is what distinguishes this from
the ‘*Ārṣa*’ form. In the latter, the scripture restricts the gift to ‘a
cow and a bull’ only; while in the present case, the ‘*wish*’ of the
giver shall depend upon the beauty, the character and such other
qualities of the bride.—(31).
