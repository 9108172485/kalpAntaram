‘*Avakāśa*,’ is *place, spot*.

‘*Cokṣa*’—naturally clean and tending to mental calm; such as forests,
etc.

‘*Water-banks*’— sand-banks, near rivers.

‘*Secluded places*’—uncrowded sacred places.

This verse contains a totally different injunction. Hence, in the case
of such places, the rule regarding *smearing with cowdung* does not
apply; because the rule (in the preceding verse) distinctly says that
‘one should make it so;’ which means that the rule applies to a place
where *cleanness* has to be brought about. In regard to places that are
naturally clean, their fitness is secured by ‘being examined and
sprinkled with water.’

By the Śrāddha ‘*offered*’— performed—in such places, the Pitṛs become
greatly pleased.—(207)
