It has been said above that the alms is to be given ‘in the proper
form;’ and this form is now described.

The mention of the ‘water-pot,’ which has not been referred to in this
context before, is meant to indicate that in all cases one need not
always give *alms* only.

‘*Having honoured*,’—after having worshipped.

‘*Vidhipūrvakam*,’—‘*in accordance with scriptural injun*
*ctions*’—means ‘that which has scriptural injunctions for its
precedent;’ the term ‘precedent’ meaning *reason*; the compound
therefore means that what is here stated is on the basis of scriptural
injunctions.

Or, the term ‘*vidhi*’ may stand for *method*; the sense being that the
right, method should be adopted first; the method being that ‘he should
be honoured,’ as already mentioned.

‘*The true meaning of the Veda*’—the real, the undoubted, sense of the
Veda; he who knows this meaning—to such a Brāhmaṇa one should ‘make
over’ the things.

The term ‘*to the Brāhmaṇa*’ restricts the gift to the particular caste;
and the term ‘*knowing*, &c.’ restricts it to persons possessing a
certain qualification.

Hence, in connection with the act of giving, three things are enjoined
here—

1.  ‘whatever is to be given should be given to the Brāhmaṇa,’
2.  ‘to a Brāhmaṇa who knows the meaning of the Veda,’
3.  and ‘only after having honoured him,’

And this multiplicity of injunctions (in a single verse) (though
inadmissible in a Vedic text) may be admissible in the work of a human
author.

The next, verse proceeds to point out the danger in connection with the
act of ‘giving’ enjoined above.—(96).
