It is now described what is to be done in the Fire.

The Genitive in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative;

Agni is one deity, and Soma-Yama conjointly form one conjunct deity;
just like Agni-Soma.

Of these two deities, ‘*having brought about at first, the
satisfaction*, *by the offering of sacrificial food, he should
afterwards satisfy the Pitṛs*.’ That is, he should offer balls of food
and feed the Brāhmaṇas.

In the *Gṛhyasūtra*, other deities have been prescribed; so that the
deities mentioned in the present text are for those who have no
*Gṛhyasūtra* of their own.

‘*Satisfaction*’ *stands* for *sustenance*. That gods are sustained by
sacrificial food, is a laudatory exaggertion.—(211).
