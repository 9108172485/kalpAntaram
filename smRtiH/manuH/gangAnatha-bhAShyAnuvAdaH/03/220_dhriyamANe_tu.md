When the Brāhmaṇas have been smeared with perfumes, adorned with
garlands and have smelt the incense, the water-offering should be
presented; and, along with this, also sesamum along with
*Kuśa-blade*;—the term ‘*pavitra*’ being used in the sense of *Kuśa
grass*.

‘*Having presented*,’— offered—water to the Brāhmaṇas, and being
permitted by them, one should offer libations into fire. The
construction is—‘*brāhmaṇaiḥ anujñātaḥ kuryāt*.’

‘*Collectively*’—*i.e*., all the Brāhmaṇas should give the permission
together.

This necessity of obtaining permission implies also the use of some
words to be addressed in seeking the permission; they could not grant
the permission without being asked for it. From this it follows that the
words to be used should be such as—‘May I make the offering into fire,’
‘I shall make it,’ and so forth. The use of words for according the
permission is also hereby implied. All this should be done by means of
correct forms, of words; this has been shown by the authors of
*Gṛhyasūtras*—‘He should seek their permission with such words as, *May
I make the offering into fire*—*may I do it*; and they should say, *Yes
do it*.’— (210).
