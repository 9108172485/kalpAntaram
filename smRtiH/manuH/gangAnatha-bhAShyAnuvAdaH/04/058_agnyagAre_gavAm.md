The term ‘*goṣṭha*,’ ‘*pen*’ signifies the dwelling-place; and it is a
different word from the compound \[ *go* + *sthā*, which means an *abode
of cows*, and with which, therefore, the word ‘*gavām*,’ ‘*of cows*,’
would be superfluous\].

‘*Brāhmaṇas*.’—Significance is meant to be attached to the plural
number. \[What is prescribed is to be done only when there are many
Brāhmaṇas present\].

‘*Hand*’ stands for the *arm*.

‘*Eating*.’—When he himself is eating.—(58).
