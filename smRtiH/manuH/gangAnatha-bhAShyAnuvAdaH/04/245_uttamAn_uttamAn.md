‘*Having recourse to superior people*;’—*i.e*., forming connections with
them,—‘*the Brāhmaṇa attains eminence*.’ The term, ‘*brāhmaṇa*,’
standing for the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also.

‘*By the contrary procedure*,’—by adopting the opposite process—*i.e*.,
by forming connections with inferior people—the man becomes a *Śūdra*.
Since it is not possible for the caste of a man to disappear, what is
meant is that he becomes *equal to the Śūdra*.—(245)
