‘*Oven*’—a structure of bricks, for the depositing of fire.
‘*Mountain*’—here stands for forests and gardens; as the mountain-top is
going to be specifically forbidden (in the next verse). If the word were
really meant to stand for the mountain itself, and the prohibition
applied to the mountain as a whole, then people living on the mountains
would have to go without passing urine at all.

‘*Ant-hill*’—the mound of earth set up by insects.—(46)
