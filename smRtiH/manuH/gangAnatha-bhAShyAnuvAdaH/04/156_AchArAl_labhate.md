It is not meant that the child is made equipped with learning and other
good qualities; in fact, such qualities are considered desirable in
children. Says an old text—‘What is to be done with the cow that does
not give milk nor bear calf; what is the use of a son being born who is
neither learned nor righteous?’

‘*Inexhaustible*—vast; which cannot become exhausted, even through
vices.

‘*Everything inauspicious*;’—such marks as a black spot on the shoulder,
and the like, which are indications of poverty, misfortune, etc. This
also is destroyed by Right Conduct.

Thus all that is unrighteous and evil is destroyed, if a man sticks to
Right Conduct.—(156)
