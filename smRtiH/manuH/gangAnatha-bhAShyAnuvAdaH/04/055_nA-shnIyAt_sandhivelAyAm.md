‘*Junction-time*’—twilight.

‘*Saṃveśana*’—is *sleeping*.

Vedic Study also during twilight is going to be forbidden later on.
Another Smṛti has forbidden intercourse with women also, during
twilight, *e.g*.—‘At the time of twilight, one shall avoid four
acts—eating, sexual intercourse, sleeping and reading.’

‘*He shall not scratch the ground*.’—What is forbidden is the tearing of
the ground, and not the writing of letters, &c., with a writing-brush
and such things.

‘*He shall not remove his own garland*.’—Flowers stringed together are
called ‘garland;’ and when one has placed this upon his head, or on his
neck, he himself should not remove it,—either because it has faded or
because it is found to be too burdensome. What is meant is that he shall
have it removed by another person.

Some people assert that the whole of the verse pertains to the time of
twilight.—(55).
