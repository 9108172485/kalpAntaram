‘*The man*’—*i.e*., he who does the despising.

‘*These three, when despised*.’—The Kṣatriya and the. snake destroy a
man with their visible (physical) power, while the *Brāhmaṇa* does it by
means of incantations and oblations, as also by means of the spiritual
wrong involved in his ill-treatment.

‘*Therefore these three* &c.’—This sums up the whole thing. Having
indicated the evil involved, the Author has added this summing up, with
a view to show that what is here mentioned is to be avoided with special
care; and from the great care thus enjoined it follows that the act here
prohibited involves a correspondingly serious Expiatory Rite also.—(136)
