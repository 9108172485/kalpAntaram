For three ‘*muhūrtas*’ after rising, the sun is called the ‘young sun,’

‘*Smoke from the dead body*’—that which rises from a dead body being
burnt.

‘*Broken seat*’—*i.e*., that which is torn, or with holes, or injured.
All this should be avoided.

‘*He* *shall not cut his nails and hair*’—himself; when they have grown
too long, he should get them cut by the barber.

He should not tear his nails—even though they may have become very
long—with his teeth.

Others construe as follows:—‘He shall not cut bis nails and hair with
his teeth,—aud the nails he shall not cut even with his teeth.’

Young women often tear their nails, in the process of adorning,
them.—(69)
