What is forbidden here is the hair-catching, etc., done in anger; for
there is ‘hair-catching’ also during sexual intercourse, and this is not

The compound ‘*śiraḥ-snāta*’ is to be expounded as^(‘)*śiraḥ snātam

accordance with the rule governing such compounds as, by appearance,
belong to the ‘*Rājadanta*’ group (Pāṇini 2.2.31).

‘*He shall not touch any limb*’—of his own.—(83)
