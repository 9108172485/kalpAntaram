When, either in ordinary conversation or in literary discussions, one
talks with passion and lays a wager, and so forth, always trying to show
himself off,—this is what is called ‘*wrangling conversation*.’

‘*Garland outside*;’—*i.e*., if the garland happen to be above the
clothing, it should be hidden with a piece of cloth. Such is the custom
also.

Others have explained ‘outside’ to mean an open public place. The sense
of the text in that case would be that one should not wander about in
public places, as the road, &c., with a garland too obtrusively worn.

Or, ‘*bahirmālya*’ may mean that whose fragrance has gone out; *i.e*.,
whose odour is not felt. Says another Smṛti text—‘One should not wear an
odourless garland, except that made of gold.’

‘*Riding on the back of cows*’— What is forbidden is riding on the bare
back, without a saddle.—‘*Altogether*.’ When a saddle has been put on,
or the animal has been harnessed to the cart, &c., then it would not be
‘riding on the back;’ and hence these are not forbidden.—(72)
