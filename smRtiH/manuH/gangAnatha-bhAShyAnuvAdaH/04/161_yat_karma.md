The ‘soul’s satisfaction’, already mentioned before, is mentioned again
for recalling it to the mind; and its exact scope has already been
explained.

While an act is being performed, if there arises in the mind no sort of
doubt or hesitation, then that act should he proceeded with. But, if the
mind is not satisfied in regard to an action, that action should be
avoided.—(161)
