The sacrifices prescribed in Discourse IV are reiterated here for the
purpose of laying down details in connection with them; these details
shall be described in the next verse.

Others think that the reiteration of these sacrifices under the
‘observances’ is for the purpose of establishing their obligatory
character; so that the man shall form the determination that ‘so long as
I continue to be a householder, I shall not omit the Five Great
Sacrifices.’

In any case, we should not entertain the idea that these have been
mentioned twice for the purpose of enjoining them twice over. Because,
in the present verse, we do not find any injunctive word; all that is
said is that ‘he shall not omit;’ and, as a matter of fact, this
‘non-omission’ is already implied by the obligatory character of the
sacrifices. And since we recognise in these sacrifices the same that
have been enjoined, before, there is no reason why they should be
regarded as distinct acts.

‘*To the beet of his power*’—*i.e*., with cooked food, or with uncooked
food, or with fruits and roots.—(21)
