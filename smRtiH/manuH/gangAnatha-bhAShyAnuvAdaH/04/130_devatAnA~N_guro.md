‘*Gods*’ here stands for *Images*; as these alone can cast shadows.

‘*Superior*’—*i.e*., his father.

‘*Preceptor*’—one who has performed for him the Initiatory Ceremony.

These two have been mentioned separately, with a view to show that this
additional respect is to be shown to the two persons concerned, not
simply because they are to be treated as ‘superiors,’ \[but because they
are, by their distinctive character, entitled to this additional form of
respect\].

Hence, what is here prescribed does not apply to the maternal uncle and
such other persons.

Some people assert that “such a view would be contrary to usage; hence
the separate mention of the two (‘superior’ and ‘preceptor’) has to be
explained as anologous to such expressions as ‘(*gobalīvarda*,’ ‘bovine
bull’ (where the tautology indicates some sort of distinctive
superiority).

‘*Tawny*’ is the reddish brown colour; it stands here for a substance
possessed of that colour; in the present context it stands for either
the *tawny cow* or the *Soma-creeper*; the term ‘*babhru*’ (‘tawny’)
being found in the Veda to be applied to both these things.

‘*intentionally*.’—This means that if it is done unintentionally, there
is no wrong done.—(130)
