‘*That which is not offered to his own ancestor*;’—*i.e*., that at which
uncooked food is offered;—while of such a rite the ‘*odour and stain
remain*,’ so long he is unfit for study. This is a rule different from
the forgoing rule. When on the next day, the man has bathed, and the
odour has disappeared, he becomes fit for study.

What is said here is only by way of an iṇḍicatipn. Even while the ‘odour
and stain’ are not actually there, the man shall hot study, until the
food eaten has become digested.

The epithet ‘*learned*’ reiterates the rule that it is only the learned
Brāhmaṇa that is entitled to eat at funeral rites.—(111).
