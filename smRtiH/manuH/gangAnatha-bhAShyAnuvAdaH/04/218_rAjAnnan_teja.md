The Text now proceeds to describe the effects of transgressing the above
prohibitions.

One who eats the king’s food loses his vigour; and so with all the rest.

The terms ‘goldsmith’ and the rest, are denotative of particular
*professions*; so that those persons who deal in making articles of gold
are called goldsmiths. Similarly, with ‘dyer’ and other terms. Those who
cut leather are called ‘leather-cutters,’ this name being applied to
those who live by this trade.

In the present context, there are some whose food has not been forbidden
in the foregoing verses; but the evil results flowing therefrom are now
described; the prohibition of these is to be inferred from the
latter.—(218)
