If one uses the conveyance, etc., that belong to another person, and
have not been given, one comes to partake of the fourth part of the sins
of that person.

Some persons assert in this connection that, since the text uses the
terra ‘*when these hive not been given*,’ what is meant is that one
should not use these things when they have been assigned for public use.

This is not right; because the prohibition herein contained refers to
*what belongs to another person*; and what 1 ms been assigned for public
use does not *belong to another person*; since he has already renounced
his proprietory right over them, in the proper manner.

The specification of the ‘*fourth part*’ is not meant to be emphasized;
as has been already explained before.—(202)
