‘*Without cause*’—*i.e*., except when called upon to scratch them.

‘*His cavities*’—the eye, &c.,—he shall not touch.

‘*Secret*’—situated in the arm-pits and over the generative organs.

‘*He shall avoid*’—*i.e*., the *touching* mentioned before. A new verb
has been used for the purpose of filling up the metre. Others say that
the new verb shows that what is prohibited is the *looking at* the
hairs.—(144)
