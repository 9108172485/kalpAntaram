The striking of all persons having been equally forbidden, the next five
verses are meant to show the greater heinousness of striking the
Brāhmaṇa.

‘*Threatens*’—by raising the stick—‘*with the intention of

‘*For a hundred years he wanders about in hell*,’ *i.e*., continues to
suiter the evil effects of that act.—(165).
