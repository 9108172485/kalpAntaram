‘*Calamity*’—supernatural troubles arising from natural portents,—such
as sickness, loss of wealth, separation from loved ones, and so forth.
All this is precluded from people who observe the auspicious customs.

This indicates the obligatory character of the acts, even though they
are done with a view to a definite end. No one ever actually seeks for
the cessation of supernatural troubles; hence, the term ‘*ever*’ is
purely reiterative; the meaning being that, even though there may be
some persons who may not seek it, yet the rule is entirely obligatory.
So that, by doing the act, the man fulfils two ends—he fulfils an
obligatory duty and also avoids calamity.—(146)
