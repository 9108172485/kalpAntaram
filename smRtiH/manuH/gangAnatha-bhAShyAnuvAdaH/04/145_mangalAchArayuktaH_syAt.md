‘*Auspiciousness*’ consists in the accomplishment of such desirable
things as long life, wealth, and so forth;—the ‘*custom*’ is conducive
to this—such as the wearing of the *gorocanā* -mark on the forehead, the
touching of good fruit, and s o forth;—on such custom he shall be
‘*intent*’; *i.e*., he shall always follow such customs.

“The authority of *customs* has already been asserted before.”

True. But what is asserted here is custom pertaining to non-physical
ends. If those acts were done with a view to visible results, then it
would so happen that the acts would sometimes fail to bring about the
desired result, and this would lead the man to neglect them. It is for
this purpose that the thing is reiterated here. Just as in connection
with the time of starting on a journey, we shall have the reiteration of
such acts as the saluting of cows and other similar things, looking at
white garments, the singing of *kapiñjala-* birds to the right, the
crowing of the crow to the right on a fruit-laden tree. All these acts
shall be done for the sake of one’s welfare; and acts contrary to these
shall be avoided.

‘*With senses subjugated*’—without hankering for the objects of sense.
Though this has been often repeated, us being something desirable for
man, yet it is mentioned here with a view to save the man from falling
into sin.

Since oblation may be offered elsewhere also, the text has specially
mentioned the ‘fire.’

‘*Untired*.’—This only reiterates what has been said before.—(145)
