The author now mentions the “occupations” by name; and their mere names
imply the excellence of some of them; and from this it follows that one
should have recourse to the deprecated ones only when the commended ones
are not possible.

Of these, the “Death” and the “Super-Death” are the most deprecated; and
worse than these is the “Truth and Falsehood,” as is clear from the fact
that the Text says that one may live ‘*even* by these;’ where the term
‘*even*’ clearly indicates undesirability.—(4)
