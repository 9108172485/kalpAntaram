Though the text uses the general term ‘sense-organs,’ yet what are meant
are the eyes and the other organs located in the head. The term
‘*prāṇa*’ is found to be used in the sense of *sense-organs* in the
Veda, where, in the *Upaniṣads*, the origin of sense-organs has been
described.

‘*Limbs*’—ankles, knees, feet, and so forth.

‘*With the palm*’ he shall take up water and then touch the organs
&c.—(143)
