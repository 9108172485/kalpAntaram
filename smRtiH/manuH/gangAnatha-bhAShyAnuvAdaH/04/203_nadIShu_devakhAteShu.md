As a matter of fact, all *rivers* are ‘dug by the gods;’ hence they
cannot be both, which would necessitate the differentiation connoted by
the epithet; hence the gender of the epithet should be that of the
things qualified by it. As for *tanks*, etc., these are ‘dug by gods’ as
well as ‘dug by men. (Hence, in their case, the differentiation is
necessary). As a matter of fact, these are never actually *dug by the
gods*; all. that is meant to be indicated by the epithet, therefore, is
their *largeness* and *importance*, due to the fact that people do not
remember who dug them.—(203)
