‘*Clinging pursuits*’ are those to which people become addicted; just as
singing and music; to these passionate persons *cling*, as it were.
Hence one shall not ‘seek’ —*i.e*., earn wealth by means of singing and
music.

‘*Contrary act*’—*i.e*., that which is forbidden by the scriptures, or
iś not in accordance with the usages of one’s family.

‘*Nor when wealth*’—enough for subsistence—‘*is already there*’—having
been inherited from father and others;—one shall not seek for more,

‘*Even in times of distress, not from here and there*.’—As a rule, one
should subsist on presents received from proper persons; but, in rare
cases, the scripture shall permit a contrary course also, in times of
distress.—(15)
