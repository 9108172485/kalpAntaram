For fear of hell, the ‘*illiterate*’—ignorant—‘*person*’ *should fight
shy of accepting a gift*;’—*i.e*., for fear of being destroyed, he
should not accept any gifts to say nothing of *gold* and other specified
things.

By accepting even ‘*a small gift*,’ in the shape of things of little
value as lead and the like, the illiterate man sinks in the same manner
as the cow sinks in a morass.—(191).
