‘*Tiraskṛtya*’—‘placing between’—the stick, etc.; on that he shall pass
urine. Or, ‘*tiraskṛtya*’ may mean ‘having covered;’ in which case, the
meaning would be that ‘he should cover the ground with sticks and then
pass urine.’ In this latter case, the reading with the
lnsturmental-ending—‘*tṛṇādinā*—would be clearer; the construction
being—‘having covered with sticks or with clods, or with leaves, or with
grass.’

‘*Pass it*’—i.e., pass urine and evacuate his bowels.

‘*Restraining his speech*, *clean*’—*i.e*., with mouth not unwashed (not
having anything in his mouth).

‘*Body wrapped*’—covered with cloth.

‘*Covered*’—the head tied up. The rule prescribed is—‘with the sacred
thread on his ear, etc.’—(50).
