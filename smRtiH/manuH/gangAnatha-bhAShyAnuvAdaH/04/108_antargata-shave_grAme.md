In a village where a corpse still lies,—*i.e*., while the corpse has not
been taken away.

‘*Low people*.’— This term does not stand here for the *Śūdra*; as the
‘proximity of the Śūdra’ has been already forbidden under 4.99. It
denotes *unrighteousness*, and stands for such people as are similar to
Śūdra, in their unrighteousness. Hence there is prohibition of study
even in the presence of such people as are unrighteous in their conduct.

‘*During weeping*,’—where the Sound of weeping is heard; the participial
term ‘*rudyamāne*’ being used as a noun.

‘*In a crowd of people*.’— One shall not study in a place where a large
number of men have congregated on some business.

Or, the meaning may be—‘*where a crowd of people are weeping*;’ the
prohibition applying to a place where a large number of men are weeping.

The *ātmanepada* participial affix in ‘*rudyamāne*,’ in the Active
sense, is a Vedic anomaly.—(108)
