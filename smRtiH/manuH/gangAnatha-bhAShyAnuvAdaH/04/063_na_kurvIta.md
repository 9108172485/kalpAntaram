‘*Exertion without a purpose*’—*i.e*., that which does not bring any
benefit, preceptible or imperceptible; *e.g*., hankering after news of
other countries, and so forth.

‘*Añjali*’ is *joined palms*;—with this ‘*he shall not drink water*.’
Since water is mentioned by name, the prohibition does not apply to milk
and other liquids.

‘*Articles of food in his lap*’—fried grains and cakes, &c., he shall
not eat, while they are on his thighs. The term ‘*articles of food’
extends* the prohibition to fruits also. As for rice, the mixture of
fried Hour with water and such other semi-liquid things as cannot be
eaten without mixing water,—there is no possibility of their being eaten
on the lap.

‘*Curiosity*’—is over-eagerness for information about things, without
any purpose.

‘*Na jātu*’—never.—(63).
