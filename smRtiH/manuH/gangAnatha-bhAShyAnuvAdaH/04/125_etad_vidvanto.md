‘*Knowing this*’,—*i*. *e*., the connection of the Vedas with the
presiding beings of the three Regions, as described in the preceding
verse;—‘*the learned*’—wise men—‘*first*’— ‘*recite the essence of the
three Vedas*’— in the shape of (1) the syllable ‘*om*,’ (2) the
*Vyāhṛtis* (the syllables, ‘*bhūḥ bhuvaḥ—svaḥ*’) and (3) the ‘Sāvitrī’
verse—in this ‘*order*;’—and ‘*after this they recite the Veda*.’ By the
reciting of the said three ‘essences,’ all the three regions and the
three presiding beings become comprehended.

Though this matter has already been asserted in Discourse II, yet it is
repeated here; and this with a view to emphasise the fact, that—‘just as
one does not recite the Veda at a time that is unfit for study, so also
should he not recite it until he has previously recited *the essence of
the three Vedas*.’—(125).
