‘*As* *enliven the intelligence*,’—*e.g*., Itihāsas, Purāṇas, Treatises
on the Science of Reasoning, and also those written by Bṛhaspati, Uśanas
and others.

‘*Beneficial*’—productive of benefit; *i.e*., leading to perceptible
desirable results; such for instance, as the Sciences of Medicine and
Astronomy;—the Science of Polity being mentioned separately (under those
‘conducive to wealth’).

‘*Vedic Scriptures*.’—This term stands here for those sciences that are
helpful in understanding the meaning of the Veda; such sciences for
instance, as those of Exegesis. Etymologies, Grammar and Interpretation,

If the term stood for the Vedic texts themselves, these would be
conducive to imperceptible (and not perceptible) results.—(19).
