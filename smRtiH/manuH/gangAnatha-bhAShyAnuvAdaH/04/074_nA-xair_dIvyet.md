Even without stakes, in mere joke also, ‘*he shall never gamble with
dice*.’ The term ‘*never*’ is used for the purpose of precluding the use
of sticks, and such other implements also. Hence all kinds of gambling
are forbidden.

His shoes, made of leather, he shall not carry from one place to
another, ‘*himself*’—*i.e*., taking them in his own hand, or hanging
them on his stick. This prohibition applies to one’s own shoes, as is
clear from the term ‘himself;’ hence the carrying of the shoes belonging
to one’s Teacher or other superiors is not forbidden.

‘*On a bed*,’—seated on a conch, and such other things—‘*he shall not
eat*;’ nor placing the food-morsel on his hand; nor placing the food on
the sent, without an intervening dish. That this pertains to the food,
and not to the eater, is clear from the juxtaposition of what has gone
before.—(74)
