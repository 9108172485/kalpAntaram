This is an exaggerated deprecation of receiving gifts from Kings.

‘*Avaricious*’—who is in the habit of extracting riches from his
subsidiary chiefs.

‘*Who behaves contrary to the scriptures*’—he who acts against the laws
laid down under 11-2 *2 et. seq*., and inflicts undue punishments,
confiscates the women, and so forth.

‘*In succession*’—*i.e*., he goes to another hell after having
experienced the sufferings of one.

‘*Hell*.’—This term signifies *extreme suffering*; and, since *extreme
suffering* is all that is meant to be expressed, the singular number
would be the proper form; and the number ‘*twenty-one*’ is an
exaggerated description.—(87)
