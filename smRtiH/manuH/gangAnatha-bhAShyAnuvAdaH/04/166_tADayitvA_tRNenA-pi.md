‘*In anger*’—*i.e*., in a fit of wrath; not in joke; and
‘*intentionally*.’

‘*Ājāti*’ is *janma*, *birth*; the initial ‘*ā*’ being meaningless; just
as in the term, ‘*pralambate*, the initial ‘*pra*’ is meaningless.

‘*Sinful wombs*’—the wombs of sinful beings, *i.e*., the lower animals,
whose life is full of suffering.

To say nothing of more painful objects, by striking even by a straw, the
man suffers the pangs of hell for a long time.—(166).
