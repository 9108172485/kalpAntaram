‘*Each creature*’—living being—‘*is born alone*,’—and not along with his
friends and relations; and ‘*alone does it cease* *to be*;’ friends and
relations do not die with him. Even when one’s wife, or some other
devoted person, kills herself at the time of one’s death, this act of
*dying* is different from that of the man’s own dying; and, by this act,
the wife does not become born in the same womb with the husband, in the
way in which Atri was born.

Similarly, his good and evil deeds also the man enjoys himself.

“It has been said that neither one’s wife nor one’s sons help him; hut,
as a matter of fact, the son does help the father, by performing the
*śrāddha* and other rites; and so the wife also.”

True; but all that this mentis is that such a dutiful son is horn only
to a person who has acquired merit; and, just as during life, one is
helped by another person who supports him by the hand, so also, when the
man dies, his son helps him by means of religious acts.—(240)
