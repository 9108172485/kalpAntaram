The fourth ‘*muhūrta*’ of the night is ‘*midnight*,’ which is also
called ‘*mahāniśā*,’ ‘Deep Night.’ Two ‘*muhūrtas*’ before, and two
‘*muhūrtas*’ after this ‘midnight,’ it is unfit for study.

‘*In water*;’—*i.e*., while standing in a river or tank or some such
reservoir of water. Since the context is dealing with

‘Vedic study,’ the repeating of Vedic texts—such as ‘*Aghamarṣana*,’ and
the rest—in water is not forbidden.

Some people read ‘*udaye*’ for ‘*udake*;’ which means that it is unfit
for study when the sun has just risen.

‘*Unclean*;’—*i.e*., while he has not washed, after having taken his
food. One is also called ‘unclean’ before one has washed, after having
evacuated the bladder or the bowels. Some people explain that the term
‘*unclean*’ stands for all those impure conditions that require washing;
so that spitting also would become included.

‘*Even in his mind*.’—This does not mean that on other occasions unfit
for study, the *thinking* of Vedic texts is permitted; all that it means
is that the conditions here mentioned are more serious than the
rest.—(109)
