What is meant is the Brāhmaṇa endowed with all necessary
qualifications,—the term ‘Vedic Scholar’ being meant to be purely
illustrative. ‘*Vedic Scholar*’ means the learned man who performs all
the duties that have been laid down for him. If such a person happens to
be ‘*miserly*’—who does not take delight in receiving friends, relations
and guests, and who does not wish to give anything to any person.

The other person is the ‘*usurer*,’ living on usury, and thus engaged in
objectional business. If he happens to be ‘*liberal*,’ noble-minded,
endowed with faith, is delighted at the arrival of people at his house,
and duly honors them with food and other things.

The food belonging to these two persons the gods have ordained to be
‘*equal*.’

Even though one of them (the former) is possessed of all good qualities,
yet he is condemned by reason of his niggardliness. It has been declared
that ‘covetousness spoils all good qualities.’ The other person, even
though endowed with due faith, is censured by reason of his
objectionable business. Hence, ‘*having examined*’—duly pondered over
the matter—the gods have ordained that the food belonging to the two
persons stands on the same footing.—(224)
