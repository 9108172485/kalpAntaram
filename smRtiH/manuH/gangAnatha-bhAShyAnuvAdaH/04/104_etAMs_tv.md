any time: it is only when they appear, *after the Fires have been
lighted*,’ ‘*prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu*;’—*i.e*., at the time of twilight; as it
is only at these times that the Fires are always set ablaze for the
purpose of pouring the libations. The term ‘*prāduṣ*’ signifies
*visibility*.

‘*Out of season*.’—The ‘season’ is the Rainy season; other than this is
the time beginning with the autumn; During that time, if clouds *are
seen*. This also is meant to be taken along with the phrase, ‘*after the
Fires have been lighted*.’—(104).
