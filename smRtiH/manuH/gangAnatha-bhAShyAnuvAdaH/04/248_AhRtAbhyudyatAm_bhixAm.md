This verse asserts the acceptability of even things other than fuel and
the rest (mentioned in the preceding verse).

The term ‘*bhikṣā*,’ ‘*alms*,’ has been used in an appreciatory sense;
and it is not striclty *alms* that is meant here; though, in reality,
the term ‘*alms*’ denotes *a small quantity of cooked food*,—and it is
on account of smallness of its quantity that its acceptance is not
regarded as open to serious objection; Specially as, for the Student, it
has been permitted as coming from all castes. And what is meant by the
present text is that other things also may be treated on the same
footing. The term ‘alms’ is often found to be used in this sense;
*e.g*., in the *Mahābhārata* (1.206.1)—‘The two high-souled sons of
Pṛthā went to Pṛthā at the carpenter’s shop and joyously informed her of
their having received *Draupadi* as *alms*.’

‘*Brought forward*’—to that place where the recipient stands.

‘*Offered*’—placed before the recipient, who is told, either by a
gesture, or with actual words, to accept it. ‘*Previously*’—at any
previous time.

‘*Not begged*,’—not asked for by the recipient; nor promised by the
giver, either directly, or through some one else, to the effect
that,—‘such and such a thing there is in my house; please have the
kindness to accept it;’ only what is offered without premeditation,
actually thought of at the moment itself.

Such alms ‘*Prajāpati*’—Hiraṇyagarbha—*has declared*,—what?—*to be
acceptable even from* *a* *sinful person*,—the sinful person being one
whose actions are sinful—(248)
