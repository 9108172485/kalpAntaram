‘*Asṛk*’ is blood;—he who causes this to How from the body of the
Brāhmaṇa, by the stroke of the sword or such other weapons,—‘*even the
Brāhmaṇa is not fighting*—and not when he is actually taking part in
lawful battle, like Droṇācārya.

‘*Very great, suffering*’—in the form of hell.

‘*After death*,’—*i.e*., in another birth.

‘*Through folly*,’—This is a needless reiteration; the wise man, knowing
the scriptures, can never do such a thing.—(167).
