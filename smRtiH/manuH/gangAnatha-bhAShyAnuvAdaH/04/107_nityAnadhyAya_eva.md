Those who desire perfect merit, should not study in villages and
cities.—The term, ‘*dharma*,’ ‘*merit*’ *stands* for the *result* of
merit, in the shape of Heaven, &c. Or, the ‘perfection of merit’ may
consist in freedom from all contact with demerit; whereby the entire
purport of an Injunction becomes fulfilled. This would imply that the
said study may be permissible in cases of disability.

‘*Foul-smelling places*.’— There should be no studying in a place where
evil smell reaches the nose.

‘*All*’—*i*.*e*., in all cases of foul smell; *e.g*., even when there is
smell of a dead body.—(107)
