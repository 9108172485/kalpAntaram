“Since it has been laid down that one should pass urine, facing the
north,—and the sun rises in the east,—how can one ever face the sun, in
view of which possibility we have the present prohibition?”

The present verse is a commendatory supplement; just like the
assertion—‘not in the sky, nor in heaven, &c.’ Then again, during the
northern solstice, the sun moving towards the north, it would be
possible to face the sun. Or, the prohibition may be taken as meant for
the common people (who may not know the rule regarding urinating with
face towards the north).

Some people read ‘*pratisandhyam*.’ But this is not right; because
regarding the passing of urine we have the rule that ‘during the two
twilights it shall be done as during the day;’ and also because the
forcible checking of urine, etc., has been forbidden. For these reasons,
we should read ‘*prativātam*,’ facing the wind.’

This verse is supplementary to the foregoing one.

‘*Mehakaḥ*’—may be construed either as ending with the
Present-participial affix ‘*śatṛ*,’ or with the affix ‘*tas*’ (having
the sense of the Ablative); the meaning being—‘the man passing urine,’
or ‘by the passing of urine.’—(49)
