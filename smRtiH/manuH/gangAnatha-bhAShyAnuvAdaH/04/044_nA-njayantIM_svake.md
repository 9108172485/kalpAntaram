One who is applying collyrium to another’s eyes, looks beautiful (hence
there is no harm in looking at her).

‘*Uncovered*’— with her clothing removed. As a rule, men long for
locking at a woman only when she is veiled; while, when the woman is
undressed, all her limbs become visible, and, on scrutiny, nil these may
not turn out to be shapely; consequently, one should avoid looking at a
naked woman.

‘*Desiring brightness*.’—‘Brightness’ stands for brightness of
complexion, as also for energy.—(44)
