One’s slaves are one’s own shadow; just as one’s shadow always follows
one, and is never an object of resentment, so also are one’s slaves.

‘*The daughter is the object of tenderness* ’—*i.e*., sympathy.

‘*By these*’—aforesaid persons—‘*when offended*’—attacked, made angry,
by harsh words—‘he shall bear it,’—‘*asajavaraḥ*,’ ‘*without
heat*;’—this ‘absence of heat’ stands for the total absence of any
disturbance of the mind or resentment; a man in feverish heat has his
mind disturbed, so is also the man under resentment. Or, we may read
‘*asañjvaraḥ*,’—‘*sañjvaraḥ*’ being synonymous with ‘santāpa,’ ‘heat’
(according to *Amarakośa*); and this is prohibited by means of the
negative prefix.—(185).
