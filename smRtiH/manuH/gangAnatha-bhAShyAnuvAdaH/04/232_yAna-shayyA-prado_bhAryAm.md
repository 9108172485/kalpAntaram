‘*Sovereignly*,’— the position of the master, lordship,

‘*Happiness*’—being happy.

‘*Grains*’—such as *Vrīhi, Māṣa, Mudga*, and so forth. In connection
with the giving of sesamum, another result has been described.

‘*Brahman*’ means *Veda*; ‘*ṛṣṭi*’ is *condition*;—‘*sāṛṣṭi*’ is one who
has the same condition;—the change of ‘*samāna*’ into ‘*sa*’ being the
Vedic form;—‘*ṛṣṭi*’ is derived from the root ‘*ṛṣi*,’ to ‘go;’—or
‘*sāṛṣṭi*’ may mean the character of *acting*. In another case, the
meaning is that he obtains ‘equality’ with—the same condition of
existence as—Brahman.—(232)
