What is said here has already been said before; it is reiterated here
for the purpose of laying down the additional details that follow.

‘*No guest shall dwell in his house unhonoured*.’—That is, all guests
should be lodged in the house after being honoured.

‘*To the best of his ability*.’— One or two, or several,—as many as can
he duly honoured—shall be honoured with seat and other things. What is
meant is that when guests are living in one’s house, all these things
should be provided for them, in a respectful manner; it does not mean
that one should give away one’s proprietary right over all these
articles in.the house. Since ‘fruits and roots’ have been mentioned
separately, it follows that these are to be given only in the event of
other kinds of food, in the shape of rice, juice, meat and butter, being
not available.—(29)
