“It is not right that the consequences of acts done by one person should
be described as falling on others. As a matter of fact, all Vedic acts
bring their fruits to the person who performs them. The principle of the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice (whereby the fruits of the sacrifice accrue to
the son of the performer) cannot be held to be applicable to the present
case, as there is no direct assertion to that effect. In connection with
the acts dealt with in the present context, there is no assertion to the
effect that their consequences accrue to the performer’s son.”

True; but when the son suffers pain, it causes the father still greater
pain; so that, in that case also, the resultant suffering would fall
upon the perpetrator himsef (himself?). As regards the son also, the
said suffering may be said to come to him by virtue of some past misdeed
of his son; and there would be nothing incongruous in this.

The same holds good regarding ‘*grandsons*’ also.

‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*.’—Whether the component words be read as
‘*Kṛtaḥ-dharmaḥ*’ or ‘*Kṛtaḥ-adharmaḥ*,’ the resultant conjunct form
would be the same—‘*Kṛto-dharmaḥ*;’ hence both *dharma* (righteousness)
and *adharma* (unrighteousness) are meant to be spoken of (as not
failing in bringing up their consequences)—(173).
