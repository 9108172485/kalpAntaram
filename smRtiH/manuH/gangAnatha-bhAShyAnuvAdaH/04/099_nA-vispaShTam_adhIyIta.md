‘*Indistinct*’—when the letters and accents are not clearly pronounced.
This happens when a man is reciting hurriedly.

‘*At the end of night*’— in the latter part of night. If he, on rising
from sleep, study the Veda, he shall not, if he becomes tired, go to
sleep again. The right reading is—‘*na niśānte pariśrānto brahmādhītya
śayīta tu*.’—(99)
