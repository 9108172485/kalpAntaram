‘*Preternatural sound*’— an ominous sound emanating from the sky.

‘*Of planets*’—Moon, Sun, Jupiter, and the rest.

‘*Impact*’—*i.e*., a halo round them, or mutual contact.

‘*Even during the season*.’—‘Even’ has been added with a view to the
fact that portents are not regarded as such, during the rains.—(105).
