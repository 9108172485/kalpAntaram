He who has not performed any austerities and who does not study the
Veda:—this ‘studying’ stands for the full knowledge of the Veda, which
is what has been referred to in the text. Both these qualifications
combined are necessary for entitling a man to receive gifts.

He who does not possess these two qualifications, and yet hankers after
gifts, ‘*sinks along with* *him*;’—with whom?—Since no other person is
mentioned, and the *giver* is the person mentioned in close proximity to
the present context, it follows that it is along with the giver that the
receiver sinks. The giver has recourse to the Recipient, for the purpose
of crossing over (to heaven); if, therefore, the recipient happen to be
unqualified, he makes both himself and the giver sink into water; just
as the ‘*stone-raft*,’—the raft made of stone—does in water. ‘*Raft*’ is
that by which people cross rivers, such as boat and other things. One
who gets on a piece of stone for crossing a river sinks into the water
along with the stone-raft; in the same manner, the giver of gifts to the
unqualified Brāhmaṇa, and the Brāhmaṇa receiving the gifts,—both go to
hell.—(l 90).
