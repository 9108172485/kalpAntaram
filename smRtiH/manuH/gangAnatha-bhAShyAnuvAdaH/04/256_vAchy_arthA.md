The relation between words and their denotations being eternal, things
are described as ‘*regulated by speech*.’

‘*Have their root in speech*.’— Things are said to have their root in
speech, in view of the fact that the ideas of the speaker depend, for
their manifestation, upon speech.

‘*Emanate from speech*,’—are produced out of speech; things are so
called, because the ideas of the hearer also are dependent upon speech.

It is not necessary to suspect, or attempt an explanation of, the
repetition here involved; because what is stated here is merely a
description of things as they are, and as such may be put forward in any
manner possible.

He who ‘*steals such speech*’—misrepresents, having said one thing, does
something else; he says something in one sense, and represents it in
another sense;—‘*is the stealer of all things*;’—there is no substance,
gold or anything else, which such a man has not stolen.

This is an *imaginary* statement, deprecatory of *telling a
lie*.—(*256*)
