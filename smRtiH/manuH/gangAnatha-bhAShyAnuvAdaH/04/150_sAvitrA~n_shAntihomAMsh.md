The exact forms of the afore-mentioned oblations are now described.

‘*Oblations to Savitṛ*.’—Those that are offered to Savitṛ as the deity.

‘*Special days*;’—*i.e*., on the Moonless and the Full Moon Days—the
said oblations are to be offered.

‘*Pacificatory oblations*—the oblations that are offered for the purpose
of averting evil.

At all these oblations, Clarified Butter is to be the substance offered;
for, in regard to all oblations, it has been declared that, where no
substance is specified, Clarified Butter is to be used, by such passages
as—‘what is called Clarified Butter is used at all sacrifices.’

The Locative ending in ‘*parvasu*’ (‘on special days’) has the force of
the Accusative; as the *receptacle* (which is what is denoted by the
Locative) of the oblation is Fire, which is never the *object*; the
*objects* offered being mentioned as—‘fried grain,’ ‘butter,’ ‘meat,’
‘mixed Hour,’ ‘curd,’ ‘milk’ and ‘grains.’

These oblations are mentioned here for the first time, and the exact
procedure of these has been described before, as learnt from usage.

‘*Aṣṭakā*.’—The three eighth days of the three dark fort nights
following after the Full Moon Day of the month of ‘*Āgrahāyaṇa*;’
according to some, it stands for the four eighth days of the four dark
fortnights during the *Hemanta* and *Śiśira seasons*.—On these days,
‘*he shall worship the pitṛs*’—‘by means of *śraḍdha*; the J;erm
‘*pitṛ*,’ standing for one’s dead ancestors—‘*Anvaṣṭakā*’ is the name of
the ninth days following the aforesaid ‘*aṣṭakās*.’—(150).
