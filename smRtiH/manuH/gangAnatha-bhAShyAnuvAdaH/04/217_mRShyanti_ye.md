The man mentioned in the preceding verse is one who does not know of the
presence of his wife’s paramour; while the one mentioned here is one who
knows it, and suffers it, and does not check his wife. If the man does
not know of the presence of the paramour, who comes from another house,
then the food given by such a man is not forbidden.

‘*Who are ruled by women*,’—those persons in whose house the wife is the
sole mistress and dispenser; and who are not master of themselves or of
their dependants; who are entirely under the control of their wives.

‘*Pretānnam*;’—when one is impure, on account of death in his house, the
food belonging to the members of his family is forbidden.—‘*Ten days
have not passed*;’—this indicates the period of time.

If the term, ‘*anirdaśam*’ (of verse 212), is to be taken by itself, as
forbidding the food belonging to ‘impure’ persons, then ‘the food
belonging to persons in whose house there has been death’ being already
included there, the present term would stand for the food of those
persons who are directly connected with the impurity; such persons, for
instance, as the friends and maternal relations of the dead. Similarly,
one shall not eat the food belonging to one who may be engaged in the
performance of such rites as the

‘*Caturthī-Śrāddha*,’ and the like, which is undertaken through sympathy
with the person in whose house the death has occurred. Such *śrāddhas*
have been mentioned by the Authors of *Gṛhyasūtras*, as also in the
*Rāmāyaṇa*, in such passages as—‘The *tenth-day Śrāddha*, the *Ninth-day
Śrāddha*, the *Eighth-day Śrāddha*, the *Fourth-day Śrāddha*, etc.’

‘*What is disagreeable*;’—by eating which one does not feel happy.—(217)
