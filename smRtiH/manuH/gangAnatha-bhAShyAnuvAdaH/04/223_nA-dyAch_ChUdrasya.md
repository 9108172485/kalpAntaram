Śūdra’s food has been forbidden generally; and particular details
regarding it are now laid down—‘*who does not perform Śrūddhas*.

“Where has Śūdra’s food been forbidden?”

It has been forbidden in 4. 211.

“What is forbidden there is Śūdra’s *leavings*, and not other kinds of
food.”

Not so; the said verse (211) is to be construed as—‘the Śūdra’s food
should not be eaten, *nor the leavings of others*.’ The explanation that
we gave above of this verse, was in accordance with the older
Commentators; as we clearly pointed out there.

‘*Who does not perform Śrāddhas*.’—‘*Śrāddha*’ here stands for the
*sacrificing of cooked food* and such other rites as have been
prescribed for the Śūdra; hence, the meaning is ‘who does nor perform
these rites.’ What is meant is that ‘one shall not eat the cooked food
of any *Śūdra*, except those of the better class.’

Another reading is ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ (for ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*); which means,
‘who is devoid of faith;’ in the next verse also we find special stress
laid down upon ‘faith,’ by the term ‘*vadānya*,’ ‘liberal.’

‘*Raw*’—dry; paddy, rice, and so forth.

‘*Sufficient for one day*’—just that quantity which may suffice for one
day,—not more.—(223)
