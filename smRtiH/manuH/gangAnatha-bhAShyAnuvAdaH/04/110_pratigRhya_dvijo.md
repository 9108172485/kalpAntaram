The ‘Unitary Rite’ is that which is offered to a single ancestor;
*i.e*., the fresh funeral rite (that which is performed after
death);—having ‘*accepted*’—agreed to—‘*invitation*’ at that rite, it
becomes an occasion unfit for study, for three days, counting from the
day of the invitation.

Similarly, when ‘*of the King*’—*i.e*., of the Moon—there is
‘*impurity*,’ *i.e*., pouring of nectar towards Rāhu. ‘*Also*’ in this
case, is meant to include the *Sun* also.

Or, the ‘*impurity of the King*’ may mean the rejoicings accompaying the
birth of a son to the *King*, the ruler of men; and the ‘*impurity of
the Rāhu*,’ for the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, known as
‘*grahaṇa*,’ ‘catching.’—(110)
