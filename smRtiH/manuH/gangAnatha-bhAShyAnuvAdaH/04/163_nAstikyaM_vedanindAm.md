‘*Atheism*’ consists in thinking, as untrue, of things that are spoken
of in the Veda.

‘*Cavilling*’ is giving verbal expression to such ideas as—‘the Veda is
full of needless repetitions and self-contradictions,’ ‘there is nothing
true in it,’—with an evil intent, and not merely by way of propounding a
discussion on these points.

‘*Gods*’—*i.e*., Agni and the rest; the ‘abusing’ of these stands for
‘talking ill of them.’ *E.g*. people are found to make such assertions
as—‘we have been struck by the wretched gods.’

‘*Hatred*’—ill-feeling aroused by jealousy, etc.

‘*Haughtiness*’—want of humility, due to pride.

‘*Pride*’—Vanity regarding oneself: ‘I am very learned,’ ‘I am very
rich,’ and so forth.

‘*Anger*’—wrath.

‘*Harshness*’—cruelty; *i.e*., anger preceded by hatred, (163)
