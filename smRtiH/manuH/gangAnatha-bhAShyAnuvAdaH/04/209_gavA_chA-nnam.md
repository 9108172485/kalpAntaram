‘*Food publicly offered*,’—the food that is given at temples or
sacrificial sessions, by public notice, to all coiners, without any
invitation to individuals. Or, it may mean ‘what is given to one person
after having been promised to another.’

The root, ‘*Ghuṣ*’ has been declared to mean *to announce*; so that
people regard the present verse as refering to cases where there is no
announcement; and what is forbidden, therefore, is eating, *without
invitation*, at sacrifices, marriages and such other functions.

The ‘*gaṇa*,’ meant by the text is *multitude*, *company*; hence the
name is not applied to a number of brothers living together undivided.
It is declared in Discourse IX that ‘there is a single duty operating
among brothers living jointly’; and the duty therein referred to is the
*receiving of guests*, and so forth; all which is made clear under
9.105, where the ‘eldest brother’ is declared as inheriting the entire
parental property; and it is this inheritance that indicates his
liability to fulfil the duties also.

What is forbidden is what is not induced in the parental heritage, even
though it belong in common to all.

‘*Harlot*’ is the public woman.

‘*Censured*’— deprecated,—‘*by the learned*’,—even though it be
something edible; *e.g*., the lotus-stalk, the oil-cake, and so
forth.—(209)
