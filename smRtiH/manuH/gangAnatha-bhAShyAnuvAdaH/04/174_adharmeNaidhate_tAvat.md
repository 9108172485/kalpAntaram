‘*Through unrighteousness*,’—such as causing injury to his master, and
so forth—‘*he prospers*’—gains advancement.

‘*For a time*,’—for the time being only.

Then, ‘*for a while*’—after having gained riches and lands,—‘*he
experiences*’—enjoys—‘*good things*;’—*i.e*., such signs of prosperity
as the presence of many servants, the possession of cattle, horses, and
so forth.

Then, ‘*he conquers his enemies*’—*i.e*., ill-treats such persons as are
poor. What are meant by ‘enemies’ are those persons who, remaining firm
in the path of righteousness, do not have recourse to questionable means
of livelihood; and, in comparison to a rich person, the poverty of such
men would involve a certain amount of *insult*.

Having remained thus for some time, such persons become destroyed ‘*root
and branch*,’ ‘*i.e*., along with their children, relations and riches.

For these reasons, righteousness should not be forsaken.—(1 74).
