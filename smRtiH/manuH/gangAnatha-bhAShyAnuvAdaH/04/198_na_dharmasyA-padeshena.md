‘*Having committed a sin, he shall not perform a penance*,’—in the shape
of an expiatory rite;—‘*under the pretext of doing a righteous
act*;’—pretending righteousness, he makes it known among people that he
is doing the penance purely as a religious act., and that there has been
no occasion for his doing it as an expiatory rite; though, in reality,
he is doing it as an expiatory rite. This is what one should not do.

‘*By covering sin*,’—by concealing his sin—one shall not—by means of the
said righteous act—seek to deceive ‘*women and Śūdras*.’

The meaning is that, when one has to perforin an expiatory rite, one
shall openly perform it as such, except in the case of the Expiatory
Rites distinctly laid down as ‘secret’—(198).
