This rule applies to cases where, when a man has started to go, the said
things happen to come in his way. He should go in such a manner
that-they remain to his right. Another *Smṛti* has laid down, in
connection with depatures, that—‘he should walk round rightwards.’

‘*Deity*’—as painted on scrolls, for purposes of worshipping. Gautama
has declared that—‘One shall pass round the temples of gods leaving them
on his right;’ and, on the strength of popular opinion, the term
‘*deity*’ of the text is to be taken as standing for the temples
containing images of the Four-armed *Viṣṇu*, the Sun and other gods;—and
the same should be done with sacrificial houses also, as the author is
going to declare later on.

‘*Madhu*’—should be taken here as standing for *Honey*, on the strength
of its being mentioned along with ‘clarified batter;’ also because it is
mentioned in the middle of a number of auspicious things.

‘*Well-known* *trees*’— Large trees, well known for their great utility
and size, or, for the large produce of flower and fruits; such trees,
for instance, as the *Udumbara*, and the like. ‘The Udumbara is vigour
itself,’ says a Vedic description.

Some people have explained ‘*well known*’ as ‘of superior quality.’ But
these people, have no support for this, except certain popular notions;
and they should be ignored.—(39)
