‘*Nipāna*,’— which is etymologically explained as ‘*nipibanti asmin*,’
or ‘*nipibanti asmāt*,’ — ‘in which, or from which, people drink,’—means
‘water-reservoir;’ that is, a tank, a well or a tank. And one should
never bathe in any such tank as has been dug by another man for his own
use, and has not been given away for the benefit of the public.

This forbids all kinds of bathing—(*a*) the obligatory daily bath, (*b*)
the occasional bath necessitated by the touch of the Cāṇḍāla and such
other persons, and (*c*) the ordinary bath taken for the relieving of
heat and perspiration.

The text proceeds to point out the evil arising from the disobedience of
the said prohibition he becomes ‘*tainted*’—contaminated—by a part of
such sin as there may be of the person who dug the tank.

This is a deprecatory exaggeration, supplementing the preceding
prohibition,—(201)
