The text proceeds to show the manner of ‘offering himself.’

‘*As may be the character of the man*,’—*i.e*., the family, the country
and the profession to which the *Śūdra* concerned may belong.

‘*The work he wishes to do*;’—saying, ‘This is the work that I shall do
under you, either as my duty, or for s ome other purpose, such as saving
myself from being pressed for service at the royal palace, and so
forth.’

‘*The manner in which he may serve*;’—‘I shall serve you with this act
of mine;’—‘I shall press your feet, and do other household work.’ When
one offers to do all this, then is he said to have ‘*offered himself*.’

‘Others have taken the word,’ ‘*Ātman*’ ‘himself,’ in the expression,
‘*Ātmanām nivedayet*,’ ‘offers himself,’ to mean *child*—according to
the text, ‘thou art my own self, named *son*;’ and have explained it to
mean that ‘one may eat the food of the *Śūdra*, whose *daughter*
(*ātma*) one may have married, under the influence of sexual passion.’
This, however, is not right. The term, ‘ātmā’ is never used directly in
the sense of *daughter*; it is only the masculine form ‘*putra*,’ ‘son,’
that is often found to be so used; and there would be no useful purpose
served by the Author using a term, in an indirect sense; it would have
been enough to say—‘he who gives his daughter to him.’

Others have explained that the mention of the ‘ploughman’ and others is
meant to be indicative of the *Śūdra* in general; so that it follows
that one may cat the food of one’s father-in-law of the ‘*Pāraśava*’
caste (son of a Brāhmaṇa from a *Śūdra* mother).—(254)
