The result mentioned in the preceding verse accrues in the case of light
hurt; when, however, the hurt is serious,—‘*as many particles of dust
are taken up*’—coagulated—by the blood falling from the Brāhmaṇa’s body,
on the ground;—‘*during so many years*’—‘*in the other world*’—The
‘*blood-spiller*’—the man who struck—‘*is devoured*’ by dogs and
jackals.—(168).
