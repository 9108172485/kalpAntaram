This is another method prescribed for the Householder.

Debts to the Great Sages are paid by Vedic Study; those to the *Pitṛs*
are paid by the begetting of children; and those to the Gods are paid by
sacrifices. This is what has been described in the passage—‘The Brāhmaṇa
is under three kinds of debts.’

‘*Gatvā*’—having brought, about the three forms of freedom from debt.

‘*He shall consign*’—make over—‘*everything*’—the entire business of the
house and family—‘*to his son*’—who has attained the age of business.

He shall remain in the house ‘*fixed in neutrality*’—*i.e*., having
resigned all egoism. That is, ‘he shall continue to dwell in the house,
having relinquished all such notions as *this is my wealth, these my son
and wife, these my male and female slaves.‘Neutrality*’ consists in the
feeling, ‘I do not belong to any one, no one belongs to me,’ in which
all desire is abandoned.

What is meant is the^(‘)renunciation’ of only ordinary voluntary acts
done for some purpose, and not of all (even obligatory) acts; as we
shall show later on.—(257)
