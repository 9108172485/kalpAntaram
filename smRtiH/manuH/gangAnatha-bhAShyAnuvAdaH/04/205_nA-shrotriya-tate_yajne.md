The preceding verse has closed the section on Positive Duties; now
begins the section on prohibitions (Negative Duties).

Among the various acts it is that of eating which is likely to be done
at random,—food being what is sought after most; hence the text proceeds
with prohibitions regarding the act of eating.

‘*Aśrotriya*,’ ‘*Non-śrotriya*,’ is *one who has not learnt the Veda*;
at the sacrifice ‘*performed*’—undertaken—by him,—or at sacrifice at
which the officiating priests are ignorant of the *Veda*—‘*the Brāhmaṇa
shall not eat*.’

‘*Village-priest*,’—one who officiates as the priest of the entire
village; where such a person, or a woman, offers the sacrifice.

In the *Chāndogya*, the authors of the *Gṛhya* -rules have described the
performance of sacrifices by women, and it is in view of this that the
text forbids eating at such sacrifices. Or, the prohibition may refer to
that sacrifice at which the woman is the principal performer; her
husband being beset with poverty and other disqualifications, and the
woman being proud of the wealth acquired by her as dowry, or of the
wealth possessed by her relations.

‘*Eunuch*’— wanting in masculinity.—(205)
