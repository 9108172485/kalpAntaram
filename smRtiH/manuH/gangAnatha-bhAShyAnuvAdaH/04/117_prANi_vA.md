The rice and other things that are given in connection with *Śrāddhas*
are generally known as ‘*śrāddhika*,’ ‘*śrāddha-gift*;’ and it is with a
view to show that, in the present context it is not this alone that is
meant, that the present verse is added; the sense being—it is not only
the acceptance of *Vrīhi*, Rice and other grains that makes the occasion
unfit for study; but other things, also—be they ‘*animate*’—in the shape
of the cow and other animals—‘*or inaminate*’ in the shape of pairs of
cloth, etc,.—having accepted such a thing,—*i.e*., after having touched
it with his hand, at the time of acceptance—the man shall not study.
Because the act itself constitutes the act of ‘eating.’ ‘*Pāṇyāsya*’ is
one whose hand is his mouth. What this means is the eating at a
*śrāddha* and accepting gifts in connection with it—both stand on the
same footing.—(117)
