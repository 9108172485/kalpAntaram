The term ‘property’ is meant to imply that the giving of *food* is not
forbidden.

‘*Though acquired by laicful means*,’—such as gifts from proper sources,
by purchase and such other means as are permitted by the scriptures.

Such giving becomes a source of trouble to both the giver and the
receiver in the next world.—(193).
