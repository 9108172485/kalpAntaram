This is the final summing up of the foregoing rules forbidding the
acceptance of gifts.

Knowing that the accepting of gifts from kings is the source of various
forms of suffering, learned Brāhmaṇas should not accept gifts from
kings.

‘*After death*’—*i.e*., in the next birth;—‘*welfare*’— good;—those who
desire. The term ‘*pretya*,’ which has the form of a participle, is a
totally different word.

‘*Brahma*’ is Veda; those who ‘*read*,’ study it.

The epithets, ‘*learned*’ and ‘*reading the Vedas*,’ have been added
with a view to indicate the excessive character of the suffering. Such
persons suffer the greatest pains, resulting from the said acceptance of
gifts; as it is going to be declared—‘the learned man should fight shy
of that.’—(91).
