The nature of things is such that, even though an act may be done with a
view to a certain end, yet its other results also accrue to him. For
instance, when one is intent upon obeying one’s Teacher, it is with a
view to the fulfilment of a religious duty, and not for obtaining
pleasure; and yet, from the very nature of the thing, the act of
obedience brings pleasure.

Some people bold the following opinion:—“Penances serve the purpose of
removing sins; and even though performed with a view to other ends, they
do not renounce their own nature. So that, in the case in question, the
Expiatory Rite would serve both purposes,—I shall become known by the
people as *righteous*, and my sin also shall be removed.”

It is with a view to setting aside such a view that the Author adds the
present verse.

‘*The penance done under a false pretence goes to evil spirits*;’—that
is, it becomes useless, and it does not remove the sin.

It is not only that his purpose is not accomplished, in fact, such
Brāhmaṇas—those performing penances under false pretences—‘*are
condemned*’—reprehended—‘*by the expounders of the Veda*;’ *i.e*., by
the cultured people, who know the authority of the Veda.—(199).
