Before the act of eating, one shall observe the rule that ‘one should
eat with wet feet;’ it is not meant that he should go on wetting his
feet till he has finished eating and become fully satisfied.

‘*Shall not deep*’—*i.e*., he shall not lay down his body upon the bed;
‘*samveśana*,’ ‘sleeping,’ standing for the *laying down of the body on
the bed*.

The reason for this is next mentioned—‘*Long life*.’—It does not mean
that the injunction is meant only for one who desires long life (and for
none others); in fact, like the preceding ones, this also is obligatory;
and the mention of ‘long life’ is purely illustrative.—(76)
