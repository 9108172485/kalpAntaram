‘*Vatsatantrī*’ is the rope to which the calf is tethered; or, it may
mean ‘a line of calves.’ This ‘*he shall* *not* *step over*’— not cross
over. Says Gautama (9.52)—‘One shall not pass over the *vatsatantrī*.’

‘*Figure*’—shape of the body.

‘*Own*’— The addition of this implies that looking at the figure of
other persons is not forbidden.

‘*Such is the established rule*,’—ordained in the scriptures—(38).
