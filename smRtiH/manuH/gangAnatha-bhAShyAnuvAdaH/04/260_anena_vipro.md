This describes the result of all that has gone before.

‘*The Brāhmaṇa, learned in the Vedic scriptures, who conducts himself by
this course of life, has his sins*’—arising from doing what is
forbidden—‘*removed*’—by means of Expiatory Rites. The meaning is that
by doing what is enjoined, and by avoiding what is forbidden, and by
expiating by means of rites those sins that may happen to be
committed,—‘*becomes exalted in the region of Brahman*;— or, according
to another theory, be becomes of the same nature as Brahman—(260)

Thus ends Discourse IV.
