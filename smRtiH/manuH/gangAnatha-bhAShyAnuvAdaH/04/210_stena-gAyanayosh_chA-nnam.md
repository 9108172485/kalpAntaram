‘*Singer*,’— Who lives by singing. The ordinary occasional singing of
popular songs is actually laid down.

‘*Miser*’— niggard.

The difference between the ‘prisoner’ and the ‘fettered’ is, that the
former may be imprisoned by mere words (verbal orders), while the latter
is actually bound in ropes and iron-chains.

Some people read ‘*viśadasya*’ for ‘*nigadasya*;’—‘*viśaḍa*’ being
explained as ‘man in trouble.’—(210)
