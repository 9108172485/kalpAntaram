‘Without *knowing*, etc.’—One shall not accept gifts merely for the
purpose of enjoying pleasures, etc. The meaning is that one shall accept
gifts only for the maintaining of one’s family, and for the due
accomplishment of ones obligatory duties,—and for no other purpose.

‘*Even though he may be pining with hunger*.’—That is, if, without
accepting the gift, he should suffer emaciation; ‘emaciation’ standing
for non-development of the body.

Or, we may construe the passage as ‘*dravyāṇām vidhim dharmyam
pratigrahe*.—What is the ‘*dharmaya vidhi*,’ ‘the legal injunction?’—It
would consist in the full knowledge of the purpose, the deity, the
*mantra* and other details connected with the gift; such as—‘Gold is
given in honour of Agni, the cow in honour of Rudra,’ and so
forth.—(187)
