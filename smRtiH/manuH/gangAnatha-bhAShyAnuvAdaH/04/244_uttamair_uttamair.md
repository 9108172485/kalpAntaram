The word, ‘*uttumaiḥ*,’ has been repeated, in view of the fact that
there are several kinds of ‘superior’ people; some are ‘superior’ in
*caste*, some in *learning*, some in *character*. Or, the repetition may
be due to diversity of connections; some connections being desirable for
some kinds of ‘superior’ people, and some with the other.

‘*With superior people*’—w ith people superior in caste, etc.,—‘*he
shall form connections*’ of marriage, etc.

‘*Being desirous of raising his family to eminence*’—to a superior
status.

‘*He shall avoid the inferior kinds*.’—The injunction that connections
shall he formed with superior people, implies that those with inferior
people shall be avoided; the emphasizing of this latter, therefore, is
meant to permit the forming of connections with middle class people, if
superior people are not available.

‘*Inferior*’—low.—(244)
