Fire should be blown with deer-skin-fans and such things.

‘*He shall not look at a naked woman*’—‘apart from sexual intercourse,’
says another Smṛti-text.

‘*Unclean thing*’—‘*ameḍhya*—‘*medha*’ means- *sacrifice*; ‘*medhya*’ is
*fit for use at sacrifice*; and ‘*amedhya*’ is *unfit* for use at
sacrifices; such things, for instance, as onions, urine, excreta, and so
forth. Anything like this, he shall not throw into fire.

He shall not raise his feet directly towards the fire and warm them at
it. There is no objection to the feet being covered and then warmed for
the purpose of exciting perspiration.—(53).
