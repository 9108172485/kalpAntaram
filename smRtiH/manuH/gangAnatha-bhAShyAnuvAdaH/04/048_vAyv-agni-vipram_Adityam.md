What is meant is that one shall not do the act facing the wind; and the
other things he shall not look at, while urinating, even by turning his
body towards them. Since *wind* is colourless, its *seeing* can only he
ascertained by seeing the flight of leaves, hits of earth and other
things waft

ed by the wind. This prohibition would be incongruous if it applied to
the entire *air-circle* (atmosphere); since wind is blowing
everywhere.—(48)

As a commendatory supplement to this we have the next verse.
