At midday—at midnight—after having eaten, at a Śrāddha, food mixed with
meat—‘*he shall not have recourse to a cross-road*;’ *i.e*., shall not
stay there for any length of time. If, however, on his way; to another
village, there is no other way save through the cross-road, his having
recourse to it to that extent is not forbidden.

Some people add a further ‘*ca*,’ and explain the text to mean, ‘after
having eaten at a *śrāddha, and* after having partaken of meat-food.’

Under this explanation, however, it would be necessary to seek for some
usage in support of this; as without some such corroborative usage,
there can be no justification for such disjointed construction.—(131)
