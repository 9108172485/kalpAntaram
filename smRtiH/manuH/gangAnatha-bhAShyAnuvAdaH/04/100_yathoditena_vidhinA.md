The term ‘*verse*’ stands for the ‘*Gāyatrī*’ and other metres; and the
Veda *with* these, is the *Ṛgveda*, and also the *Sāma Veda*. The term
‘*kṛta*’ is used here in the sense of *association*, the root ‘*kṛ*’
having several significations, it is explained as denoting ‘association’
in the present context. The root ‘*kṛ*’ has the sense of ‘*collecting*’
in such expressions as ‘*gomayān kuru*’ (collect cowdung),—it has the
sense of *rubbing*, in the expression ‘*pṛṣṭham kuru*’ (Rub the back);
similarly, in the present text it means ‘association.’

‘*Brahmachandaskṛtam*’—that which is in verse and prose. In the
Yajurveda, there are prose-passages, as also Mantras composed in the
*Gāyatrī* and other metres; both kinds of passages being found in the
same chapter. It is not so in the Ṛgveda or in the Sāma Veda; in both of
which the *mantras* (in metre) form one part and the *Brāhmaṇas* (prose)
form a distinct part. It is on the basis of this difference in the
character of the Vedas that the text mentions them in the way in which
it has done. Thus have the older writers explained the text.

‘*According to rule*’—This sums up the rules laid down in connection
with normal times. In abnormal times, one would need the presence of the
Teacher for enlightening him regarding the distinction mentioned in the
text; and if, on that account, he were not to repeat the texts, he would
forget them; hence, in this case, the aforesaid distinction need not be
observed.—(100)
