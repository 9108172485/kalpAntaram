‘*Untrained*’—*i.e*., not trained; oxen, horses, mules and so forth,
which are yoked to chariots, etc. The use of ‘*ca*’ indicates that one
shall not ride upon untrained beasts,???en (even?) when they are not
yoked to chariots, etc.

The ‘injured horn’ pertains to the *ox* only; as that alone has horns,
and not horses and other animals.

‘*Bāladhi*’ is *tail*; those that have been disfigured by their tails;
whose tails have been cut off.

One should not travel on such animals. Another Smṛti text prohibits
merely getting upon the back of such animals.—(67)
