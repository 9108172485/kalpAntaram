+++
Being of one kind,;—*i.e*., unrighteous—if he describes himself to
‘*good men*’—to cultured people—‘*otherwise*’—describing himself as
*righteous*;—or, when he goes to a man for one purpose, and represents
it to be something else,—such a person is the worst of all sinners.

‘*Thief*’— stealer;—‘*stealing himself*.’ Other thieves steal things,
while this person steals himself. This shows the despicable character of
the man.—(255)
