If one is unable to bestow a large gift, or perform a difficult
austerity, or offer an elaborate sacrifice—like the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest,—he should not he despondent on that account; on the contrary, he
should ‘*slowly*’ and gently ‘accumulate spiritual merit,’ by means of
small gifts, small austerities, by helping others, to the best of his
ability, and by muttering prayers and offering oblations prescribed in
the *Smṛtis*; just in the same manner in which white ants accumulate the
*ant-hill*.

‘*For the purpose of obtaining a companion in the other world*.’—This
describes the fruits of spiritual merit.

‘*Without causing pain to any beings*;’ *i.e*., even for the sake of
spiritual merit, he shall not go about begging and thereby causing pain
to others.—(238)
