Whenever a man breathes, he should think—‘I am offering speech into
Life-breath;’ and when he speaks, he should think—‘I am offering
Life-breath into Speech.’ By this alone the Five Sacrifices become
accomplished.

“If these are obligatory, they should not be spoken of as leading to any
results.”

As a matter of fact, only such persons are entitled to this form of
sacrifice as are cognisant of the real nature of the Soul.

This same fact has been laid down in the Upṇniṣads, in connection with
‘the worship of the Five Fires,’ and in great detail in the *Kauṣitaki
Brāhmaṇa*.

‘*Imperishable*’—in their results; their results consisting in
non-return to the cycle of birth and rebirth.—(23)
