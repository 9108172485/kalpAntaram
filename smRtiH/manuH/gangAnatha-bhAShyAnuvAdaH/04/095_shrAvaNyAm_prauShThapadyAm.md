The full moon day related to the asterism of *Śravaṇā* is called
‘*Śrāvaṇī*;’ similarly, ‘*Prauṣṭhapadī*.’—On either of these
days,—‘*having performed the rite known as* “*Upākarma*,”’—he shall
study the Vedas,—‘*according to rule*;’ this refers to the rules laid
down under 2.75 *et seg*.—*Yukta*—applying himself with diligence.

‘*Chandāṃsi*’— the Vedas. The term ‘*chandas*’ here stands for the Veda,
and not for the metres, *Gāyatrī* and the rest. Hence this same rule
applies also to the case of those who are studying the *prose-Brāhmaṇas*
(and is not restricted to those studying the metrical *saṃhitā* texts
only). It is only right that the rule should be so applicable, as both
(prose and metrical portions) are equally regarded as ‘Veda.’ In this
connection, the option referred to has been restricted to the extent
that the students of the Sāma-Veda perform the ‘Upākarma’ on the
full-moon day of *Bhādrapada*, while those of the Ṛgveda and the
Yajurveda do it on that of *Śrāvaṇa*—(95)
