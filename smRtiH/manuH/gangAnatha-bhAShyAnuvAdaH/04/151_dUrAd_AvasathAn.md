The water with which the feet are washed is called ‘*feet-washing*;’
this he shall throw far away. Or, the washing of the feet itself may be
done far off.

‘*Niṣeka*’ is *throwing*. As a matter of fact, the water used in bathing
after oiling the body, may also be called ‘*niṣeka*’ But what is
forbidden is the throwing of all kinds of *leavings*; as it is this that
is more generally spoken of as ‘*niseka*.’—(151).
