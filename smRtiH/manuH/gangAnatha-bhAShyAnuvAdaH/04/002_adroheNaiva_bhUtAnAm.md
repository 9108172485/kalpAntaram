By ‘*trouble*’ here is meant, not only *harm*, but the unpleasant
feeling or displeasure that is produced in the mind of one who is
constantly begged with the words ‘give me this,’ ‘give me that;’—the
*harming* of others being already generally prohibited.

‘*Little trouble*;’—If he cannot manage to live without begging, he
should beg very little. This is what.is meant by ‘little trouble.’

That ‘*means of livelihood*’—means of subsistence, such as agriculture,
service, and the like—which means does not cause trouble to other
persons,—such a means of subsistence should be taken to.

This is a general advice.

‘*By taking to that means...he should subsist*.’

What is to be done in abnormal times of distress shall be laid down in
Discourse X.

From what is said here it follows that there are also other means of
living than those that are going to be described. Otherwise, if the
present text referred to those only that are going to be described,
there would be no point in the general injunction here put forward. Thus
it is that we get at such means of living as ‘officiating at
sacrifices,’ ‘teaching,’ ‘money-lending,’ and so forth,—even though
these are not mentioned among ‘*amṛta*’ and the rest enumerated here.

‘Living on gleanings,’ which has been accepted as a very small means of
subsistence, is what is meant by ‘involving little trouble.’ Says
Gautama (10.6)—‘Agriculture and Trade, done through others, as also
money-lending.’

What is here laid down is the means of mere subsistence; the amassing of
wealth is to be done by the few specialised means going to be
enumerated.—(2)
