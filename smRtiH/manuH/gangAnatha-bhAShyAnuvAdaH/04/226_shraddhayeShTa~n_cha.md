‘*Iṣṭa*,’ ‘*sacrifice*,’ stands for those acts of Sacrifice and the like
that are done on a regular altar; while ‘*pūrta*’ stands for other acts
done with a view to spiritual results, such as honouring those who
deserve to be honoured, and so forth.

Both these sets of acts shall be done ‘*with faith*;’ and *with
well-gotten wealth*;’—*i.e*., with wealth got by such fair means as
learning, bravery, bride, and so forth.

Thus performed, these acts lead to ini perishable results. Those that
are performed with wealth not well-gotten, are not fruitless; they only
lead to perishable (transitory) results. Because, even unfair means
produce *ownership*; so that sacrifices may be performed with wealth
over which one’s ownership has been produced. Further, *usury* (as a
means of acquiring wealth) is not found to have been prohibited anywhere
in connection with sacrifices and charities. Hence it follows that, even
with the help of such wealth, sacrifices, etc., shall be performed till
Heaven has been attained. There will certainly be some difference in the
degr.ee of excellence in the results obtained.

Now, the question arises—What are the *fair* sources of acquiring
wealth?

In answer to this, we have the following verses:—

I. *What is derived from* (*a*) *learning*, (*b*) *bravery*, (*c*)
*austerities*, (*d*) *bride*, (*e*) *person sacrificed for*, (*f*)
*pupil, and* (g) *inheritance,—are the seven kinds of ‘pure*’ *wealth;
and the result of these is also pure*.

> Of these, *learning* and *austerities* are the sources that bring
> presents. Though ‘present’ constitutes only one kind of wealth, yet it
> has been mentioned as *two*, on account of its twofold source. The
> qualifications of the persons making the gifts have also to be borne
> in mind. If the giver does not happen to be absolutely objectionable,
> the wealth derived from him is also *pure*.—The terms ‘*person
> sacrificed for*’ and ‘*pupil*’ indicate the work of *officiating at
> sacrifices* and *teaching*.—‘*inherited*,’ from one’s
> forefathers.—‘*Bride*,’ what is obtained from the Father-in-law, at
> the time of marriage.—‘*Bravery*’— for the *Kṣatriya*; while the
> ‘bride’ and ‘inheritance,’ are common to all men.

II\. *What is derived by*— (*a*) *usury*—(*b*) *agriculture*, (*c*)
*trade*, (*d*) *art* (*e*) *service*, (*f*) *attendance*, *and* (*g*)
*from a person who has been helped* ;—*these seven kinds of wealth are
called* ‘*mixed*.’

> ‘*Service*’ consists of running on errands and obeying orders; while
> ‘*attendance*’ is agreeable behaviour. Of these, ‘usury,’
> ‘agriculture’ and ‘trade’ are *mixed* only for the *non* - *Vaiśya*;
> for the *Vaiśya*, these are commendable. Similarly, ‘service,’
> consisting of attending upon twice-born men, is commendable for the
> *Śūdra*; the others are not commended for him. What is meant by these
> being ‘mixed’ is, that the results obtained from acts, performed with
> wealth derived from those sources, are transitory; these results
> lasting only during the present life.

III\. *What is obtained by*—(*a*) *bribery*, (*b*) *gambling*, (*c*)
*stealing*, (*d*) *causing pain to others*, (*e*) *hypocrisy*, (*f*)
*robbery and* (*g*) *fraud*;—*all this has been declared to be ‘black*.’

> ‘*Pārśvika*,’—the man at one’s side, obtains wealth by means of
> bribery, etc. For instance, having come to know that a person is going
> to obtain some wealth, one goes over to him and says, ‘I shall get yon
> so much wealth, you should give me something out of it,’ and then
> receives it from him; the man not having done anything himself, nor
> having anything done by others, but simply looking on, and yet
> receiving money; or when one receives some consideration for standing
> surety for a borrower.—‘*Pratirūpaka*’ is pretence, hypocrisy
> .—‘*Fraud*’—when one sells the *kusumbha* flower, in place of
> saffron.—‘*Ārti*’ is causing pain to others.—‘*Stealing*’ is taking
> away things by stealth; and ‘*robbery*’ is taking away by force.

“As a matter of fact, stealing and robbery do not produce *ownership* at
all, these not having been mentioned, among the means of acquiring it,
in Gautama 10.39—‘One becomes an owner by inheritance, purchase,
partition, presents and trade;’ or, in Manu (10.116)—‘Learning, Art,
Service,’ etc; or, again, Manu (10.115)—‘Seven sources of wealth are
legal, etc.’ If it be argued that these same assertions indicate Theft
and Robbery also as sources of wealth—then, what would be the meaning of
the assertion—‘What is eaten by force, cannot be digested.’”

Some people offer the following explanation:—‘*Dyūta-cauryārti*’
(Gambling, Theft, Causing pain to others) is not the right reading; the
right reading being ‘*vairyārti*’ (enmity, causing pain). At the time of
making peace with an enemy, one says, ‘I shall make peace with yon only
if you give me so much;’ and the other party, being helpless, gives what
is asked for,—The term, *sāhasa*, does not stand for *robbery*, but for
*rashness*; when, for instance, one earns wealth even at the risk of
one’s life; *e.g*., by going on boats, or by selling things prohibited
by the king.

Others, however, opine as follows:—‘Ownership’ by robbery is not
incompatible with the assertion regarding ‘not digesting;’ because force
is employed only at the first act of snatching, and, after that, even
when there is no force used, and the wealth is obtained and enjoyed
merely by the indifference of the other party, there does come about
actual *ownership* And, as for the assertion that it is not digested,
this refers to the case where voilence (violence?) is used from
beginning to end. Thus there is no incompatability between the two.

The right view on this point is as follows:—Real ownership is not
brought about by Theft and Robbery, because of the different reading
suggested; and also because other Smṛti-writers have not mentioned these
among the.means of acquiring weath.—(226)
