‘*Sensual objects*.’— Objects of sense, colour, taste, and the rest; —
‘*to these he shall not become addicted*,’—*i.e*., he shall not attend
to them too much. Lovely young girls, sounds of flute and music, sweet
taste, perfumes of camphor and other things, loving touch,—all these one
shall not enjoy over much.

‘*Through desire*’—*i.e*., by reason of the predominating influence of
desire.

In regard to all these, one should keep one’s own enjoyment under proper
check; just in the same manner as one keeps one’s desire for wealth
under check, by. restricting one’s earning? only to what one gets
without begging.

‘*Excessive addiction to these*.’—This points out the method of
restraining one’s desires. Attachment to objects cannot be checked by
the mind; it can be checked by reflecting upon them as inimical to one’s
best interests. At first, one should not seek to obtain them; and when
they do come to one, and one has enjoyed them once, one should reflect
upon the following facts relating to them:—These are such that in a
moment they cease to be agreeable,—they are transient,—they are
forbidden by the scriptures,—attachment to them leads to hell, and so
forth. This is what has been already said under 2.96 above.—(16)
