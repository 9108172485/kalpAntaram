To his enemy, he shall not send presents,—he shall not sit or stand in
the same place with him,—he shall not go home in his company,—he shall
not carry on conversation with him, and so forth.

‘*Unrighteous person*,’—a sinner, *i.e*., one who maintains himself by
bad livelihood.

‘*Thief*’—one who steals things. It is this separate mention of the
‘thief’ which implies that *all*‘ unrighteous’ persons are not meant to
be avoided, but only those mentioned above (those living by evil ways of
living).

‘*The lady of another person*.’—The use of the term ‘*lady*’ (‘*yoṣit*’)
and not ‘wife’ (‘*pat??*’) is meant to show that one shall avoid, not
only the married wife, but also the ‘kept’ woman; because paying
attention to both equally leads to enmity; and the present prohibition
is based upon visible (ordinary worldly) considerations. In the next
verse, we have the term ‘*wife*,’ (‘*dārā*’), which is meant to indicate
the excessive spiritual wrong involved. It would not be right to assert
that—“the general term ‘lady’ in the present verse is restricted in its
extension by the term ‘wife’ in the next verse, which is supplementary
to this one.” Because, as a matter of fact, the next is *not*
supplementary to the present verse, which stands distinct by
itself.—(133)
