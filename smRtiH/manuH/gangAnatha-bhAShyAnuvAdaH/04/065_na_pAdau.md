In a broken vessel—even in one that may be broken in a single place;—the
use of one that is broken all over would be forbidden by its very

feel satisfied; or that which is defiled by name—such as ‘*patadgraha*,’
‘spittoon,’ and the like, in the case of these latter also, the mind
does not feel satisfied.—(65)
