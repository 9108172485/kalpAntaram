Having perfomed the ‘Utsarga’-rite, he shall not read the Veda for two
days and one night; *i.e*. during *^(‘)that same day and night*,’ and
during the next *day* only (not the *night*). During this time, ‘*he
shall cease’—i.e*., not read the Veda.

The night, along with the preceding and the following days, is called
‘*the night with its two wings*.’

Or, the day on which the ‘Utsarga’ rite has been performed, that day and
the same night are ‘holidays;’ and on the next day the study should be
resumed.

According to the former explanation, the next day is an ‘holiday,’ and
study is to be resumed on the second night.’—(97)
