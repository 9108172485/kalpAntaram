This verse deprecates begging.

‘*All that is dependent on others is painful*;’—to say nothing of
attending at his gates, following in his wake, and wandering about here
and there (all which is involved in the act of begging). It has been
said that—‘the very idea of begging, the heart cannot bear,—it is
doubtless the greatest illusion; it is not a creation of the self-born
Creator.’

‘*In short*’—briefly. Pain is briefly defined as ‘begging,’ and Pleasure
as ‘absence of want’—(‘60)
