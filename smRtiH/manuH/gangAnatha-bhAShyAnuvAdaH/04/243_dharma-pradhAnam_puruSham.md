‘*Dharmapradhānam*’—means ‘he for whom Duly is the main consideration’;
*i.e*., he who is devoted to duty, and perforins all acts exactly as
they are enjoined.

‘*Who has his sins destroyed by austerities*.’—If he happens to commit
any transgressions, through carelessness, his sin is destroyed by the
expiatory austerities he performs. The evil having arisen out of his
transgression of the law, it is effaced by the proper expiatory rites.

‘*It carries him to the brighter regions above*,’—*i.e*., the effulgent
regions of the gods, in the shape of Heaven, etc.

Who carries him?

*Dharma*, or Spiritual Merit. That this is so, is clear from the
context.

‘*Clothed in his own body*.’—The Soul being in *its own body*, and not
in the body made up of material substances, as ordinary souls are, his
body is his own spiritual one; which means that he is us all-pervading
us Brahman, the Supreme Spirit.—(243)
