When he performs an austerity, he shall not boast of it,—‘I have
performed a most severe austerity, extremely difficult to perform;’ he
shall not entertain any such idea.

‘*Having performed a sacrifice, he shall not utter a lie*.’—Though
*lying* in general has been forbidden, in connection with what is
desirable for men, yet it is forbidden again, with a view to indicate
that the avoidance of untruth is an essential factor in sacrifices also;
and that, if there is a transgression of this, the performance of the
*Jyotiṣṭoma*, etc., would become defective.

‘*Tormented*’— by the Brāhmaṇas—‘*he shall not revile*’—abuse, speak ill
of—them.

‘*Having bestowed a gift*’— in the form of the cow and such other
things,—‘*he shall not advertise it*’ before another person, saying,
‘Such and such a gift has been bestowed by me.’—(236)
