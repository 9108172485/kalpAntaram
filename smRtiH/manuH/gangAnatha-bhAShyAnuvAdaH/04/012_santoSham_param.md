With a view to laying stress upon the importance of the two means of
living—‘to collect grains for three days’ and ‘not to possess grains
enough for the morrow,’—the author adds this verse by way of reflection.

One should have recourse to contentment; that is, one should not make an
effort to go about begging on a large scale, with a view to becoming
dependent upon several persons.

‘*He who wants happiness should remain
self-controlled*.’—‘*Self-control*’ consists in not wanting more wealth
than what would suffice for bare subsistence.

‘Contentment’ is the root of happiness for all high-minded persons; and
its opposite—*i.e*., Discontent—is the root of unhappiness; the
non-accomplishment of what is desired being a source of great
humiliation for the learned. For these reasons, one should have recourse
to contentment.—(12)
