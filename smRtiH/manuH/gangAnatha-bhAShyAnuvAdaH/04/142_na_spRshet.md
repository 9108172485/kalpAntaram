‘*Unclean*;’—*i.e*., not washed after having eaten; or, after having
evacuated the bladder or the bowels. The term ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’ here stands
simply for ‘*impure*;’ and it is in this sense that the ‘*ucchiṣṭa*’
person is forbidden to touch the cow, etc. The expiatory rite in
connection with this forbidden touching is going to be prescribed in the
next verse, where the term ‘*ashuchi*,’ ‘impure,’ is used.

No significance attaches to the term ‘*hand*’, as touching with any
other part of the body also is not desirable. The prohibition, however,
does not apply to the case where one interposes a piece of cloth.

‘*He shall not look at the luminaries in the sky*.’—‘*Being in* *good*
*health’—i.e*., under normal conditions.—The addition of the pharse
(phrase?), ‘*in the sky*,’ indicates that the prohibition does not apply
to looking at the ‘luminary *on the earth*’—*i.e*., the fire.—(142)
