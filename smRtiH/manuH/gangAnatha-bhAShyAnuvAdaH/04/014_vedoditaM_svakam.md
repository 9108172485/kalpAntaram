‘*Prescribed in the Veda*.’—This is said in view of the fact that the
Smṛtis are all based upon the Veda.

‘*His own duty*.’—Consisting of the host of observances going to be
described. Being prescribed for him, they are called ‘*his own*.’

‘*Should always perform*.’—*i e*., as long as he lives.

‘*Without sloth*’—*i.e*., free from laziness.

By doing this—*i.e*., by keeping the observances,—‘*to the best of his
ability*;’—this implies that one is to perform just what he has the
strength to perform. It is in view of this that it has been declared
that—‘one may also observe all this mentally only.’

‘*Highest state*’—*i.e*., attainment of Brahman.—(14)
