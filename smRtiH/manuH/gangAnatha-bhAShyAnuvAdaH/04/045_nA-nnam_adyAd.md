Even though the man always wears his sacred thread (and hence, correctly
speaking, he is never with only one piece of cloth on), yet, since the
sacred thread is always on the body and it does not cover any part of
the body, and since the present injunction is apart from the section
dealing with Upanayana (where the wearing of the sacred thread is
prescribed),—he is regarded as ‘*having only one piece of cloth on
himself*.’ What the text means is that, at the time of eating, he shall
have on his body a second piece of cloth capable of covering his body.

‘*He shall not pass urine*.’—‘Urine’ here stands for excretions of all
kinds.

‘*Pathi*’—on the road.

‘*On the haunts of cows*’—the path by which cows pass, or the place
where they go to graze.—(45)
