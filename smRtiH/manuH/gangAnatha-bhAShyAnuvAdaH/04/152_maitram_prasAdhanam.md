Among Vedic passages describing the limbs of animals, the excretory
organ is called ‘*Mitra*;’ taking the term ‘*Mitra*’ in the same sense
here also, its derivative ‘*maitra*’ is taken to mean the ‘clearing of
the excretory organ’.

‘*Toilette*’—dressing of the hair, painting, and so forth. Or, the two
terms ‘*maitram*’ and ‘*prasādhanam*’ may be construed together, as noun
and adjective, which would mean that, even without passing any faeces,
one should wash his excretory organ, just as the washing of the mouth
after sleep has been prescribed as necessary, in view of the fact that,
during sleep, saliva is sure to flow out; similarly, even in

the absence of any direct reason, it is necessary to wash the mouth as
also the lower limbs of the body.

Others explain that ‘*maitra*’ means ‘the act of a *maitra*, friend the
*friendly act*; and what the text means is that ‘friendly acts should be
done before all other, even the most entimately necessary, acts but the
precedence to be given is only over the acts that one may do for his own
benefit, and *not* those that have to be done for the sake of
cleanliness. In this case, the term ‘*forenoon*’ would mean only
*precedence over the other acts*, and not the *exclusion of the
afternoon*.

Or again, ‘Mitra’ may stand for the sun; and ‘*Maitra*’ in that case
would mean ‘the worshipping of the Sun.’—(152)
