On the sun having set; the accusative ending in ‘*astam*’ is in
accordance with Pāṇini 1. 4. 90.

‘*Nor go anywhere*, *etc*.’—“This has already been forbidden in the
section dealing with the duties of the Student; where it has been also
explained that the prohibition pertains to the men in general, and is
not restricted to the Student only.”

act as an ‘observance;’ and what is meant is that ‘One should make a
life-long determination of not going about with mouth unwashed after
meals.’—(75)
