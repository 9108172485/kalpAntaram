‘*Who* *acts resolutely*,’—*i. e*., he who is firm in his determination
to do something; having undertaken an act, he is sure to finish it;
having begun an act, he does not desist: *i.e*., who is not
undetermined. This is what is asserted in such passages as—‘going to the
end of what has been begun, etc., etc.’

‘*Gentle*’—not hard-hearted.

‘*Has no connection with men of cruel conduct*’—such as thieves and
others.

‘*By means o f self-control and liberality*, *he wins heaven*’— ‘*if he
sticks to this practice*;’—*i.e*., observing the said rules.

‘*Self-control*’ being mentioned separately, the term, ‘*dāntaḥ*,’
should he taken to mean ‘tolerant of opposition.’—(246)
