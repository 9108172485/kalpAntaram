It has been said above that he should recite and offer oblations; and
now he states the means of doing the *reciting*.—‘*He shall recite the
Veda*’ The rest of the verse is purely commendatory.

‘*Whenever he finds time*’—the *Avyayībhāva* compound ‘*yathākālam*’
signifying *repetition*. The meaning is that ‘whenever the man happens
to be free from, all. worldly activity, he should recite the Veda.’ The
other duties—such as the performance of the *Agnihotra* and the
like—have their fixed time; while for *recitation*, *purity* is the only
condition.

This is the ‘*primary duty*;’ all else is ‘*secondary
duty*;’—‘*upadharma*’ means ‘nearly as good as duty.’ This compound,
therefore, is *Tatpuruṣa*, and not *Avyayībhāva*,—according to Pāṇini
2.1.55.

This deprecation of other duties is meant to be a praise of Vedic
recitation, and it is not meant to be a prohibition of those.—(147)
