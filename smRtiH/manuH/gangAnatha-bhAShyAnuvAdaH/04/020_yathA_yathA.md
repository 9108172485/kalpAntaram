‘*Study*’ here stands for *application*, repeated muling.

‘*Under stands*’—*i.e*., when one studies a treatise repeatedly, one
comes to comprehend fully what is contained in it.

‘*Then his knowledge shines forth*’;—*i.e*., becomes bright. This verse
states the reason for the foregoing verse.

The root ‘*ruc*’ governs the Dative only when it is used in the sense of
‘longing for;’ and, as it does not convey that meaning here, we do not
have the Dative.—(20)
