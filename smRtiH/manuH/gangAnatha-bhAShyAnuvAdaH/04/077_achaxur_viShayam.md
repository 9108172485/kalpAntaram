‘*Difficult of access*.’— Mountains and such places as can be got at
with difficulty; as also a forest dense with trees, shrubs and creepers.

‘*He shall not approach*.’—*He* shall not pass over, shall not go to.

‘*Which is not within the range of his vision*;’—because there is danger
of snakes and robbers, etc., lying hidden there. The ‘*Eye*’ includes
also the other sources of knowledge, such as the Scriptures, for
Instance.

‘*Urine and excreta*’—‘Looking at’—these mean examining their colour,
etc. This extends over a long time; and hence should not be done. There
is no harm in seeing it once by the way.

Swimming a river is forbidden for a man in the normal state; and not
when there is danger apprehended from wolves and other animals.—(77)
