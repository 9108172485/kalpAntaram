‘*Beset*’— attacked. One shall not study in a village where many thieves
have come in for attacking.

‘*Alarm*.’—When alarm has been caused by fire—*i.e*., when lire has set
in in a house, even though the house may not be entirely burnt.

‘*Ākālika-anādhyāya*.’—That is, from the time that the trouble appears
up to the same time next day, it is unfit for study.

‘*Also at the appearance of other portents*’—heavenly, earthly and
atmospheric; *e.g*., the floating of stones, stars visible during the
day, and so forth.—(118)
