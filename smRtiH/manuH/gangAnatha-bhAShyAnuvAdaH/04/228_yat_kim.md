‘*Something*’—however little—shall be given by one who is ‘*asked*,’
begged. If there is some doubt,—and no certainty—as to the person being
a worthy or unworthy recipient, some little thing, not much, should be
given. The idea, that much shall not be given, is due to a direct
assertion to that effect, in connection with doubtful cases.

It is just possible that the man may turn out to be a worthy
recipient;—What sort of recipient?—‘*One who will save him from*’—guard
him against—‘*everything*’—all kinds of Sin that lead men to hell.

It has been said under 3.96 that gifts are to be offered to ‘one who
knows the Veda and its meaning;’ and to that the present verse is an
exception, providing for small gifts being offered in cases of doubtful
worthiness of the recipient.—(228)
