... *Answer*:—The term has been added for the purpose of laying stress
upon the fact that those persons are meant who still keep up their study
of the Veda.

‘*Householders*.’—This does not mean that the mendicant, the ascetic and
the student are not to be honoured; all that is meant is that, since all
these live upon *alms*, they cannot be regarded as ‘guests;’ especially
as the student cannot dwell anywhere else except at his teacher’s house,
and the ascetic cannot dwell away from the forests. For the Renunciate
also, dwelling in villages is not possible, since it has been distinctly
declared that ‘he shall go to the village only when seeking for alms’
(Gautama, 3. 14). From all this it follows that, in view of the fact
that persons in the other stages of life live in places other than
‘households,’—even though it be somehow possible for them to have the
character of ‘guests,’—what is said here can apply to *householders*
only, *as a rule*.

‘*With offerings to Gods, and to Pitṛs*.’—That is, these persons are to
be received and honoured at the performance of rites in honour of Gods
and of Pitṛs.

‘*Otherwise*.’—Those who are not ‘accomplished,’ should be avoided, even
though they be free from the aforesaid defects (described in 30).—(31)
