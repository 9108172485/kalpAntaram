There is a distinctive badge connected with each of the life-stages. For
the Student there is the wearing of the girdle-zone, etc.; for the
Householder, there is the wearing of the bamboo-stick, the ear-ring, the
water-pot, and so forth; and for the Wandering Recluse, the wearing of
the reddish-brown garment, the rod, and so forth.

How, if a Householder makes a living—by wearing one of of these badges,
with a view to obtaining alms,—‘*he takes of the sins of persons
entitled to that badge*;’—helps them to become free from their debts;
and ‘*is born in the womb of a lower animal*,’ such as the jackal and
the like.

In this connection, the difficulty should not be raised that it is not
possible for the sins committed by the persons entitled to the badge to
move away from them to go over to the pretender.

Because all that is meant by the text is that one should not wear the
badge of other persons. Even though no direct prohibition is laid down,
yet we deduce the said impropriety from the deprecatory statement
contained in the verse.—(200)
