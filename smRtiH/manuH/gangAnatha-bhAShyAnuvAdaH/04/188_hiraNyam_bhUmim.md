The text states the evil results following from the illiterate man
accepting the gift of certain specified things.—‘He becomes reduced to
ashes, like wood;’—just as wood, on being burnt by fire, becomes reduced
to ashes, so the Brāhmaṇa, who is not endowed with proper learning,
becomes reduced to ashes, by accepting the gift of gold and other things
mentioned here.—(188).
