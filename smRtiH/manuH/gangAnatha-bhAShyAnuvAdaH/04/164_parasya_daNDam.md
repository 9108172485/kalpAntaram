‘*Daṇḍa*,’ ‘rod,’ is that whereby one *is struck*, ‘*daṇḍyate*;’ that
is, the hand, the stick, the whip, the rope, the split-bamboo, and so
forth.—This ‘*rod*’ ‘*he shall not raise, when angry, against another
person*;’ *i.e*., he shall not hold it up; nor shall he let it fall
down; *i.e*., bring it into contact with the other person’s body.

The son and the pupil one may strike with the whip, the split-bamboo, or
the slap,—as is going to be mentioned under Discourse VIII,—but not with
the *stick*. Further, these two are to be beaten, not in auger, but only
*with a view to correction*,’—*i.e*., for the purpose of correcting
them, if through boyishness, they happen to misbehave. And these two are
to be punished lightly, as is going to be laid down under 8.299.

The ‘*pupil*’ is meant to exclude the male and female slaves also; the
purpose served (*i*. *e*., correction) being the same in both
cases—(164).
