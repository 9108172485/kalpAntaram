‘*Dancing*’—Throwing about of the limbs in a particular manner, as is
well known among people.

‘*Singing*’—is the producing of sound in the ‘*Ṣadja*’ and other notes
of music. What is forbidden here is ordinary *temporal*, not *Vedic*,
singing; the latter being actually enjoined.

‘*Musical instruments*’—such as, the lute, the flute, the drum, and so
forth. What is forbidden is the man himself playing upon these; and not
making other people play upon them; as there is nothing to justify the
construing of the verb ‘*vādayet*’ as containing a two-fold causal affix
‘*ṇich*’—which alone could afford the meaning of ‘making to play.’

‘*Clapping*’—the sound made by the clapping of the hands, or by striking
the ground with the hand, and so forth.

‘*Grinding o* *f* *teeth*’—the indistinct sound made by the teeth is
what is known by the name of ‘*Kṣveḍanika*.’

If the man happens to be satisfied with anpther person, he shall not
create enmity with him. The prohibition does not apply to the case where
the man is harassed by the other person. The term ‘*virodhayet*’ is to
be explained as ‘*virodham*’ (this noun being found by the addition of
the nominal affix ‘*ghan* (?)’) ‘*kuryāt*’ (this being the connotation
of the ‘*ṇich*’ affix).—(64)
