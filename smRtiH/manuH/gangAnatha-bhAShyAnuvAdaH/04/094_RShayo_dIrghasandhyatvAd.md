The Author proceeds to show for what purpose the aforesaid act has been
prescribed. The meaning is that if one desires such rewards as long life
and so forth, he should perform the twilight-devotions for a long time.
Though the act is an obligatory one, yet the said rewards follow from
prolonging it.

This prolongation is possible only for one who is either without Fires,
or is away from home. As for others (*e.g*., the man with the Fires
living at home), the prolongation of the Twilight-Devotions would
inpinge upon the time laid down for the Agnihotra-offerings.

The twilight devotion is called ‘*prolonged*,’ only figuratively; the
term ‘twilight devotion’ standing for the reciting of Mantras, etc.,
that is done in connection with the said devotion.

The compound ‘*dīrghasandhyā*’ is a *Bahuvrīhi*.

The mention of the sages is by way of a commendatory statement—(94)
