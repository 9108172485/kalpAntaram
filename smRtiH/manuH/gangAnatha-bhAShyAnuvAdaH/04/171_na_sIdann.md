‘*Dharma*,’ ‘Right,’ consists in the bounds of propriety laid down in
the scriptures;—one who acts according to this,—even though he may
‘suffer’ failure—‘*shall not turn his mind towards unrighteousness*.’
Because, even though unrighteous men may be found to have become rich by
wealth acquired by bribery, hypocrisy, and the like,—yet very soon their
‘*overthrow*’—in the form of destruction of their wealth, etc.—is found
to come about. Consequently, one should never deviate from the right.

The Author has, in a friendly spirit, shown us a visible instance.—(171)
