It should not be understood that the scripture here lays down the fact
of Trade being both ‘true’ and ‘false;’ it only describes the nature of
the thing; and what constitutes the ‘falsehood’ of Trade is the element
of avaricious grabbing involved in it.

‘*May live*.’—This implies that Trade may be had recourse to, only for
the purposes of livelihood, never for that of accumulating wealth.

‘*Service is the living* *of* *the dog*.’—The dog is made to work hard,
and gets little and with difficulty; so also the servant. ‘*Service*’
here connotes being *ordered about*; the servant is always commanded to
do this and that work, right as well as wrong. Hence, when people serve
kings with such superior kind of work as the carrying of arms and the
like, these are not regarded ‘as the living of dogs,’—(6)
