If he happen to fail in some attempt at acquiring wealth, he shall not,
at once, have recourse to methods permitted during abnormal times; on
the contrary, he should try again and again; this is what has been said

withered for want of grain, he should not, merely for this, at once have
recourse to living upon others, or to begging.

So long as he can, and so long as he has property, torn and dirty
clothes shall not be worn.—(34)
