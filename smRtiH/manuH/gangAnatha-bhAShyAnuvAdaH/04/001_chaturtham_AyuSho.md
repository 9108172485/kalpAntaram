The first verse sums up in brief what has gone in the last two
discourses, for the purpose of recalling it to the mind; and the second
verse serves to indicate that among the Duties of the Householder this
prescribes the means of livelihood.

Inasmuch as the extent of ‘life’ of man is uncertain, any rule regarding
the ‘quarter’ of life becomes incompatible; hence the present verse is
to be taken as stating only the period of life that has been allocated
to the various stages of life. Though the rule might somehow be
justified on the basis of the assertion that ‘man lives for a hundred
years,’ yet our Author has himself laid down other kinds of limit;
*e.g*., with regard to studentship he has said that ‘it may extend till
the Veda has been got up’ (3. 1); and in connection with the limit of
the stage of the Householder also, it has been said (6. 2)—‘when the
Householder finds etc.;’ and from all this it follows that the present
verse is to be taken simply as the reiteration of the said limits.

‘*The first quarter of his life*.’—This is regarded as ‘first,’ counting
from the man’s birth.

‘*Having dwelt with his Teacher*,’—*i.e*., having accomplished his
studentship;—‘*during the second quarter of his life*,’—he shall marry,
and ‘*live in his house*’;—*i.e*., lead the life of the Householder.—(1)
