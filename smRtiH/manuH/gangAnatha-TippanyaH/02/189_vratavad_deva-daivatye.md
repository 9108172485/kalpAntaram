‘*Ṛṣivat*’—‘Like an ascetic; *i.e*. avoiding honey, meat and other
forbidden food’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘eating only a little
wild-growing rice and other food fit for the ascetic’ (Govindarāja,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

*Medhātithi* (p. 163, l. 17)—‘*Mṛtasya kartṛtvam*’—This refers to
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 10. 2. 55-56. The *Sarvasvāra*, a modification of the
*Jyotiṣṭoma* sacrifice, has been prescribed for by one who desires his
own death; and in course of this the sacrificer surrounds the Post with
a new piece of cloth and having addressed the words—‘O Brāhmaṇas, please
complete this sacrifce of mine,’—enters the fire. In connection with
this it is argued that the performer of the sacrifice having perished,
there can be no point in proceeding with it. But the final conclusion is
that the sacrifice must be proceeded with to its very end, as the
sacrifice as well as its *completion* is directly enjoined by the
*Śruti* text,—the latter by the words laid down as to be addressed to
the Brāhmaṇas.

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 424);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 291), which explains
the construction as ‘*ubhyarthitaḥ kāmamaśnīyāt, abhyarthitaḥ* meaning
‘requested,’ ‘invited’.

Buhler in his translation has omitted the sentence *vratamasya na
lupyate*,
