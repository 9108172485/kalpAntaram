This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 936);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 454), which latter adds that in the event of the Teacher not
being near at hand, the food is to be offered to the Teacher’s wife or
son, or to his own companions,—in *Aparārka* (p. 60);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 61), which explains ‘*Amāyayā*’ as that he should
not conceal the better quality of food obtained - out of fear that the
Teacher will take it for himself;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
113).
