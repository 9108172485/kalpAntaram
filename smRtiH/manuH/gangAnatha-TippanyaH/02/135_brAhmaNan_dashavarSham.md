This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 474), as showing
that the Brāhmaṇa is ‘superior’ to all.

It quotes the same verse as contained in *Bhaviṣyapurāṇa*.—. It is
quoted also in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 44b);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 101) to the effect that as between a
*Brāhmaṇa* and a *Kṣatriya*, the former is to be saluted by the latter,
even though he be very much junior in age.
