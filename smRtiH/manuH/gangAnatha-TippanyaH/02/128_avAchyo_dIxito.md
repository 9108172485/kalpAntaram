This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 466), where the
following explanation is added:—At the time of returning the salutation,
the person initiated for a sacrifice even though he be younger in age,
should not be addressed by name, after the performance of the *Dīkṣaṇīyā
Iṣṭi*, the Initiatory Sacrifice, till the completion of the Final Bath
of the *Avabhṛtha*; he should be addressed by such words as ‘*Dīkṣita*’
and the like, following after the syllable ‘*bhoḥ*’ or ‘*bhavat*—*i. e*.
‘*bho dīkṣita*’.

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 28) in support of the view
that even in the return greeting, the name of the initiate should not be
pronounced; and is explained to mean that the initiate should be
addressed with such words as ‘*bho dīkṣita* or ‘*bhavān dīkṣita*, or
some such other expressions containing a synonym of the word
‘*dīkṣita*’.
