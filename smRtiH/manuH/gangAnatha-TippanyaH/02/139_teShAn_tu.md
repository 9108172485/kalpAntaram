This verse also is simply quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
477);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 107) to the effect that among
the persons mentioned in the preceding verse the accomplished student
and the king deserve to be respected by the others’, and between these
two the former is to be respected by the latter.
