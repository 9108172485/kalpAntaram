‘*Maitraḥ*’—‘of friendly disposition (towards all living
beings)’—Medhātithi;—‘worshipper of Mitra, Sun’ (suggested by
Rāghavāṇanda).

‘*Brāhmaṇaḥ*’—‘one who will be absorbed in Brahman’ (Kullūka);—‘the best
of Brāhmaṇas’ (Rāghavānanda);—

Buhler remarks—“Medhātithi and Govindarāja take the last clause
differently: it is declared (in the Veda that) a Brāhmaṇa (shall be) a
friend (of all creatures).” But in Medhātithi we find no mention of the
Veda here.

The verse is clearly meant to be deprecatory of Animal-sacrifices, which
involve the killing of animals, whereas the Brāhmaṇa should be friendly
to all creatures.

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṃgraha* (p. 127).
