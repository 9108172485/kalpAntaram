‘*Vedaḥ kṛtsnaḥ*’—‘One whole *śākhā*, including the Mantra and the
Brāhmaṇa texts’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘The Veda with
the Aṅgas’ (‘others’ quoted by Medhātithi, and Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Rahasya*’—‘Upaniṣads’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, and
Nandana);—‘Esoteric explanations of the Veda’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Tapoviśeṣa*’—‘Fasting, *Kṛcchra* and the rest’ (Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa
and Nandana);—‘the rules laid down for the observances of Students’
(‘others’ quoted by Medhātithi Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘Particular
observances, such as feeding the horse while reading the Aśvamedha
texts’ (Rāghavānanda).

‘*Vrata*’—“The Mahānāmni and the rest; see *Śāṅkhāyana* Gṛhyasūtra I.
11-13”—Buhler.

*Medhātithi*—(P. 149, 1. 16)—*Graham sammārṣṭi*’—See Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 2. 1.
9; and 3. 1. 13.

*Ibid* (pp. 149—150)—‘*Avokīrṇiprāyaścittam*’—prescribed in Manu 11.
118-120.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 505), where it is
explained that though the adjective ‘*kṛtsnaḥ*,’ ‘entire,’ qualifies
‘*Veda*’, yet what is meant is one *entire śākhā* of the Veda, and not
*all the śākhās* of a Veda; and hence the upshot is that the entire
*śākhā* of a Veda should be studied by one who has been sanctified by
the sacraments prescribed in the *Gṛḥyasūtra* of that *śākhā* to which
his forefathers belonged.

*Medhātithi* (P. 152, 1. 1)—‘*Satyapi vedatve?*—On p. 140, 1. 3,
Medhātithi has given a somewhat different explanation of the separate
mention of ‘*Rahasya?*

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 76), which explains
‘*adhigantavyaḥ*’ to mean that ‘the verbal text as well as the meaning
*should be studied*,’—‘*vrataiḥ*’ as ‘the observances, the avoiding of
honey, meat, perfumes, garland and the like;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 132), which explains ‘*rahasya*’ as ‘Upaniṣad’ and
‘*adhigantavyaḥ*’ as ‘should be studied
