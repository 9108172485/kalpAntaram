This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 26) with the following
notes:—The term ‘*bhoḥ*’ is the ‘*marūpabhāva*’ of names; *i.e*. it
leads the name uttered to reach the person addressed; the sense being
that when addressed with the term ‘*bhoḥ*’, the person catches the
saluter’s name. The root in the term ‘*bhāva*’ denotes *reaching*. If we
read ‘*bhobhāvaḥ*’ this would mean ‘the *bhāva*, or presence, of the
term *bhoḥ*:

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450) where we have the
following notes:—At the end of the name pronounced in the salutation,
one should utter the term ‘*bhoḥ*’ for attracting the attention of the
person saluted; because it has been declared by the sages that the term
‘*bhoḥ*’ stands for the names of the persons addressed; so that, even
though the name of the saluted person be not uttered, the term ‘*bhoḥ*’
becomes the proper form of address. Thus then the formula for saluting
comes to be ‘*abhivādaye amukanāma ahamasmi bhoḥ*.’

This is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 191);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 45), which states the complete formula as ‘*Ābhivādaye Devadatto’ham
bho*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 96).
