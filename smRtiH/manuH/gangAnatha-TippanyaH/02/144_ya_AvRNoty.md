title = "144 य आवृणोत्य्"

+++
This verse, along with verse 114, occurs in an older form (as Burnell
remarks) in the Viṣṇu and Vaśiṣṭha Smṛtis; and also in *Nirukta* II. 4,
where the verb appears as ‘*ātṛṇatti*’.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 93), which explains
‘*āvṛṇoti*’ as ‘fill’, and ‘*avitatham*’ as ‘free from wrong
accentuation and other defects’.
