This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 515), among texts
laying down the Teacher’s duties;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 523), as
mentioning those who should not be taught;—in *Madanapārjāta* (p. 103)
as mentioning certain persons not fit for teaching;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 51);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 312), which explains the meaning to
be that ‘there is no merit in teaching a heretic who neglects the
prescribed duties’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 140).
