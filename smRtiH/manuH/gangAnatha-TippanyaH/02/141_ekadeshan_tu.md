This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 304), as defining
the *Upādhyāya*, the Sub-teacher, in view of the declaration that the
‘*Ācārya*’ is equal to ten ‘*Upādhyāyas*’;—also in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 477), which adds the following notes—‘*Ekadeśam*’—*i.e*.
either the Brāhmaṇa portion alone, or the Mantra-portion
alone;—‘*Vṛttyartham*’—for his own livelihood.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 30) having quoted the verse adds—*Ekadeśam*—of the
Veda, *i.e*. either the *Saṃhitā*, or the *Brāhmaṇa* or subsidiary
sciences;—he who teaches any *one* of those either *without payment*,—or
with payment (without previously stipulating for it),—is an
‘*Upādhyāya*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 65), as providing the definition of
*Upādhyāya*;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 45);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 91), which explains ‘*vṛtti*’ as *living*.
