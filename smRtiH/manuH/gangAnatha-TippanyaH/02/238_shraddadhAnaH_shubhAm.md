‘*Param dharmam*’—‘Special law, *i*. *e*., law other than that expounded
in the *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*; *i.e*., that relating to ordinary worldly
matters’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Rāghavānanda);—‘the means of
obtaining final liberation’ (Kullūka), which view is noted and rejected
by Medhātithi.

‘*Duṣkulādapi*’—‘Family wanting in the due perfohnance of religious
acts’ (Medhātitlii);—‘Family lower than one’s own’ (Kullūka);—‘Family of
a potter or such other low castes’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 514) in support of
the view that learning may be acquired even from persons of lower
grades;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 144);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 52).
