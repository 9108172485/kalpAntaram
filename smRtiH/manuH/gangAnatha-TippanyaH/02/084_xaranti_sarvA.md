‘*Kṣaranti*’—‘Pass away—do not bring about their complete results, or
their results disappear quickly’—(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘Perish—as far as their form and results are
concerned’—(Nandana).

‘*Brahma*’—The neuter form is accepted by Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda. Nārāyaṇa and Nandana read the masculine form
‘*brahmā*’, and explain the phrase as ‘just like Brahmā, the Prajāpati.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Ācāra, p. 321), where it is
explained that—‘*akṣaram*’ stands for the *syllable* ‘*om*’,—and this is
‘akṣara’ in the sense that its effect in the form Final Release ‘never
perishes’ (*na-kṣarati*);—and that the syllable ‘*om*’ is to be regarded
as ‘Prajāpati’ on the ground of its being expressive of that deity. Here
again this same verse is attributed to Yama also.

Medhātithi’s remarks on p. 115,11. 1-8 are based upon Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra 1.
4. 17-22.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 79), which reads
‘*Akṣaram śreṣṭham*’ for ‘*duṣkaram jñeyam*’ and explains it as
‘*Brahma-praṇava*.’
