title = "216 कामन् तु"

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 30l), as laying
down how, in view of the foregoing text, the young student is to behave
towards the Teacher’s wife;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462),
which remarks that the term ‘*yuvā*’, ‘young man,’ in this verse makes
it clear that the mention of ‘twenty years’ in verse 212 is meant to
stand for youth in general;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 47) as laying down
the necessity of saluting the Teacher’s wives;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 104).
