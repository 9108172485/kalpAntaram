*Pūjayet*—‘worship’ (Govindarāja and Nandana.);—Medhātithi offers three
explanations as to what is meant by the ‘worshipping’ of the
food;—Nārāyaṇa takes it to mean that the *mantra* (Ṛgveda, 1. 187.1)
should be addressed to it Kullūka explains it as ‘meditate upon it as
sustaining life’.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
486), which explains the *pūjā* as standing for saṃskāra, *due
preparation*.

It is quoted again in the *Āhnika* section of the same work (p. 382),
where, on the strength of a statement attributed to Śātātapa, it is said
that in the case of food, ‘worship’ can only mean being *regarded as a
deity*.

The verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 433);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 114), which explains ‘*akutsayan*’ as ‘not decrying.’
