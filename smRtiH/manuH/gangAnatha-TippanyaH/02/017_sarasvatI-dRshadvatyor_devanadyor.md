The Aparārka quotes this verse along with verses 19,21 to 23, as
indicating the views that the ‘black antelope’ is to serve as a mark of
the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ only in the case of the countries *other than those
described in these verses*. This verse and verses 18 to 22 have been
quoted in the *Madanapārijāta* (p. 12) in support of the view that the
‘Custom’ or ‘Right Behaviour’ that is to be regarded as authoritative
and trustworthy is that prevalent among the people inhabiting the tract
of land herein defined.

Other writers, among whom are Vaśiṣṭha and Śaṅkha define ‘*Āryāvarta*’
as that tract ‘where the black antelope roams’; which, according to Manu
(2.23) is the characteristic feature of the ‘*yajñīya deśa*’ ‘land fit
for sacrificial acts’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 27),—in the *Vīramitrodaya*
(Paribhāṣā, p. 55), which explains that the epithet ‘*devanirūpitam*,’
‘created by the Gods,’ is only meant to be eulogistic;—in the
*Dānamayūkha* (p. 7),—and in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4).
