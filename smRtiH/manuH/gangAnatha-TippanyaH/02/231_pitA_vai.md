“For the arrangement of these three fires, see the plan at the end of
the first volume of Haig’s Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, and that at page 191 of
Hillebrandt’s *Das Altindische Neu-und Vollmondsopfer*. These fires are
on circular, semi-circular and square altars respectively. For the same
comparisons, otherwise employed, see Āpastamba,
2.7.2.”—(Burnell—Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Prāyascittaviveka* (p. 128);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 95).
