This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 447);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 22),—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 436);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 930), which last points out that the copulative
compound ‘*bailvapālaśau*’ should not be taken to imply that two staves
have to be taken up; because later on, in verse 48, we have the singular
form ‘*daṇḍam*’;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 189), and *Aparārka* (p. 57);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra p. 43b);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
77), which adds that the text lays down optional alternatives;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 37), which adds that a combination of all the
staves is not meant, only one staff being held, as is clear from the
singular number in the next verse; they are to be taken as optional
alternatives;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 193), which, along with
*Mayūkha* reads ‘*paippala*’ or ‘*pailava*,’ and adds that option is
clearly meant.
