‘*Ūrjam*’.—Buhler wrongly attributes to Medhātithi the explanation that
this term means ‘bulk’. The term used by him is ‘*mahāprāṇatā*’ which
means the same as ‘*vīrya*’ of Kullūka or ‘energy’ of Nārāyaṇa. Buhler
has apparently been misled by a mis-reading of Medhātithi.

This verse has been quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 486) where
‘*pūjitam*’ has been explained as, ‘*samskṛtam*’, well prepared;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 114).
