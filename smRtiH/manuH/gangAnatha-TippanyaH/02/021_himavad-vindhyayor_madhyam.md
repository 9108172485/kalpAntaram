‘*Vināśana*’—This is the name given to the place where the river
Sarasvatī becomes lost in the sands. Buhler says it lies in the district
of Hissar, in the Punjab.

Buhler curiously translates ‘*pratyak*’ by ‘east,’ while it means
*west*.

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (p. 18), which explains
‘*vinaśana*’ as the place where the Sarasvatī has disappeared;—in the
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣa, p. 56) which locates ‘Vinaśana’ in the
*Kurukṣetra*,—in the *Dānamayūkha*, (p. 7),—and the *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 4).
