This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 438) as
laying down the *Avakīrṇivrata* (actually prescribed in 11.118 in
connection with the loss of chastity on the part of the Student) as
applicable to other omissions also;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p.
485), in support of the view that the Begging of Alms is not optional,
but compulsory, since the present verse prescribes an expiation for its
omission, which clearly implies that the omission is sinful;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498) to the effect that the omission of Begging
alms involves sin; and again on page 500, where it is explained that the
expiation here prescribed is to be performed in the event of repeated
omissions;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 1345, on 3. 281), where it is
explained as laying down an expiation for those cases where the duty of
‘fire-tending’ is omitted without any such extenuating circumstance as
being occupied with some other duty.

*Nirṇayosindhu* (p. 190) quotes it as laying down the expiatory rites
due on the omission of the duties laid down for the Student.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1142) as laying down the expiation for
omitting the said duties, without sufficient reason;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 111) to the effect that alms-begging is an obligatory
duty;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 357).
