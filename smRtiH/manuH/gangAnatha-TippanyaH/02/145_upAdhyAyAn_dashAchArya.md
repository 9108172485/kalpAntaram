The first quarter of this is referred to in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
304).

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 31);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 478), where the following notes are added:—In point of
veneration, the ‘*Ācārya*’ is superior as compared to ten
‘*Upādhyāyas*’, the Father is superior to a hundred *Ācāryas*, and the
Mother is superior to a thousand Fathers;—the person spoken of as
*ācārya* here is the person who performs the *Upanayana* and teaches the
*Sāvtrī* only (not the entire Veda),—as is clear from the next verse
where the man who performs the *Upanayana* and teaches the entire Veda
is described as superior to the Father.

This same explanation is given by Medhātithi and Kullūka also.
Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa on the other hand, hold that the word ‘*Pitā*’,
‘Father’, stands for that Father who, having begotten the child,
performs its *Upanayana* and himself teaches it the entire Veda.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 92), which adds
that the Father meant here is one who is a mere Progenitor and has not
performed any sacramental rites for the boy; in other eases, when he
*has* performed these, it is the Father that is superior.
