This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 567) in support of
the view that no ‘fee’ is to paid to the Teacher before the *completion*
of study; and it adds that this ‘Concluding Bath’ is for the purpose of
entering the married state,—and not for that of any other
life-stage;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 179), which adds that
this refers to the presenting of a *living*, there being no prohibition
regarding other kinds of presents.
