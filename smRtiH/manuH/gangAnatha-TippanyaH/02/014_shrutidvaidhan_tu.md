This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 15) as
describing the comparative authority of the several sources. Where there
are two Vedic texts setting forth two conflicting views, both are to be
accepted, since they have been so accepted by authorities older than
Manu himself, *i. e*. the two are to be regarded as optional
alternatives.

It is quoted also in the *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda (Saṃskāra*, p. 136.)
