This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āḥnika, p. 321), which supplies
the following explanatory notes:—

‘*Vāyubhūtaḥ*’—as quick- moving as the wind, or ‘encased in the Subtle
Body’—as explained in *Kalpataru*;—‘*Khamūrtimān*’—becoming as
all-pervading as the *Ākāśa*, becomes the Supreme Self.,

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 286) as eulogising the
*japa* of the *Gāyatrī mantra*;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 236).
