*Medhātithi* (P. 114, 1. 12)—‘*Āpastamba vacanāt*’—This refers to
Āpastamba’s Dharmasūtra 1.4.13.9, the whole of which reads as follows—

> *loke ca bhūtikarmasvetadīnyeca vākyāni syuryathā pupyāhaṃ
> svassyṛddhimiti*

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 321), where the same
verse is attributed to Yama also.
