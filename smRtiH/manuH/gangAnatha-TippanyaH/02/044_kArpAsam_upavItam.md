This verse is quoted in *Smṛtichandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 80), Which says
that ‘*trivṛt*’ means ‘made of nine yarns’;—and in *Nityāchārapradīpa*
(p. 31).

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 448); in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 21),—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 414);—also in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 190);—in *Aparārka* (p. 58);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 43a);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 38), which has the
following notes:—‘*ūrdhvavṛtam*’ and ‘*trivṛt*’ are to be construed with
‘*śaṇasūtramayam*’; also,—‘*āvikam*’ means ‘of sheep- *wool*.’

‘*Urdhvavṛtam*’—This is thus defined by ‘*Saṅgrahākāra*.’ a writer
quoted in Parāśaramādhava and Madanapārijāta—‘That which is twisted
threefold by the right hand moving upward’—*i.e*. twisted towards the
right.

‘*Trivṛt*’—has been explained in *Vīramitrodaya* as standing for
‘consisting of *nine* threads’; and thus on the basis of a *Śruti* text
which defines ‘*Trivṛt*’ as *nine*. The same explanation is given in
*Aparārka* also;—so also *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 6.)
