This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 178), which adds
that what is meant is that if possible, the best articles should be
presented;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 368), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Kṣetram*,’ field with corns standing,—the umbrella and shoes,
should both go together, such being the sense of the
compounding,—‘*Vāsāṃsi*’ *three* pieces of cloth,—‘*gurave
prītimāvahan*,’ the ‘completion of the study should be done only when
the Teacher permits it’;—also in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 48a).
