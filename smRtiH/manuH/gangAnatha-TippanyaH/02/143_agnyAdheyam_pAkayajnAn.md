This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (H, p. 5) as supporting the
view that the title ‘*Ṛtvik*’ is applicable to the man from the moment
of ‘appointment’ till the end of the performance of the rites for which
he has been appointed; and that during this time any impurity attaching
to the man would be only ‘immediate’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 91) as defining the *Ṛtvik'*

It is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477) where
‘*agnyādhāyam*’ is explained as *agnyādhānam*, and ‘*Pākayajña'* as *the
Aṣṭaka and the rest*;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 31);—and in *Aparārka* (p.
66) as meaning that the title ‘Ṛtvik’ applies to that man whose services
are paid for by a sacrificer for the performance of the sacrificial
rite;—and again on p. 919.
