This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 455), where it is
explained that the ‘left’ and ‘right’ of the second half stand for the
left and right *feet*; so that the meaning is that the left foot of the
teacher should be touched by the left hand and the right one by the
right hand; and it quotes Baudhāyann laying down that the pupil should
pass his hands from the knee downwards to the foot.

A similar explanation is given also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
300).

The verse is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 52.1);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 55), as laying down the ‘feet clasping’ of the teacher;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 40), which says that ‘*spraṣṭavyaḥ*’ goes with
‘*gurucaraṇaḥ*’ understood;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 103),
which explains the meaning to be that the left and right feet of the
teacher are to be touched with the left and right hands respectively.
