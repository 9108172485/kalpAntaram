This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450), where the
following explanation is added:—The meaning is that the man who does not
know the return greeting in strict consonance with rules of salutation
does not deserve to be greeted at all, the correct form of the response
being as laid down in the preceding verse—the ultra-elongation of the
vowel at the end of the name pronounced by the saluter in the formula of
salutation. What is prohibited here is only that salutation which is
accompanied by the formula containing the saluter’s name; that all
salutation is not entirely interdicted is indicated by the words ‘he is
exactly as the Śūdra is’;—the Śūdra also, when over ninety years of age,
is deserving of salutation, according to Manu 2. 137. The word
‘*pratyabhivādanam*’ means the pronouncing, by the elder who has been
saluted, of benediction with prescribed formula.

This verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 28), which adds a
verse from Yama to the effect that the Brāhmaṇa who, on being saluted,
does not return the proper benediction, is born as a tree in the
crematorium, inhabited by crows and vultures.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 297) as laying down that no
salutation should be offered to one ignorant of the proper form of the
response to it;—in *Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 407);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 57);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 98).
