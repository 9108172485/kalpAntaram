‘*Vaidikaiḥ karmabhiḥ*’.—The term ‘*vaidika-karma*’ here stands for
*Vedic mantras*;—or for rites prescribed in the Veda. Both explanations
are found in Medhātithi and Govindarāja; Kullūka notes only the latter
explanation.

This verse has been quoted in the *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 132) as
laying down the necessity of performing the *Saṃskāras*. Here also both
the above explanations are noted.—It explains the term ‘*śarīra*’ in the
compound ‘*Śarīrasaṃskāraḥ*’ to stand for the *constituents of the
body*.—‘*In this world and also after death*’—has been explained as
implying that the Saṃskāras help ‘after death’ by enabling the man to
perform such sacrifices as lead him to heaven, and they help ‘in this
world’ by enabling him to perform such sacrifices as the *Kārīrī* and
the like, which bring desirable results in the world, in the shape of
rain, children and so forth.—It is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 36), to the effect that sacramental rites are performed
with Vedic Mantras in the ease of the *Twice-bom* persons only; it adds
that these sacraments are called ‘*pāvana*’, ‘purificatory’ of the
person, because, performed with Vedic Mantras, they serve to destroy
sins.
