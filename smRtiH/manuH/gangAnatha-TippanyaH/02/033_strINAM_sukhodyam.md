This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 441), which cites
the typical female name ‘*Śrīdāsī*.’

This is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 631).

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 243) quotes the verse, and having
explained the words, cites as examples—‘*Yaśodā*’ (easily pronouncible)
‘*Kulaghnī*’ (harsh)—‘*Indirā*’ (not of plain meaning)—‘*Kamahīyā*’
(heart-captivating)—‘*Subhadrā*’ (auspicious)—and ‘*Saubhāgyavatī*’
(containing a benedictory term).

*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 310) simply quotes the verse;—and *Aparārka* (p.
27) quotes it as laying down rules regarding the first part of female
names.

This is quoted in *Smṛti candrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 55), which adds the
following notes—‘*sukhodyam*,’ easily pronouncible,—‘*maṅgalyam*’
denoting auspiciousness;—‘*dīrghavarṇa*, the long ī. or ā.
