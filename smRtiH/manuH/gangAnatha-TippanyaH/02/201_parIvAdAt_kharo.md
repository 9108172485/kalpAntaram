‘*Paribhoktā*’—‘He who lives upon the Teacher’ (Medhātithi);—‘he who
eats, without the Teacher’s permission, the best food obtained by
begging’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

The verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107) where ‘*paribhoktā*’ is
explained as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s wealth, without his
permission’;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), which also
explains ‘*paribhoktā*’ as ‘one who lives upon the Teacher’s property,
without his permission.’

*Medhātithi* (P. 169,1. 16)—‘*Samskartā...ghātakaḥ*’—This is a clear
reference to Manu 5.51—

> anumantā viśasitā nihantā krayavikrayī \|  
> saṃskartā copahartā ca khādakaśceti ghātakāḥ \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 42), which explains
‘*paribhoktā*’ as one who eats food without presenting it to the
Teacher;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120) as forbidding the
decrying of the Teacher by the Pupil himself; it explains ‘*paribhoktā*’
as ‘one who makes use of the Teacher’s property without his permission.’
