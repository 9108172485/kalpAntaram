Hopkins is not quite accurate in his interjectory remark—“So the *twice*
-born has *three* births!” It is not every twice-born person that has
three births; the third ‘birth’ belongs to only that twice-born person
who is initiated for a sacrifice. Hopkins might as well exclaim in
connection with the next verse—“So the twice-born has two mothers and
two fathers!”
