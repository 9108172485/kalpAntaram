This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kālasāra, p. 217);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 53) to the effect that the names of the
four castes should consist of words expressive respectively, of welfare,
strength, wealth and deprecation;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra p.
346);—and in *Saṃskāra-mayūkha* (p. 25).

Burnell—‘This is now obsolete. The names of the different castes are now
usually epithets or titles of some favourite deity. The caste is known
only by the suffixed title.’

This verse has been quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskā ra, p. 242), where
we have the following explanations: ‘*maṅgalyam*’ means *expressive* of
*auspiciousness*; e.g., the name ‘*Lakṣmīdhara*’;—‘*Balānvitam*’ means
*expressive of bravery*, e.g., the name
‘*Yudhiṣṭhira*;’—‘*dhanasamyuktam*’, means *containing terms expressive
of wealth*; e.g., the name ‘*Mahādhana*’;—‘*jugupsitam*’ means
*containing a term denoting depreciation*; e.g., the name ‘*Naradāsa*’.

*Madanapārijāta* also quotes this verse (on p. 357), where it is
explained to mean that ‘the names should be expressive of auspiciousness
and the rest’

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 441) quotes it as also the four typical
names as—‘*Śrī Śarmā*’ ‘*Vikramapālo*’, *Māṇikyaśreṣṭhi and
Hīnadāsa*;—it is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 27) as laying down rules
regarding the first part of the name.
