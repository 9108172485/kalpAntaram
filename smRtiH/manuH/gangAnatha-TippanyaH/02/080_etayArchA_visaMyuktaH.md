The text of this verse, and hence its meaning, is entirely changed in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 429); the words as quoted here are,

> *etayar??'pi saṃyuktaḥ kāle?a kriyayā'mu?ā* \|  
> *?ipra?triya?i?yonirprāha?ya?ṃ yāti prādhuṣu* \|\|

it may be rendered thus—‘Equipped with this verse, and timely
performance of this act, a person of Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya birth
becomes acceptable among the good.’
