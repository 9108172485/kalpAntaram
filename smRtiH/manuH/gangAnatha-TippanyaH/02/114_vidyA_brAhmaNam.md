This verse is an adaptation of a very much older text. *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 515) quotes this latter text as ‘śruti’—

> vidyā ha vai brāhmaṇamājagām  
> gopāya māṃ śevadhiṣṭe'hamasmi \|  
> asūyakāyānṛjave apatāya  
> nā mām brūyāt avīryavatī tathā syām \|\|

Burnell and Hopkins remark as follows:—“This with verse 144, which
appears to have originally followed these verses as a whole, constitutes
a favourite saying of the Brāhmaṇas. These verses in an older form are
quoted in the Nirukta (ii-4), and (more like this present text) they
occur also in the *Viṣṇu* and *Vaśiṣṭha Smṛtis* s they also occur in
*Saṃhitopaniṣad-brāhmaṇa* of the Sāmaveda (pp. 29-30). The older form of
these two verses 114 and 115 (as well as 144) was in the *Tṛṣṭup* metre,
as in the Smṛtis just referred to.”

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 103)—where the Amarakoṣa is
quoted as explaining ‘*Śevadhi*’ as ‘*nidhi*,’ ‘treasure and ‘*asūyā*’
is defined as ‘tendency to fault-finding.’

It is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 523).
