‘*Vihāyasi*’—In the air, *i*. *e*. on the roof of the house (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘on a platform’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘in the open air
(Nandana);—‘in any pure place except the ground’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 451), as laying
down the method of ‘tending the fire’, and ‘explains it that ‘he should
place the fuel somewhere in the open, not on the grouhd;’—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 936) as laying down the morning and evening offerings
into the Fire;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 448), where ‘*dūrāt*’ is
explained as from a spot not owned by any one’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p.
498), where *vihāyasi* is explained as ‘*antarīkṣe*’ ‘in the open air—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 24), where ‘*dūrāt*’ is explained as ‘from a spot
not owned by any other person’, and ‘*vihāyasi*’ as ‘*maṇḍapādau*’ ‘oh
an altar or some such place’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 43), which says
that, according to *Dharmaprakāśa*, ‘*vihāyasi*’ means ‘on the
house-top’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 86), which explains
*dūrāt*, as ‘from places not belonging to any person’, and *vihāyasi* as
‘on the house-top’,—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 34a).
