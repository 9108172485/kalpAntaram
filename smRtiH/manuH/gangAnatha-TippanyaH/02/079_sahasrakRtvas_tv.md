‘*Vahiḥ*’—Burnell represents Medhātithi as explaining this term to be
‘on a river-island and the like.’ This is not right; the word used by
Medhātithi is ‘*nadīpulinādau*’—which means ‘on the *bank* of rivers and
such places’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1220) where ‘*vahiḥ*’ is
explained as ‘outside the village’—and ‘*trikam*’ as ‘the Sāvitrī along
with the Vyāhṛtis’;—and in *Gadādharapaddhai* (Kālasāra, p. 30), which
explains ‘*trikam*’ as (1) *Praṇava*. (2) *Vyāhṛti* and (3) *Gāyatrī*.
