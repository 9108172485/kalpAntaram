‘*Vihāyasi*’—In the air, *i.e.* on the roof of the house (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘on a platform’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘in the open air
(Nandana);—‘in any pure place except the ground’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 451), as laying
down the method of ‘tending the fire’, and ‘explains it that ‘he should
place the fuel somewhere in the open, not on the grouhd;’—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 936) as laying down the morning and evening offerings
into the Fire;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 448), where ‘*dūrāt*’ is
explained as from a spot not owned
