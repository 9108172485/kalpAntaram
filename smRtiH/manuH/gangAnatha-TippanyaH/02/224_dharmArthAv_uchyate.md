Hopkins remarks “*four* schools are noted but he ignores the fifth,—the
Siddhānta—‘*trivargamiti tu sthitiḥ*’ ‘the truth is that it is the
aggregate of the three.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 158), which adds that *Dharma*,
*Artha* and *Kāma* are the ‘group of three’;—this constitutes the
‘*Śreyaḥ*’, which one should constantly bear in mind as the aim to be
attained.
