This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 458) in support of
the view that the mother-in-law should be accosted with the clasping of
her feet, whereby the prohibition of clasping of the feet of the
mother-in-law, met with in some Smṛtis, has to be taken as referring to
eases where the mother-in-law happens to be a youthful woman,—under
which circumstances the Teacher’s wife also should not be clasped in the
feet.
