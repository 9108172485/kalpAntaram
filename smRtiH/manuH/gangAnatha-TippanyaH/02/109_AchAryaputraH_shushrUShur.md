‘*Dharmataḥ*’—‘According to the sacred law’ (Kullūka and Nandana);—‘for
the sake of merit’ (Medhātithi, Govindarājā and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 517) as laying
down the duties of the Teacher;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 51);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 812);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 140)
which explains ‘*śaktaḥ*’ as ‘capable of acquiring knowledge’ and
‘*jñānadaḥ*’ as ‘one who has imparted knowledge.’

*Medhātithi* (p. 125, 1. 22)—‘*Upādhyāyastu*’—This ‘*Upādhyāya*’ is
referred to several times. He is either Medhātithi’s teacher, or an
older commentator on Manu. The former is more probable.
