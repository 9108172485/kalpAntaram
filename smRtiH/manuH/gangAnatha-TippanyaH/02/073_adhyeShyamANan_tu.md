Nārāyaṇa and Nandana read ‘*adhyeṣyamāṇastu gurum etc*,’ which
means—‘the pupil, proceeding to study, shall say to his Teacher etc.,
etc.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 136), where the
verse is explained to mean that—‘each day at the beginning of the
teaching, the Teacher should begin the work with the word ‘*Ho! read*;’
and at the end, should finish with the words ‘*Let there he a stop*;’
and it adds that all this is to be done for the purpose of ‘pleasing
God.’

The verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 100);—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 521);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 514);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 52);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 142),
which explains *ārame* as ‘should desist from teaching.’
