‘*Vedāntopagatam*’—‘*Vedānta*’ stands for the Upaniṣads, and the
‘reward’ is Final Release (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—it stands for the ‘doctrines of the Veda’, and ‘reward’
stands for the results accruing from the sacrifices and rites prescribed
in the Veda (Medhātithi).

*Medhātithi* (P. 140, l. 26)—‘*Kratupuruṣobhayadharmatā*’—Details
prescribed in the Veda have been grouped under three heads—(1)
*puruṣārtha*, (2) *kratvartha* and (3) *kratupuruṣobhayārtha*.

\(1\) The *Darśapūrṇamāsa* sacrifices belong to the *puruṣārtha* class,
as they accomplish something agreeable and desirable for the agent;—

\(2\) all material substances and their purifications and preparations
are *kratvartha*, as they are directly helpful in the accomplishment of
the sacrifice;—

\(3\) certain things come under both categories; e.g. *Curd* is
mentioned in one place simply as a substance to be offered, where it is
only *kratvartha*; while in another place, it is mentioned as the
substance to be offered for the sake of one who desires efficient
sense-organs, in which case it becomes *puruṣārtha*. (See *Prābhākara
Mīmāṃsā*, pp. 197-199).
