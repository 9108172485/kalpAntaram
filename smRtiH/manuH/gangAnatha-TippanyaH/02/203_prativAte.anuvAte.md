title = "203 प्रतिवाते ऽनुवाते"

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 461), where
‘*prativāte*’ is explained as ‘that place to which wind reaches from the
place where the Teacher is sitting’;—*Anuvāte*’ as ‘that place from
where wind blows towards the Teacher’;—at neither of these places should
the Student sit;—‘*Asaṃśrava*’ is that place from where anything spoken
is not heard by the Teacher,—sitting in such a place, he should not say
anything addressed to the Teacher.

This verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107), where the
following notes are added:—‘*Prativāta*’ is ‘wind that blows from the
teacher towards the pupil’; at such a place the Student shall not sit;
as there is the danger of the fire of the teacher’s anger issuing forth
that way;—‘*Anuvāta*’ is wind blowing from the pupil towards the
teacher; there also he shall not sit; as he is likely not to hear the
words of the teacher;—‘*asambhave*’ means *unless permitted by him*.
