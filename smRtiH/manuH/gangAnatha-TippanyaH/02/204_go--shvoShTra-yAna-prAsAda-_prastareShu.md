This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462) where ‘*phalakam*’ is explained as
*Kāṣṭhanirmitam dīrghāsanam*, ‘a long seat made of wood’, a bench:—also
on page 491, where it is quoted in support of the view that the
prohibition contained in verse 198 must refer to cases other than those
of carts and conveyances. It further adds that though the riding on
conveyances drawn by ox etc. is prohibited,—yet the sanction accorded
here is in view of the possibility of such lading in abnormal times of
distress. It is interesting to note that no such scruples have
prejudiced Medhātithi, who apparently belonged to a part of the country
where riding on bullock-carts is permissible; while the author of
*Vīramitrodaya* belonged to a part of the country where such riding is
prohibited, e.g. in Mithilā.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120) as sanctioning, in
certain cases, the sitting of the pupil with the teacher.
