For the apparent inconsistency between this and the preceding verse, see
*note* above.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305), in support of
the view that the ‘*Ācārya*’ also, in certain cases, is superior to the
Father and Mother;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 32), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Brahmajanma*’ means *birth from Veda*, i. e.
*Upanayana*; ‘*after death?*—because it creates in the boy the capacity
to attain all the good, even the Final Release,—as also ‘*here*’—by
reason of creating the capacity to perform all religious rites,—it is
‘*eternally*’—the bringer about of lasting good.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 479) simply quotes the verse.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 97) in support of the view that the
orders of the Teacher carry more weight than those of the Father;—it
explains ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ as ‘the teacher’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 93), which adds that ‘*brahmadaḥ*’ stands for the
*Ācārya*, not the *Upādhyāya*, as is clear from the second line which
means—‘because he gives that *birth which serves the purpose of Vedic
study*, *i.e*. the Upanayana, he is superior.’
