This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 301) as laying down
how the young student is to behave to towards the Teacher’s wife.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
451) as showing that ‘*pādagrahaṇa*’ (clasping of the feet) is distinct
from *abhivādana* (saluting);—and again on p. 462 the entire verse is
quoted along with the preceding verse.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 104).
