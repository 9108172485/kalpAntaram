This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 25);—in *Vidhānapārijāta*
(p. 501);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 296), as mentioning the person
to whom, among a number of people, the salutation is to be offered
first;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 460); where ‘*laukikam*’ is
explained as *arthaśāstrīyādi*, and ‘*ādhyātmikam*’ as
*brahmapratipādakaśāstrīyādi*;—‘*pūrvan*’ as *bahumānyasamavāye
prathamam*;—and it proceeds to point out that among the teachers
enumerated, the succeeding one is to have priority over the preceding
one;—also in *Aparārka* (p. 54) without comment;—and again on p.
142;—also in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 97) as laying down the order
in which salutation has to be offered when there are a number of
Brāhmaṇas assembled;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 44a).
