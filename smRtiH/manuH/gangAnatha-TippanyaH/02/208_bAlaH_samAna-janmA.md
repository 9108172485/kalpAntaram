‘*Yajñakarmaṇi*’—Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa construe this with
‘*śiṣyaḥ*’, and explain the phrase ‘*Yajñakarmaṇi śiṣyaḥ*’ as ‘student
of sacrificial ritual (and other Vedic subsidiaries)’;—Nandana construes
it with ‘*adhyāpayan*’, explaining the phrase as ‘who imparts
instruction in sacrificial ritual—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda take it by
itself, explaining it as ‘who happens to be present *at a sacrificial
performance*’.

‘*Adhyāpayan*’—‘Teaching’ (Medhātithi); ‘Having the capacity to teach’
(Kullūka, also Vīramitrodaya).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462) where
‘*adhyāpayan*’ is explained as ‘capable of teaching’; and the
construction is explained as *yajñakarmaṇi guruvanmānamarhati*’—*i.e*.,
‘at a sacrificial performance, he deserves to be honoured like the
Teacher’;—thus agreeing on all points with the explanation given by
Kullūka.
