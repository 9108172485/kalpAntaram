The first half of the verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
454) in support of the view that the Student should not accept food from
one and the same house day after day; and adds that this is meant to
apply to normal times; in abnormal times it is not meant to be strictly
adhered to; this on the strength of Yājñavalkya’s declaration (1. 32.)

The same work quotes the second half of the verse on p. 485, as
declaring the reward accruing to the Student from strictly following the
rules of alms-begging.

The whole verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 498) as prohibiting
the habit of seeking for food from one and the same person regularly;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 61);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 111),
which says that this refers to *normal* times, not to abnormal times of
distress.
