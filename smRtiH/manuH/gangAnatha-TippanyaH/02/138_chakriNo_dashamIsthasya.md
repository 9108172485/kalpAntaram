This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 76);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 48), which explains ‘*varaḥ*’ as ‘one who is going
to marry’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 107), which has the
following notes—‘*chakrin*,’ one who is driving in a cart,—‘*snātaka*,’
the student who has completed his course of studentship,—‘*varaḥ*,’ one
who is going to marry;—when one meets any of these, he should make way
for him, *i.e*., move away from his path,—among those mentioned here,
the Accomplished Student and the King deserve to be respected by the
‘others’, as stated in the next verse.
