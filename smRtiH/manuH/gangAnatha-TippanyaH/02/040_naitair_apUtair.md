This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 144);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 73), which explains ‘*brahma-sambandha*’
as ‘teaching and so forth,’ and ‘*apūtaiḥ*’ as those who have not
performed the prescribed expiatory rites.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 446);—and also in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 349), which explains the term ‘*apūtaiḥ*’
as ‘those who have not performed the prescribed expiatory rites;’ and
the ‘relationships’ referred are explained as standing for Initiation,
Reading, Teaching, Sacrificing and Receiving gifts.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 68) in support of the view that
dealings *are* permitted with such men as may have performed the
expiatory rites laid down for the omission of the sacraments;—it adds
that this is made clear by the epithet ‘*Apūtaiḥ*’.
