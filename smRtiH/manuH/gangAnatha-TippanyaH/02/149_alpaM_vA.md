‘*Iha*’—‘In these Institutes’ (Kullūka);—‘in the section on salutation’
(Govindarāja). It may also mean, as Buhler rightly suggests, ‘in this
world’.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, as applying the title ‘*guru*’ to
the mere *Upādhyāya* or sub-teacher;—also in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
81);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 477);—in *Aparārka* (p. 65) as
laying down that such a person deserves to be simply *respected*;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 89), to the effect that all that is meant
by such a person being called ‘*guru*’ is that ‘he deserves to be
honoured’, as is indicated by the particle ‘*api*’;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 353);—and in *Prāyaścitta-viveka* (p. 12) in support of the
view that the Father alone is not entitled to be called ‘*guru*’.

*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 303) quotes it as supporting the view that
the name ‘*guru*’ is applied to persons other than the Father only
figuratively or indirectly. To the same effect it is also quoted in the
same work in the Prāyaścitta section (p. 259) as describing the
*secondary ‘guru*’.
