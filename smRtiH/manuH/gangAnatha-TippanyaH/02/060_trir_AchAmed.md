*Medhātithi* (p. 101, l, 21)—‘*Kvachit smaryate*’—Hopkins refers in this
connection to *Mahābhārata* 13.104.39.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 178);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 992), which adds the following notes:—‘*Mukham*,’ the two
lips,—the whole for the part,—the ‘holes’ to be touched also are those
connected with the *face*, *mukha*;—‘*ātmānam*,’ heart or navel,—the
Upaniṣads describing the ‘*ātman*’ as ‘to be seen within the
heart,’—hence the ‘touching’ is to be of the heart, as the ‘Soul,’ being
all-pervading, cannot be touched;—the touching of the *navel* also is
laid down in other texts—\[Hence ‘*ātmānam* may stand for either the
*heart* or the *navel*. \]
