‘*Gurūn*’—‘Superiors, in point of wealth, &c.’ (Medhātithi);—‘those
venerable on account of learning and austerities (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘the husband of a maternal aunt and so forth, but not
those more learned than himself’ (Govindarāja);—‘the teacher and the
rest’ (Nandana);—‘Subteachers’ (Nārāyaṇa).

*Medhātithi* (p. 133, 1. 27)—‘*Gautamīye*’—This refers to Gautama 6.9,
which reads—

> ṛtvikśvaśurapitṛṣyamātulānāṃ tu yavīyasāmprasyutthānamanabhivādyāḥ (?)

*Ibid*. (p. 133, 1. 28)—‘*Bhāgineyādeḥ*’—See Gautama, 6.20—

> vittabandhūkarmajātividyāvayāṃsi para?tīyāṃsi,

*cf*. also Manu, 2.136.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 456), where it is
explained that the term ‘*gurūn*’ stands for those who are possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications.
