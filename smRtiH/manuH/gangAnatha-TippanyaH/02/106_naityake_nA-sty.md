title = "106 नैत्यके नाऽस्त्य्"

“The last clause of verse 106 finds its explanation by the passage from,
the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa quoted by Āpastamba, 1. 12. 3.”—Buhler.

Neither Buhler’s, nor Burnell’s, nor Hopkins’ rendering of the verse is
in keeping with the explanation provided by Medhātithi or Kullūka.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 282) along with 105, as
setting forth an exception to the rules regarding days unfit for
study;—in *Aparārka* (p. 137);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 775).
