This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Pariśeṣa, p. 745);—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kālasāra, p. 220), which explains that “*Upanayana*
is to be derived as ‘*Nayanam evanāyanam*’ and then the prefix ‘*Upa*’
added;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 32);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 68), which adds that in the case of the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya also
the years are to be counted from the one spent in the womb.

It has been quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 17); and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 446).

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 344) explains the reason for the eighth,
eleventh and twelfth years being regarded as the best for the Brāhmaṇa,
the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya respectively. The Gāyatrī mantra is sacred
for the Brāhmaṇa and its foot contains eight syllables; the Triṣtup for
the Kṣatriya contains a foot of eleven syllables, and the Jagati for the
Vaiśya has a foot of twelve syllables.
