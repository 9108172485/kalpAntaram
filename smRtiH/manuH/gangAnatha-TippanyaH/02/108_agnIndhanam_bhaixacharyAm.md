‘Āsamāvartanāt ’—See 3. 3-4.

This verse, is quoted in Parāśaramādhava (Ācāra. p. 455), as laying down
the duties of the Student;—inVīramitrodaya (Saṃskāra, p. 489) as laying
down the ‘ miscellaneous duties ’ of the Student;—and in Aparārka (p.
76), as laying down the time-limit up to which the fire-tending and
other functions have to be kept up.

‘*Acting for the teacher’s well-being*.’ The details of this have been
described by Hārīta, quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 490)—‘By
fetching of water, Kuśa-grass, flowers, fuel, roots, fruits, sweeping
and washing of the house, bodily service and so forth,—he should
devotedly attend upon the Teacher, whose cast off clothes, bed and seat
he should never step over.’

This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 46a);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 118), which adds that those mentioned here
indicate the other duties also.
