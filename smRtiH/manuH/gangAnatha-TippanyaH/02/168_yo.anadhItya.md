This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 510) as declaring
the omission of Vedic study to be sinful; and adds that this text lays
down *directly* the compulsory character of the study, which has been
already *indirectly* indicated by the injunction of the compulsory daily
duties: and the effect of this direct declaration comes to be this that
the omission of the study (as a compulsory duty) involves sin; specially
as for this omission special expiatory rites have been prescribed.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 49) as declaring that there
is sin in the omission of Vedic study, which is a duty duly enjoined. It
is interesting to note however that this assertion has come from the
*Pūrvapakṣin*, and the *Siddhānta* view put forward is that what this
verse is pointing to is only that ante-natal sin which is the cause of
the sloth to which the omission of the study and such other duties is
due; and it is added that what the due performance of the obligatory
duty does is either (1) to maintain the ‘absence of sin’ or (2) to
destroy the said ante-natal sin.

The same work quotes the verse again, on page 140, in support of the
view that Vedic study is an *obligatory* duty.

The same work quotes it again in its Prāyaścitta section (p. 15) as an
instance of what is meant for the *male* only.

The *Madanapārijāta* (p. 102) simply quotes it among a number of other
texts laying down the thorough study of the Veda.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 129) to the effect that
Vedic study should be the very first care of the twice-born.
