‘*Yadveṣṭam maṅgalam kule*’—Medhātithi, along with Govindarāja and
Kullūka, takes this as applicable to all the sacraments.—‘*Kula*’ is
*family*, not *tribe*.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
442), and the second half in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 360) and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 267), which latter remarks that this
option regarding family-custom applies only to the sacrament of the
First Feeding. *The* verse is quoted in

*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, pp. 55 and 57), which adds that the ‘*Gṛha*,’
‘house,’ means the one in which birth has taken place;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kālasāra, p. 218);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 366).
