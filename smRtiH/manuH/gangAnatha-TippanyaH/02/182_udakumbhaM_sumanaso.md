This verse is quoted in *Parāśatramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 394), as
laying down what should be done by the Religious Student, in the event
of a ‘wet dream—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 39);—in *Aparārka* (p. 1141);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 127) as showing that unintentional
emission involves only an expiation;—and in *Prāyoscittaviveka* (p.
462).
