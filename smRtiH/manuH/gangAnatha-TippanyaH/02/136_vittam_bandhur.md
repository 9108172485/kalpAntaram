This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 474), where we
find the following notes:—‘*Vittam*’ stands for *wealth acquired by
lawful* means;—‘*bandhuḥ*’ for *uncles* and others;—‘*vayaḥ*’ for *older
age*;—‘*karma*’ for acts prescribed in the *Śruti* and
*Smṛti*;—‘*vidyā*’ for *true knowledge*;—these are ‘*mānyasthānāni*,’
*i.e. grounds of respectability*. (See note below on 137).

*Aparārka* (p. 159) quotes this verse in support of the view that a man,
though belonging to an inferior caste, deserves to be respected by
another of the superior caste, if the former happens to be possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications.—It is quoted in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 44b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 106), which explains ‘*mānyasthānāni*’ as ‘grounds of respect, and
adds that ‘learning’ is the highest of these all.
