‘*Janavādam*’—‘Quarelling with people’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda);—‘asking people at random for news’ (alternative
suggested by Medhātithi, and Nārāyaṇa).

This is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 456);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 39);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 495);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
42), which notes that ‘*prekṣanālambhana*’ of women is forbidden, lest
they lead on to intercourse;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 125),
which has the same notes and adds that in ordinary crowds and other
places, the *seeing* and *touching* cannot be avoided;—and in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 292), which explains ‘*dyūta*’ as gambling with
dice, and ‘*janavāda*’ as talking of the people in general.
