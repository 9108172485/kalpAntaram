‘*Prajñā*’—‘Wisdom, control over the senses’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
and Rāghavānanda);—‘knowledge of truth’ (Kullūka).

‘*Pādāt*’—This may be taken literally in the sense of *foot*; as Hopkins
rightly remarks—“The hide often is used in oriental countries complete,
each leg being made water-tight.” This is indicated by Medhātithi’s
remarks also.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 493) where the
‘*dṛti*’ is explained as a ‘leathern bag.’ It is quoted to show that
during studentship the strict observance of the vows and restraints is
essential.
