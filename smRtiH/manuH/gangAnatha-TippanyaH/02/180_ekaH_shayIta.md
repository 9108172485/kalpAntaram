This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 39), which explains
‘*Vratam*’ as ‘*brahmacharyam*’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
496);—only the first half in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 456);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 46b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 127), which explains ‘*vratam*’ as the vow of
Studentship;—unintentional emission involves only an expiation, and not
a breach of the vow.
