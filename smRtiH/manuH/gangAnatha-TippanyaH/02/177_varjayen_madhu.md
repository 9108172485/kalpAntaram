‘*Rasān*’—“Molasses and the like’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘clarified butter, oil and the like’ (Nandana);—‘sweet, acid
and the rest;—*i.e*. very richly flavoured food’ (Medhātithi, who also
notes one‘other’ explanation, *juices of sugar-cane, tamarind and other
fruits*, which he rejects);—Nārāyaṇa mentions one explanation, ‘poetic
sentiments’.

This is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 456), along with the next
two verses and a half, as enumerating the things to be avoided by the
Student;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 494), which adds the notes:
‘*Rasān*’ stands for the juices of sugar-cane and other things;—even
though *Honey* also is a juice, yet it has been mentioned separately in
view of the heavier expiatory rites prescribed for the transgressors of
the rule prohibiting it.

The verse is quoted also in *Madanopārjāta* (p. 39) as enumerating the
things prohibited for the Student;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 62);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 42);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 125),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Rasa*’ stands for the sugar-cane juice
and the rest; though ‘*madhu*’ also is a ‘*rasa*,’ yet it is mentioned
separately with a view to indicate that the taking of it involves a
heavier expiation.
