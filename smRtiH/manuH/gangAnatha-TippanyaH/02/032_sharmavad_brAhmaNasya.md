This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 243) also; and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra. p. 55) as laying down the subsidiary titles
of the four caste-names;—also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 309);—and in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 178).

*Parāśaramādḥava* (Ācāra, p. 441) quoting the verse explains it to mean
that ‘*śarman*’ must be the suffixed word to the Brāhmaṇa’s name.

Nārayaṇa and Rāghavānanda opine that the name of the Brāhmaṇa must
always contain the word ‘śarman’ itself. But Medhātithi and several
others hold that the name should connote what is connoted by the term
‘*śarman*.’

The present day practice, however, follows the former
explanation—‘*śarman*’.being regarded now as the suffixed title to every
Brāhmaṇa’s name.
