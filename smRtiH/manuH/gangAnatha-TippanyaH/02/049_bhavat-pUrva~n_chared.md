This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 936); in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
32), which latter adds, the following notes:—

In the phrase ‘*bhaikṣam charet*’ the verb indicates *begging*, as is
shown by the objective term ‘*bhaikṣam*’; it is in view of this that the
expression to be used in the begging is—‘*bhikṣām dehi*’ (‘give
alms’);—and as the words have to be addressed with proper respect, the
term ‘*bhavat*’ with the vocative ending (‘Madam’ or ‘Sir’) has to be
added at the beginning, middle or end, according to the caste of the
begging boy;—then, inasmuch as in the house, it is, as a rule, the
women-folk that give alms, it follows that the feminine-(vocative) form
of the term ‘*bhavat*’ should be used;—thus then the precise form of the
expression comes to be this—(*a*) The Brāhamaṇa boy should say ‘*bhavati
bhikṣām dehi*’, (*b*) the Kṣatriya, ‘*bhikṣām bhavati dehi*,’ and (*c*)
the Vaiśya, ‘*bhikṣām dehi bhavati*’. There is no such hard and fast
rule as that ‘alms should be begged from *women only*.’

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 481) also quotes the verse, and supplies
the formula as noted in *Madanapārijāta*;—*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 60)
quotes it, and lays down the formula for the three castes as—(*a*)
‘*bhavati bhikṣām dadātu*’, (*b*) ‘*bhikṣām bhavatī dadātu*,’ and (*c*)
‘*bhikṣām dadātu bhavati*—*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 108), which
mentions the formula as given in *Madanapārijāta*;—and also
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyāvahāra, p. 124).
