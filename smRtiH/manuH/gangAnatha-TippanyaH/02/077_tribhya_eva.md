Hopkins—“This verse is one of the most famous in literature, Whitney has
discussed it in Vol. I., pp. 111-112 of the new edition of Colebrook’s
Essays. His translation runs as follows—‘Of Savitar, the heavenly, that
longed-for glory may we win, and may himself inspire our prayers.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 52), as
supporting the view that the *gāyatrīmantra*, is ‘born of the Veda’ *par
excellence-*,—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 338).
