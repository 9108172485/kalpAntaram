According to Govindarāja, the rule refers to friends or relatives
meeting, not to every one who returns a salute.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450) in support of
the view that the term ‘*vipraḥ*’ in verse 125 includes the Kṣatriya,
the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also; as it lays down the return-greeting for
all these;—and again on page 465, as a verse common to Manu and Yama and
laying down the benedictory response to salutation.

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 298) as laying down
the return-greetings appropriate for the several castes;—in
*Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 406) as laying down what should be said after
salutation has been returned;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 47);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 100).
