‘*Nideśe tiṣṭhataḥ*’.—‘Standing close by’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka, and Rāghavānanda);—‘standing in a lower place’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 106), where the following
explanation is added:—We have the form ‘*osyetya*’ (which is the reading
adopted by the writer) and ṇot ‘*syaitya*’ because of the Sūtra
‘*mānaśca*’;—‘*praṇamya*’ is to be construed with ‘*nirdeśe* (the
reading adopted by the writer) *tiṣṭhataḥ*’;—‘*nirdeśe*’ meaning *in a
lower place*, or, according to others *in a place close by*;—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 56).
