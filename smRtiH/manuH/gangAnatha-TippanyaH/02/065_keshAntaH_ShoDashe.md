This verse is quoted in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 444);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 778);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 107);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 637), which explains *Dvyadhike* as in the
twenty-fourth year;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 353), which explains
*rājānyabandhuḥ* as *Kṣatriya* and *Dvyadhike* as *twenty-fourth*.

Another name for the *Keśānta* sacrament mentioned in Saṃskāramayūkha is
‘*Godāna*,’ which has been etymologically explained as —*gāvaḥ
keśāḥ-dīyante chidyante yasmin*.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 457), where it is
said that this rite is what is called ‘godāna’;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
67), which adds that the numbers here mentioned are to be counted from
*birth* and not from *conception*, for if the latter were meant, the
word used would have been ‘*garbhaṣoḍaśa*’ like ‘*garbhaṣṭama*.’
