‘*Pākayajñāḥ*’—This term stands for the last four of the five
‘*Mahāyajña*’—

1.  *Brahmayajña* (Vedic study),
2.  *Devayajña* (the Vaiśvadeva offerings),
3.  *Pitṛyajña* (daily Śrāddha offerings),
4.  *Bhūtayajña* (Bali offerings)
5.  and *Manuṣyayajña* (Feeding of guests),

according to Medhātithi, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana.

According to Govindarāja and Rāghvānanda, it stands for all *Śrauta* and
*Smārta* offerings.

The main classification of sacrifices is based upon the difference in
the substances offered. On this basis they have been classified as
under:—

\(l\) *Haviryajñas*, also called ‘Iṣti’, consisting in the offering of
such substances as milk, butter, rice, barley and other grains;—the
principal representatives of this class are (*a*) the *Darśapūrṇamāsa*,
which is described in detail in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (I and II); and
its six ectypes—(*b*) the *Agnyādhāna*, (*c*) the *Agnihotra* (*d*) the
*Āgrahāyaṇeṣṭi* (*e*) the *Cāturmāsya*, (*f*) the *Paśubandha* and (*g*)
the *Sautrāmaṇi*; all these are offered into fire specially consecrated
by the *Agnyādhāna* rite, which serving as it does only the purpose of
preparing the fire for other sacrifices, is not a *sacrifice* in the
strict sense of the term,—as has been remarked by Karka in his
commentary on Kātyāyana’s Śrautasūtra.

\(2\) *Pākayajñas* consisting of the offering of cooked substances, not
in the consecrated fire, but in the domestic fire and other receptacles.
The seven principal sacrifices included under this category are—the five
‘great sacrifices’ (described in *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* 10-5.7 and in
Manu, 3.70), the *Aṣṭakās*, the *Pārvaṇa* offerings, the *Śrāvaṇī*, the
*Āgrahāyaṇī*, the *Caitrī* and the *Āśvāyujī*. These are described in
the *Gṛhya*—not *Śrauta*—Sūtras. Though the substances offered in these
are not very different from those in the Iṣṭis on Haviryajñas, yet they
are classed separately, on the ground that the receptacle of the
offerings in their case is not the consecrated fire.

\(3\) *Somayajñas* in which the substance offered is the Soma-juice; it
includes the following seven sacrifices—(*a*) *Agniṣṭoma*, (*b*)
*Atyagniṣṭoma*, (*c*) *Ukthya*, (*d*) *Śoḍaśin* (*e*) *Vājapeya*, (*f*)
*Atirātra* and (*g*) *Āptoryamā*. Almost all *Somayajñas* involve the
killing of an animal, hence the Animal-sacrifices, Paśuyāgas, have been
included by older writers under this category; though later writers have
drawn a distinction between the *Somayāga* and the *Paśuyāga*. The very
elaborate sacrifices, such as the *Aśvamedha*, the *Rājasūya*, the
*Pauṇḍarīka* and the *Gosava* (according to Devala)—are generally
classed apart, under the generic name of *Mahāyajñakratu*’.
