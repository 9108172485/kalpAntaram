‘*Pavitraiḥ*’—‘Kuśa-blades—by which the seat of the vital airs is
touched’—(Medhātithi);—‘The *Aghamarṣaṇa*’ and other Vedic texts (noted
by Medhātithi, but rejected by him, though adopted by Nandana). Burnell
has translated the term as ‘grass-rings on the third finger’;—this is in
exact conformity with the present usage, where a blade of Kuśa, twisted
into the form of a ring, is worn on the third finger on the occasion of
all religious ceremonies.

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 521);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 522), which explains ‘*prākkūlān*’ as *prāgagrān*
‘pointing eastwards’,—and ‘*pavitraiḥ*’ simply as ‘*pāranaiḥ*’
‘purificatories’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 49), which explains
‘*prākkūlān*’ as ‘with tips pointing towards the east’;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 316) which has the same explanations and adds
that it refers to Kuśa-blades;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 135)
which has the same explanation and explains ‘*pavitraiḥ*’ as
purificatory;—also in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 471).
