‘*Payo dadhi ghṛtam madhu*’—stand respectively for Merit, Wealth,
Pleasure and Final Release, according to Nārāyaṇa and Nandana.
Medhātithi notes this explanation as provided by ‘others.’

*Medhātithi* (p. 124, 1. 15)—‘*Ekasya tūhhayatve*’—This is Mīmāṃsā Sūtra
4. 3. 4. There are two texts—‘makes an offering of curd’ and ‘for the
benefit of one desiring sense-organs, one should sacrifice with curd’;
the question that arises is whether these two texts lay down two
distinct acts, or both conjointly enjoin a single act; and the
conclusion is that the two acts are distinct.

This principle, Medhātithi argues, is not applicable to the present
case; the mention of the four distinct substances cannot he taken as
supplying the motive for four distinct acts.

*Medhātithi* (p. 124,1. 16)—‘*Rātrisatranyāyaḥ*’—This is enunciated in
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 4. 3. 17 *et seq*. In connection with the *Rātrisatra*
sacrifice, it has been held that it is conducive to ‘respectability,’
even though this is a result mentioned in an Arthavāda passage. This
principle also is not applicable to the present case where the necessary
motive is provided by the compulsory character of the act.
