‘*Anūcānaḥ*’—‘Teacher of the Veda’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘he who
has learnt the Veda’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa, Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 305);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 480);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
93), which explains the meaning as, ‘the sages have not laid down the
principle that greatness depends on years and the rest; what they have
asserted is that among us he is great who is the best expounder of the
‘Veda.’

“This verse with the following one is proverbial, and is repeated
several times in the Mahābhārata and the other law-books.”—Hopkins.
