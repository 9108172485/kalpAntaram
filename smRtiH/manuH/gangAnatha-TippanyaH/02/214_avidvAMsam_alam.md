This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 104) as laying
down the reason why the young wife of the Teacher should not be touched
in the feet by the young pupil, the meaning being—‘Because women are
capable of leading the learned as well as the ignorant man, who may
yield to to physical desires and other weaknesses’.
