This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 453) in support of
the view that alms are to be begged only from ‘praiseworthy’ persons;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 381), as laying down the special
qualifications of the Brāhmaṇas from whom the Brāhmaṇa Student is to beg
alms;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 496) in support of the view that even
among people of his own caste, alms should be begged only from the
houses of specially qualified men.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 59);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 60);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p.

288), which adds the following notes:—Those who are not devoid of the
knowledge of one or two or three Vedas,—those who have not omitted to
perform the sacrifices,—and those who are carrying out in a praiseworthy
manner all the duties prescribed for them,—from the house of such
parsons, the Brahmacārī—ha who is keeping the vows for the sake of Vedic
study—keeping all the restraints and observances—should daily obtain
‘alms’—‘*bhaikṣam*’ being a collective noun;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 109).
