‘*Laghuvāsāḥ*’—Lightly cothed,—clothed with washed, and hence light,
dress’ (Medhātithi);—‘with clean clothes (Kullūka);—‘clothed in dress
which is not gorgeous, *i. e*. which is less valuable than the
Teacher’s’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta*, (p. 521); in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 99);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 523), which having adopted
the reading *prā?listu kṛtāpośo* for *???likṛto'dhvāpyo* explains that
the presence of the two words ‘*āchāntaḥ*’ and ‘*kṛtāpośo*’—both of
which denote *ācamana*—makes it clear that the *ācamana* is to be done
twice.

Burnell refers to Ch. XV of *Prātiśākhya* of the Ṛgveda.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (*Saṃskāra*, p. 136), which
notes that this ‘*ācamana*’ forms part of the act of *Reading*;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 50) which has the same note;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 315);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
47a).
