This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 458) in support of
the view that the clasping of the feet of the brother’s wife should be
done when one belongs to the same caste as her husband; and the
prohibition of such clasping met with in some Smṛtis should be taken as
referring to cases where the sister-in-law happens to belong to a lower
caste;—also in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 103).
