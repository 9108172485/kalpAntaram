The tract here described “comprises,”—says Buhler—“the Doab from the
neighbourhood of Delhi as far as Mathura,” and Burnell refers us to a
map in the *Numismata Orientalia*, *Part I*.

This verse is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra P. 17) which reads
‘*Anantaram*’ and explains—it as ‘slightly less important’;—in the
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 56), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Matsya*, *Virātdeśa*,—*Pāñchāla*’ the *Kānyakubja* and adjacent
countries,—*Śūrasena*, country about Mathura,—‘*anantaraḥ*’ slightly
inferior;—in the *Dānamayūkha* (p. 7.) and the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4),
which have the same explanations as the *Vīramitrodaya*.
