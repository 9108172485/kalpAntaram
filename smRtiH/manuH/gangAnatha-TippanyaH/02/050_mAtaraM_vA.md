Burnell remarks that ‘this begging of alms is now obsolete But so far as
the formality is concerned, it is still gone through at the close of the
*Upanayaṇa* ceremony.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 59) as laying down the rule
relating to that alms-begging which is done as part of the
Upanayaṇa-ceremony.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitittva* (p. 936), which adds that these ladies are
to be approached only if they happen to be on the spot, and the boy is
not to go to their houses;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 34), which latter
quotes it only with a view to explain that there is no inconsistency
between this injunction and the later prohibition (2. 184) of begging
from one’s relations; because the former refers to the *begging* as part
of the *Upanayana* ceremony, whereas the prohibition applies to the
usual begging of food during the entire period of studentship.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 61), which adds that this rule
refers to the ‘alms-begging’ which forms part of the Upanayaṇa rite;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 109), which adds the same note;—and in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 288), which has the same remarks, and notes that
the first ‘*vā*’ is meant to be emphatic—‘*nija*’ means
*uterine*,—‘*avamāna*’ means disregard, refusal to give alms.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 483) also explains that this refers to the
first ‘begging’ (at the *Upanayaṇa*),
