This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462) as providing
exception to the general rule of the preceding verse, which declares
that all that is done for the teacher should be done for his son also;
and the present verse specifies certain acts of service which, though
done for the Teacher, are not permissible for the Teacher’s son.
‘*Gātrotsādana*’ means ‘nibbing and shampooing the body.’

It is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 495).
