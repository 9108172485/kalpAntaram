‘*Brahmaṇo mukham*—“Literally, the *mouth of Brahman* is meant to convey
the double sense (of *leading to*, and *leading to union with*,
*Brahman*). Both interpretations are given by Medhātithi, Kullūka. and
Rāghavānanda; while Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana explain it merely
as the *beginning or portal of the Veda*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 71) as defining the
‘*Brahmamukha*’, which has been declared by Nārāyaṇa to be the formula
for the *Ācamana*;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 522), as laying down
the beginning of study;—in the same work again (Āhnika, p. 253), where
it is explained as meaning that the name ‘*sandhyā*’ (Twilight Prayers)
is applied to all those acts that are performed with the formula herein
specified;—also on p. 321, along with the next three verses.

This first line of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 1290).

The verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 50), which explains
‘*tisraḥ*’ as ‘*Bhūḥ-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ*’ and ‘*brahmaṇo mukham*’ as ‘to be
pronounced at the beginning of Vedic reading—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 135), which notes—‘*om bhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥ*’ are the three
*Vyāhṛtis*,—*tatsavituḥ* &c., is the *Sāvitrī*; all this forms the
‘*mukha*’, *i.e*. beginning, of ‘Brahman’, *i.e*. the Veda.
