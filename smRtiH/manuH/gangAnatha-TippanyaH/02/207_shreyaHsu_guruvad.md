‘*Ācārye*’—is construed as qualifying ‘*guruputre*’ according to
Medhātithi, who explains the two terms as ‘the teacher’s son who imparts
instruction for a few days during the absence of the teacher’.—Another
reading, suggested by

Medhātithi is ‘*āryeṣu*’, explained as ‘duly qualified Brāhmaṇas’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Govindarāja);—‘virtuous’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘older in age’ (Vīramitrodaya).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where we
have the following explanations:—‘*Śreyaḥsu*’ means ‘those possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications;—‘*āryeṣu*’ means ‘older in
age’;—‘*guroḥ svabandhuṣu*’ means ‘the teacher’s uncles and other
relations—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).
