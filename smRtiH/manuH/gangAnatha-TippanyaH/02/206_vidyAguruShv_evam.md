This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 462), where
‘*vidyāguru*’ is explained as ‘teachers other than the
*Ācārya*’,—‘*nityā*’, as ‘holding for all time’,—‘*svayoni*’, as ‘uncle
and the rest’,—‘*hita*’ as *dharmatattva*, ‘the essence of
Morality’;—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 34).
