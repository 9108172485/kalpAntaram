This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 930), which adds that in the
event of the specified wood not being available any one of the woods
recommended for the three castes may be used for any one of these
three;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 22);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
436), which last explains ‘*Keśāntikaḥ*’ as ‘*Mūrdhāpramāṇaḥ*’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 448);—in *Aparārka* (p. 57);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.43b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
78), which explains ‘*Keśāntikaḥ*’ as *reaching up to the head*.
