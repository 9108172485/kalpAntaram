‘*Samayādhyuṣite*’;—The dawn (Medhātithi),—or that twilight which comes
after the departure of the night (Ibid, and Govindarāja);—the time when
neither the sun nor the stars are visible (Kullūka).

This verse has been quoted by the *Madanapārijāta* (p. 175) as
indicating the two divisions of the time ‘before sunrise’;—these two
divisions being ‘*Anudita*’ and ‘*Samayādhyuṣita*.’ These two are more
fully described by Kātyāyana, who defines the ‘*anudita*’ as ‘the
sixteenth part of the night, adorned by stars and planets’,—and the
‘*Samayādhyuṣita*’ as that time in the morning when the stars have
disappeared, but the sun has not risen.

The same authority defines the ‘*udita* ‘sunrise,’ as that when the mere
streak of the sun is visible, not all its rays.

It is quoted also in the the *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Ācāra, p. 326);—in the
*Saṃskāraratnamālā*, (p. 2) as laying down the two times for *Homa*, and
it reads ‘*homaḥ*’ for ‘*yajñaḥ*’;—in the *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 65) as
laying down the time for the morning *Homa*;—and in the
*Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 410.)
