‘*Sapiṇḍe*’.—The ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’ is defined below in 5.60.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458) as laying down
the duties of the life-long Student;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 109) in
support of the view that in the absence of the Teacher’s wife, the
Student should take up ‘residence’ with the Teacher’s *Sapiṇḍa*, and in
the absence of this latter also, he should betake himself to the
‘tending of Fire’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 549) to the effect
that ‘residence with Fire’ is to be taken up only in the absence of the
Teacher’s Sapiṇḍa;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504), along with the
following verse;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 76) as referring to the ‘*Life-long*
Student’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 167), which says that
this refers to cases where no *Sapiṇḍa* is available.
