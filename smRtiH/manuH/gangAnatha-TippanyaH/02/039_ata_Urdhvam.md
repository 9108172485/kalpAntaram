This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 446), and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 36), where it is explained that on the expiry of
the limit mentioned in verse 38, the boy becomes a ‘*Vrātya*,’
‘apostate’, and can be invested only after having become sanctified by
the performance of the *Vrātyastoma* rite.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 36) goes on to add that the dumb and the insane, as
never fit for the sacraments, are not to be regarded as ‘apostates’ by
reason of the omission of the sacraments; so that in the event of their
having children these latter do not lose their Brāhmaṇa-hood or their
right to the sacraments.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 347) quotes this verse as from Manu and
Yama both.
