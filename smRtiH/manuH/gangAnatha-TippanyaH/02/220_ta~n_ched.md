‘*Dinam*’—“The translation of the last words (*Shall fast during the
next day muttering the Sāvitrī*) follows Govindarāja and Kullūka; while
Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda state that the penance shall be
performed *during the (next) day (or night*), and that he who neglects
the evening prayer shall fast in the evening and repeat the Gāyatrī
during the night.”—Buhler.

Medhātithi is not quite accurately represented here. For his view is
clearly put in paras 2 and 3, on page 575 (Translation) where the view,
that “if the offence is committed in the evening the reciting and
fasting are to be done during the night”, has been rejected in
unmistakable terms.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 447), as
laying down an expiation for sleeping at sunrise;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 398), as laying down the expiation for repeated
delinquency.
