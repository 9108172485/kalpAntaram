*Medhātithi* (p. 75, 1. 5)—*Kāraṇagrahaṇāt*.’—When a *custom* or even a
Smṛti rule, is found to be actually based upon some material motive,—no
authority can attach to such custom or rule. Read in this connection
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 1. 3. 4, which discusses the authoritative character of
such *Smṛti* rules as, while not contradicting any Śruti-rule, are yet
found to be due to ignorance or covetousness; *e.g*. the text laying
down that the cloth with which the sacrificial post is covered should be
given to the priest. The conclusion on this point is that such rules
have no authority. (See, for further details, Prābhākara—Mīmāṃsā, pp.
138-139).

This verse is quoted in the Madanapārijāta (p. 12);—in the *Dānamayūkha*
(p. 7);—in the *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 4),—and in the
Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣa (p. 55), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Paramparya*;’ is the same as ‘*paramparā*’, ‘Tradition,’—*i.
e*., that whose beginning cannot be traced;—this precludes the authority
of *modern* customs;—‘*antarāla*’ are the mixed castes;—it quotes
Medhātithi to the effect that the purport of this verse is to eulogise
the custom of the particular country, and not to deny the authority of
the customs of other countries.
