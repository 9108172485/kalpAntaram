This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), where the
distinction is made between ‘*parīvāda*’ which is *the proclaiming of
wrongs really* *committed*, and ‘*nindā*’ the *setting forth of wrongs
not committed*.

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 107);—in *Aparārka* (p.
56);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 120), which says that the
‘*parīvāda*’ is the mentioning of such defects as are really present,
and ‘*nindā*’ the mentioning of such as are not present;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 41), which notes the same distinction;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 45b);—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p.
33).
