This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458), as laying
down the duties of the life-long Student under an efficient
Brāhmaṇa-teacher;—to the same effect in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504);—also
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 551), where the term ‘*asmai*’ is
explained as standing for such a student as is not lame or dwarf, or
blind, or otherwise incapacitated; and it is added that the provision of
tins ‘life-long studentship’ need not be incompatible with the texts
laying down a *life-long* performance of the *Agnihotra* for the
Brāhmaṇa (which involves the necessity of taking a wife); because the
latter is meant for only those students who intend to enter the
‘Household,’ and are on that account called ‘*Upakurvāṇa*,’ as
distinguished from the ‘*Naiṣṭhika*’ who remains a ‘student’ all his
life and never enters the household.

This is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 72) as indicating the optional
character of *life-long* studentship;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
171) as discounting the view that “*life-long* studentship is meant only
for the maimed and other incapable persons;”—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 62), to the same effect.
