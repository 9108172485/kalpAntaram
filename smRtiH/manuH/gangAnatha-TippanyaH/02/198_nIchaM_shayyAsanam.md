This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 491), where it is
added that this does not apply to carts and other such conveyances in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 106);—in *Aparārka* (p. 56);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 40 ), which explains the last clause to mean that ‘he should not
spread out his legs and so forth’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
120), which says that this refers to cases other than riding on a
bullock and so forth, where *sitting together* cannot be avoided.
