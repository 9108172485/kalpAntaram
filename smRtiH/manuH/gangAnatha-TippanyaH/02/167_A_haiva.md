*Cf. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*, 11. 5. 7. 4.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509), which adds
the following explanatory notes:—The meaning is that the man who, even
though wearing the garland,—*i.e*. though not observing the rules and
restrictions strictly,—sedulously carries on Vedic study, carries on
excellent austerity ‘to the very fingertips—the particle ‘*ha*’
indicates that the fact stated is universally recognised. Thus the sense
is that “when Vedic study, carried on without strict adherence to the
rules, is conducive to excellent results,—what to say of it, when done
in strict accordance with the rules.”

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 69), which gives the *Anvaya*
as—‘*ānakhāgrebhyaḥ tapastapyate ha*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 128), which explains the meaning as one who studies the Veda to the
best of his capacity performs the ‘highest austerity, to the very
finger-tips it adds the notes—‘*ha*’ indicates that what is stated here
is well-known,—‘*sragvī*’, wearing a garland, *i.e*. even though not
strictly observing the restraints and observances.
