This verse is quoted in *Bālambhaṭṭi* (Vyāvahāra, p. 606).

*Medhātithi* (p. 116, 11. 11-12)—*Pariśiṣṭorthavādaḥ
āṣandhyopāsanavidhiḥ*—*i.e*. upto verse 100, all this is mere Arthavāda.
But on p. 110, he says that verse 97 contains a *vidhi*.

It is interesting to note that what Medhātithi has called Arthavāda,
Hopkins calls ‘elaborate interpolation’ (note on verse 91).
