(Verse 128 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 272);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
618);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 119);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(pp. 297 and 341), which says that ‘*rūpa etc*.’ means that one should
shun that water which has an evil smell, bad colour and bad taste; the
natural colour and taste of water are white and sweet, and though there
is no natural smell, yet of transferred smell only the agreeable one is
to be accepted, hence the meaning is that water should be used only when
it is either odourless or has an agreeable odour;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha, p. 14b);—and in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 81).
