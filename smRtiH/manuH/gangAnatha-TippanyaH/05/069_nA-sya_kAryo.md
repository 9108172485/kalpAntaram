(Verse 69 of other commentators).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2), which explains ‘*araṇye
kāṣṭhavat tyaktvā*’ as follows:—‘Just as on throwing a log of wood in
the forest, people take no notice of it, so having buried the child,
they should take no further notice of him, in the way of performing his
*Śrāddha* and other after-death rites.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 870), which explains the meaning to he
that, the child less than two years old, *which has not had its
Tonsure*, should be either buried or thrown into the water, without any
after-death rites;—and again on p. 911, where it is said that the
digging &c. are meant for the child who has had his Tonsure done during
the first year. It is difficult to reconcile the two statements.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which also says that, these
two verses refer to the case of the child who has had his Tonsure
performed during the first year;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 122), which
explains ‘*araṇye*,’ ‘in forest,’ as meaning in ‘uncultivated ground,’
and ‘*Kāṣṭhavat*’ as implying that they should not grieve over it;—and
in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 6).
