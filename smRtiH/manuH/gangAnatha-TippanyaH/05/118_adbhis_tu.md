(Verse 118 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.184), which adds that when a
lager portion of the heap is defiled, then the whole lot should be
washed; while if a smaller portion only is defiled, then that small
quantity should be washed;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 453), which adds that
what is indicated by ‘*bahūnām*’ ‘large quantities’, is that quantity
which is more than what can be carried by one man;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 136);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 297);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 805);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 166);—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 310);—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra*, (p. 248), which
notes that ‘*bahutva*’, ‘largeness of quantity’, is to be determined by
the consideration of what can be carried by one or more men.
