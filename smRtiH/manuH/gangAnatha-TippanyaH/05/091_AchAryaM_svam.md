(Verse 91 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācarā, p. 633) to the effect
that there is nothing wrong in the Religious Student carrying the dead
body of the persons named here;—and in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 391);—in
*Hāralatā* (p. 201) to the effect that when there are no other persons
available for carrying the dead body of the Teacher and the rest and
perform their cremation, then the person who has undertaken vows and
observances may do the needful, and this does not interfere with his
observances,—it explains ‘*ācārya*’ as the person who has done the
initiation and taught the entire Veda, the ‘*upādhyāya*’ is one who has
taught a portion of the Veda or the Subsidiary Sciences, and ‘*guru*’ is
the person who expounds the Veda and the Sciences;—and in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 294).
