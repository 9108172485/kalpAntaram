**(verse 5.4)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 8) to the
effect that laziness also is the source of a ‘force’ that brings about
untimely death;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which explains
‘*ālasya*’ as ‘not being disposed to perform one’s duty, even when he is
able to do it’;—‘*annadoṣa*’ as standing for defective production and so
forth;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 294.)
