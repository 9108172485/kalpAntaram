(Verse 144 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 922); and again on (p. 926),
where it explains the meaning to be that ‘if one vomits after having
eaten food, he must wash’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.30), which adds, like
*Aparārka*, that the last clause refers to sexual intercourse during the
wife’s ‘courses’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 106), which notes that
‘*viriktaḥ*’ means ‘one who has abnormal purgings,’—and that the meaning
is that ‘if one vomits after he has taken his food, he should only
*wash*, and *not bathe*’;—and again on p. 199 where the construction of
the second half is explained as ‘*bhuktvā annam vāntaḥ*,’ whence the
meaning is that on vomitting immediately after food, there should be
*washing only*,—the particle ‘*eva*’ serving to preclude the *bathing*
which is prescribed in the first half of the verse for one who has
‘vomitted’;—the ‘sexual intercourse,’ refers to that during the
courses;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 331), which explains ‘*viriktaḥ*’ as
‘one who has had many motions,’ and adds that if one vomits immediately
after taking his food, he is simply to rinse his mouth, and for the man
who has had sexual intercourse during the wife’s ‘period,’ he is
cleansed by bathing;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 334), which says that
‘*vāntaḥ*’ is understood after ‘*bhuktvā annam*,’ and adds the same
notes;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 796).
