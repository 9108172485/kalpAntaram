(Verse 115 of others.)

‘*Utpavanam*’—‘Throwing away of a portion’ (Medhātithi);—‘pouring
another liquid into the vessel to overflowing, so that some of the
original contents flow out’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi);—‘passing through
it of two blades of kuśa-grass’ (Kullūka, Govindarāja and
Rāghavānanda);—‘straining through cloth’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.190), which explains
‘*utpavanam*’ as ‘pouring over a piece of cloth so that foreign source
of impurity may be strained out—and in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 297) which,
reading ‘*utplavanam*’, explains it as ‘removing the insect or such
other foreign substances by straining the liquid through cloth’;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (Śrāddha, p. 16a).
