(Verse 64 of other commentators.)

“According to Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, the rule refers to such
Brāhmaṇas who for money carry a dead body to the cemetery according to
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, to Sapiṇḍas who in any way touch a corpse out
of affection;—Medhātithi thinks that it applies to all who touch or cany
out a dead body, be it for love or for money. Rāghavānanda thinks that
the text mentions three alternative periods of impurity, one day, three
days and ten days.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 883), which explains it as
laying down the period of impurity of ten days for those who touch a
dead body; it explains ‘*ahnā chaikena rātryā*’ as meaning ‘one day and
night,’ and ‘*tribhiḥ trirātraiḥ*’ as ‘nine days’;—thus ten days is the
period of impurity (for the Brāhmaṇa) touching the dead body of the
Brāhmaṇa; for the Brāhmaṇa carrying for money the dead body of other
castes, the period extends to that which has been prescribed for that
caste—says the *Viṣṇupurāṇa*;—*Aparārka* quotes the verse again on p.
893 to the effect that the period of impurity, for *Samānodakas* is only
three days.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 382), which also explains it as
laying down a period of ten days.
