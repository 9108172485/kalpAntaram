**(verse 5.163)**

(Verse 165 of others.)

It is not right to say that this and the next verse have been ‘omitted’
by Medhātithi, who says that he has not explained them as they are easy.
It is repeated in 9.29.

This is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 436);—and in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*
(p. 579).

**(verse 5.164)**

(Verse 166 of others.)

This is repeated in 9.30.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 436), which adds that what
is meant by ‘*patiloka*’ is that heavenly region which she has won for
herself by the religious rites she has performed in association with her
husband;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 67a).
