(Verse 67 of other commentators.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.23), where it is explained
that all that this means is that in the case of all before initiation,
the impurity lasts for three days;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 373);—and in
*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which remarks that the second half of the
verse makes it clear to what case the following two verses refer.

Medhātithi offers two constructions:—(1) By one the verse is made to
provide a rule for the impurity of the untonsured child on the death of
others;—(2) by the other, for the impurity of others on the death of the
untonsured children.
