(Verse 83 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 245) as laying down the
period of impurity for each several caste;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla,
p.288);—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 64);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p.
115);—in *Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 21);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 6), which
says that the meaning is that on the death of a *Sapiṇḍa* who is over
six years and two months of age,—for the survivor who is ignorant of the
Veda and has not set up the fires, but has passed through all the
sacramental rites, the impurity in the case of the Brāhmaṇa lasts for
ten days;—it adds that if death occurs before sunrise, then the
preceding day is to be counted among the ten,—if the survivor is an
Agnihotri or Vedic scholar, it is over in a single day;—and in
*Hāralatā* (pp. 4 and 9).
