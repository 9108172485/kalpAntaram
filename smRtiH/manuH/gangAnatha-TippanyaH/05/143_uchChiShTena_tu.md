(Verse 143 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 264), which notes that this
refers to cloth or such other substances being in the hand;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 641);—in *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 17), which quotes
Medhātithi to the effect that this refers to small things in the
hand,—such things as can not be kept aside;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
861),—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 118), which notes that this refers
to the hand being engaged in the holding of things other than articles
of food,—says *Kālpataru*;—in *Smrtisāroddhāra* (pp. 246 and 251),—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 476), which says that this refers to articles of
food;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 954), which says that according to
Medhātithi heavy objects are kept aside, but not small objects, but
according to *Smṛticandrikā* it refers to such clothing and other things
as can not be kept aside; or it may mean that sacred vessels may not be
kept aside, food and metallic things may be kept aside, and clothes and
other things may or may not be kept aside;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p.
281), which quotes Viśvarupa to the effect that this refers to things
other than food and vegetables;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 317), which
says that the man should keep the thing on his body and rinse his mouth,
by which he himself, as also the thing carried, becomes
purified;—according to *Ratnākara*, this refers to milk only.
