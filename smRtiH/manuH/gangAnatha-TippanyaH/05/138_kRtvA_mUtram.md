This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 223), the reading
wherein however is different, except in the first quarter;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 957), which has the following notes:—‘*kṛtvā*’, having
vacuated,—after evacuating the bladder and bowels one should wash the
anus and rinse the mouth, and touch the ‘holes’, *i.e*., the sense
organs,—‘*vedam etc*.,’ while engaged in other ordinary works one should
rinse his mouth before reciting the Veda, also when going to take
food,—in *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 15):—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (Āhnika, p.
8b).
