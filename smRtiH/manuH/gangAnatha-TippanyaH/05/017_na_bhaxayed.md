This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 544), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Ekacara*’ are those animals which, as a rule, roam
about alone, such for instance as serpents;—‘*ajñātāḥ*’—whose name and
species are unknown, *i.e*., one should not eat unknown animals which,
though not falling under any species either generally or specifically
prohibited, are understood by implication to be included under those
that are permitted;—nor should one eat any five-nailed animals, with the
exception of the *śaśaka* and the rest (enumerated in the next verse).
