*Cf*. 11.155, 213 and 219.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (pp. 927 and 825) as laying
down the expiation for the *unintentional* eating of the things;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317) to the same effect, with the
additional note that the ‘Sāntapana’ meant here must he that which
extends over seven days.—The last quarter is quoted twice in *Mitākṣarā*
on 3.290, to the effect that if one eats forbidden things other than
those here mentioned only *once*, and that *unintentionally*, he has got
only to fast for the day;—under 1.175 to the effect that the eating of
the forbidden birds unintentionally makes one liable to fasting for the
day;—and the first three quarters on 1.176, where it is pointed out that
it refers to *unintentional* and *repeated* eating of the things;—also
on 3.229 as laying down the expiation for unintentional eating.

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1157), to the effect that by
unintentionally eating the things enumerated repeatedly one becomes
liable to the *Yati-cāndrāyaṇa*, and by eating other forbidden things to
fasting during the day.
