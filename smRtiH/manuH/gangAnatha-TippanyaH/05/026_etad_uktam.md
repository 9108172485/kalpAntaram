This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 526), which adds the
following notes:—The rules regarding eating that have gone before are
meant for the ‘twice-born’, not for the Śūdra; hence for the latter
there is no harm in eating garlic and other things. But, according to
*Kalpataru*, the eating of the crow and such like animals and birds—even
though included among those mentioned,—must be considered wrong, even
for the Śūdra;—being as they are entirely condemned by all cultured
men.—The mention of the ‘twice-born’ in this verse implies that the
forthcoming prohibition regarding meat is meant for all the four castes.
