(Verse 95 of others.)

‘*Dimbāhava*’—a riot, or a fight without weapons (Medhātithi);—infants’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 916), as laying down additional
cases for ‘immediate purity’; it explains ‘*dimbāhava*,’ as ‘weaponless
fight’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 317), which takes
‘*āhavahata*,’ ‘killed in battle’ and remarks that this refers to
persons who have been killed ‘when fleeing from battle’, as otherwise
there would be no justification for the offerings to the dead described
in the Mahābhārata.
