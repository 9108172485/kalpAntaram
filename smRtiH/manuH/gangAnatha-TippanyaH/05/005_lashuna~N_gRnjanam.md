This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which explains
‘*amedhyaprabhavāni*’ as ‘produced directly from human ordure, or in
trees growing from seeds passed with human excreta’;—and in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 448), which reads ‘*karakāṇi*’ (for *kavakāni*) and
explains it as ‘*chatrāka*,’ ‘mushroom;’ and explains
‘*amedhyaprabhavāni*’ as ‘produced from ordure and such things.’
