This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 247);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.171),
which notes that the addition of the epithet ‘red’ makes it clear that
the prohibition does not apply to such exudations as assafœtida, camphor
and the like;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 711), which adds—‘the
red exudations’ meant are the *lac* and the rest,—the epithet ‘red’
indicating that such exudations as are white, *e.g*., assafœtida,
camphor and the like—are not forbidden,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—‘*peyūṣa*’ is ‘new milk,’ *i.e*., the milk of the
newly-delivered cow, whose blood-flow has not ceased; and in support it
quotes verse 8 following.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 510), which adds the
following notes—‘*Vṛkṣaniryāsa*’ is ‘the solidified exudation from
trees’,—‘*Vraścana*’ is cutting, and the exudations from cuttings are to
be avoided even when they are *not red*. The prohibition does not apply
to such things as assafœtida, camphor and the like,—‘*śelu*’ is
*śleṣmātaka*,—and ‘*peyūṣa*’ is the milk of the newly dilivered cow,
which solidifies at the slightest contact with fire;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 567);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 287).
