(Verse 114 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.190);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 805);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī*, (p. 305), which explains ‘*Kṣāra*’ as
‘ashes’—‘*amlodaka*’ as the juice of lemon and such things, this latter
goes with ‘tāmra’ and ‘kṣārodaka’ with rest ,—*washing* goes with
all,—‘*yathārham*’ sufficient to remove dirt and soiling.
