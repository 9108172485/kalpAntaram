(Verse 65 of other commentators.)

‘*Pitṛmedha*’—The *Antyeṣṭi* (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘the entire Śrāddha ceremony’ (‘others’ noted by
Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 912), which says that the
‘*guru*’ meant here is *Ācārya*, and that ‘*Pitṛmedha*’ is
*Antyeṣṭi*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.24), to the effect that if the pupil
performs *Antyeṣṭi* of his *guru*, then he is to be impure for ten
days;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 381) as reiterating the ‘ten-day’ period
for all carriers of the dead body, the ‘pupil’ being mentioned only by
way of illustration.
