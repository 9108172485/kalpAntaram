(Verse 134 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 271), which explains ‘*arthavat*’
as ‘as much as may be needed for removing the smell and stains,’ and
adds that in the case of the latter six of the twelve ‘impurities’
(enumerated in the next verse) the use of clay is optional;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 51), which adds that after the passing of urine and
feces, washing with water is ‘*arthavat*,’ ‘useful’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 45), which explains ‘*arthavat*’ as ‘fulfilling the purposes
of removing the smell and stains’;—and again on p. 104, to say that Manu
should be understood to mean that *out* of the case of the twelve
‘impurities,’ in some both water and clay should be used, while in some
either of the two only;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 794).
