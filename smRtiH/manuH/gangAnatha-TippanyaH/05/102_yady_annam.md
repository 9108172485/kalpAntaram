(Verse 102 of others.)

This verse is quoted along with the preceding one in *Mitākṣarā* (on
3.14);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 413);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
632);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 294);—in *Aparārka* (p. 883), which adds
that the term ‘*daśāha*’ stands for ‘the full period of impurity laid
down for each caste’;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 59), which says that the
rule that ‘if the man does *not* live in the house, he becomes pure in
one day’ implies that if he lives in the house, it will take *three*
days;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 82), which adds this explanation—‘If one does
not sleep or eat in the house of a person under impurity, he is impure
for one day and night, and if he lives in the house but. does not eat
there, then for three days’;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 320),
which says this refers to ages other than the *Kali*;—in *Śuddhimayūkha*
(p. 17), which interprets the rule to mean ‘if one carries the body,
lives in the house, but does not eat, then it takes three days, and if
he lives in the house and also takes food, it takes ten days’;—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 220) which says that this applies to cases where
the man is of the same caste as the dead person.
