(Verse 133 of others.)

‘*Vipruṣaḥ*.’—‘Drops of water, invisible, but perceptible by touch only’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘drops of saliva coming out of the mouth’
(Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 469), which adds the
following notes:—‘*makṣikā*’ includes all those insects whose touch
cannot be avoided;—‘*vipruṣaḥ*’ are those drops whose form is
invisible;—‘*chāyā*’—other than what is expressly forbidden;—‘*rajaḥ*’
other than what is expressly forbidden.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 296).

This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 17a);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 838);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (pp. 350 and 358), which says
that ‘*chāyā*’ stands for the shadow cast by persons *other than the
caṇḍāla*.
