(Verse 89 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 877);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
406), which adds the following notes:—‘*Vṛthājātāḥ*’ are those who do
not perform the ‘Five Great Sacrifices’;—‘*Saṅkarajātāḥ*’ are those born
of castes mixed in the reverse order;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 217),
which reads ‘*nivāpo na vidhīyate*’ for the last foot and explains
‘*nivāpaḥ*’ as *Śrāddha-Tarpaṇa*’,—in *Śuddhikaumudī*, (p. 80), which
explains ‘*Vṛthāsaṅkarajāta*’ as born of a lower caste father and higher
caste mother;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 202), which has the same explanation
and adds that such persons are precluded from all religious acts; it
adds the following remarks—Those born of higher caste father and lower
caste mothers are not called ‘*Vṛthāsaṅkarajāta*’, as these persons are
permitted to perform all religious acts to which their mother’s caste is
entitled,—‘*ātmatyāgin*’ are those who have committed suicide by hanging
or poison or some such means, or those who have renounced the duties of
their caste.
