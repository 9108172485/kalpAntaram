(Verse 86 of others.)

Kullūka and others take the verse as referring to the case where a man
happens to see an unclean thing after having done *ācamana* (preparatory
to some religious act).—Medhātithi and Govindarāja take it as referring
to the case already noted in the foregoing verse,—*i.e*., the meaning
being that ‘whenever one happens to *see* any of the unclean things just
enumerated, he shall do *ācamana* and then recite the verses
prescribed.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1198);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 796).
