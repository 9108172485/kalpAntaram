*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537) quotes this verse as *Arthavāda* to the
preceding verse, the meaning being as follows:—‘Inasmuch as in ancient
sacrifices performed by sages, edible sacrificial cakes used to be made
of animals and birds killed for the purpose, these may be killed by men
of the present day also.’ That the sacrificial cake is to be made of the
flesh of animals has been laid down in connection with the
‘Thirty-six-year Sacrificial Session’, about which we read that “on the
closing day of which, the master of the house goes out a—hunting, and
out of the flesh of the animals killed there the *Savanīya* sacrificial
cakes are prepared.”
