(Verse 141 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 353), which explains
‘*mukhyāḥ*’ as ‘those proceeding from the mouth’ and
‘*Dantāntaraviṣṭitam*’ (which is its reading for *Dhiṣṭhitam*) as ‘what
has entered between the teeth’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),
which explains *Dantānta* as between the teeth or in the teeth-cavities
and *adhiṣṭhitam* as *attached*.
