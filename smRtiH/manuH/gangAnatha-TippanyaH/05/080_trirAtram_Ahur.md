(Verse 80 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 187), and again on p. 912, where
it is added that the rule herein laid down, is meant for the case where
the pupil does *not* perform the *antyeṣṭi* for the Teacher; in a case
where he does perform it, it involves an impurity extending over full
ten days, as declared above, under verse 64.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.24), which also makes ṭhe same remark
as *Aparārka*;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 380);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
431);—in *Hāralatā* (p. 76), which explains the second half as—‘on the
death of the Teacher’s son, from whom one has not read anything, the
impurity lasts for one day and night, and so also on the death of the
Teacher’s wife, other than the one for whom Gautama has prescribed an
impurity of three days’;—in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 37);—and in
*Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 63).
