(Verse 129 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 468), which notes *that
‘brahmacārigatam bhaikṣyam*,’ stands

for all that is permitted by way of ‘alms’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
838);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 355), which explains ‘*nityam śuddhaḥ*’ as
‘even without washing, an article made by an artisan may be
used—‘*kāru*’ means ‘artisan’,—‘*paṇyam*’ is ‘merchandise’, ‘spread out’
at the place of sale;—among these, however, cooked food is an
exception;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 17a);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 250), which says that ‘*brahmacāri*’ stands for
‘*bhikṣu* in general.’
