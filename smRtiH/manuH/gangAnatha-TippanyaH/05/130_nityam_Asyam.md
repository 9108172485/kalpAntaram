(Verse 130 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 835);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(p. 355), which says the meaning is that the woman’s mouth is clean, for
the purpose of kissing;—and in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 84) which says
‘women’ means ‘one’s own wife’, and that ‘*prasrave*’ means ‘in drinking
the milk of the cow.’
