(Verse 63 of other commentators.)

According to the interpretation of Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda, the two halves of this verse are distinct, the first half
laying down that the man who emits semen is purified by bathing, and the
second half that he who begets a child is purified after three days.
According to Medhātithi however, the first half supplies the reason for
what is asserted in the second half. (See *Translation*).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 606), which
explains ‘*baijika-sambandha*’ as ‘*janyajanakabhāva*,’ ‘the parental
relationship.’

The *Hāralatā*, which has both lines of (62) explains the meaning
as—‘The untouchability due to death pertains to all *sapiṇḍas*, and that
due to birth pertains to the parents of the child only, but the full
period (ten days) of ‘impurity’ attaches to the mother only, that
attaching to the father disappears immediately on bathing.
