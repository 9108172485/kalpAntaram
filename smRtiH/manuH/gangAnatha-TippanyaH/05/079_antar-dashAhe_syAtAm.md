(Verse 79 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 386), which notes that the
period of ‘ten days’ here mentioned stands for all periods of impurity
as laid down in the several cases,—and not for that of ‘ten days’
only;—and again on p. 388.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 622);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II,
p. 237), in the sense that when there is a commingling of two causes of
impurity, the later one lapses with the earlier;—again on p. 244 to the
same effect—*i*. *e*., the period of impurity due to a later cause
becomes contracted within the limits of that due to a previous
cause;—and again on p. 247 to the same effect;—and in *Hāralatā* (p.
61), which says that the qualification ‘*punaḥ*’, ‘again’ applies to
*death* only, and draws the following conclusion:—‘If during the ten
days of impurity duetto a death, another death or a birth should occur,
then the impurity ceases after the end of the said ten days due to the
former death;’ it goes on to say. that such is not. the case if *death*
occur during the period of impurity due to a *birth*, as the impurity
due to death is more serious than that due to birth, and hence cannot
merge into the latter.
