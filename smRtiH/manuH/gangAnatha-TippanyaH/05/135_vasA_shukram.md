(Verse 135 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 271), which explains ‘*karṇaviṭ*’
as ‘ear-wax’; and adds that these are ‘impure’ only when they have gone
out of the body, as is indicated by verse 132 above;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on
1.190);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 103), which adds the following
notes:—‘*vasā*’ is the oily substance in the body; ‘*asṛk*’ is blood;
‘*majjā*’ is the solidified fatty substance within the skull; ‘*dūṣikā*’
is the rheum of the eyes; ‘*karṇaviṭ*’ is ear-wax; the term ‘*nṛ*’ here
stands for *human* beings only, and not for all *living beings* (as the
root *nṛ*, ‘ to go,’ might imply); if the latter were meant, then the
term ‘*nṛṇām*’ would be entirely superfluous;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
794);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 484);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 347);—in
*Ācāramayūkha* (p. 14),—which explains ‘*dūṣikā*’ as *netramalam*’;—and
in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 303).
