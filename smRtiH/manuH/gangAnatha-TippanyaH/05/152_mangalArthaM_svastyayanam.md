(Verse 152 of others.)

‘*Svastyayanam*’—‘The recitation of benedictory verses’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘the *Puṇyāhavācana* and the rest’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the recitation
of the texts that precede the nuptial *Homa*’ (Rāghavānanda and
Nandana);—‘that whereby welfare is acquired,’ (Medhātithi who does *not*
connect the word with ‘*yajñaḥ*’).

‘*Prajāpateḥ*’—Medhātithi takes this as ‘referring to the oblations at
marriage to Prajāpati with the mantra *Prajāpate na tvadetanya &c*.’
(Ṛgveda 10.121.10), laid down in certain Gṛhyasūtras;—Nārāyaṇa holds
that ‘*Prajāpatī*’ here stands for Manu, who is the guardian deity of
the bride.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 853),.which adds
the following notes:—‘*Svastyayana*’ means ‘the request to Brāhmaṇas for
the pronouncing of the benedictory syllable
*svasti*,’—‘*Prajāpati-yajña* means ‘the offering of cooked rice into
fire to Prajāpati’;—and in *Vyavahāra Bālambhaṭṭi* (p. 529).

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 130) which adds the following
notes:—‘*Svastyayanam*’ stands for the wearing of gold for the purpose
of passing a happy life, or for the request to Brāhmaṇas for pronouncing
the syllable *svasti*; and the offering ‘to Prajāpati’ is that which is
made during marriage to Prajāpati as the deity;—the ‘*svāmyakāraṇa*’ is
the ‘giving’, the actual *giving away*, not the mere *betrothal*.
