This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 343), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘*vaka*’ and the ‘*balākā* are well known birds
;—*kākola* is the *Droṇakāka*;—‘*khānjarīṭa*’ is the
*khañjana*;—‘*matsyādāḥ*’ are the alligator and the like;—the
prohibition of the ‘*viḍvarāha*’ implies the sanction of the *wild
boar*.—‘*ṣarvaśaḥ*’ means in every way’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
583).
