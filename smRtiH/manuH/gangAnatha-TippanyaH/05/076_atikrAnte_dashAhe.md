(Verse 76 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.21) in support of the view
that in the case of one hearing of the death of a relative in other
countries, after one year of the death, he becomes purified by bathing
and making the water-offering;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 428), where
‘*āpaḥ*

*spṛṣtvā*’ is explained as ‘bathing’; and it adds that this refers to
cases of the death of relatives other than the Father or the Mother;—in
*Nirṇaysindhu* (p. 385);—in *Hāralatā* (p. 32), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘after the lapse of ten days and upto one year, the
Sapiṇḍas are impure for three days, and after one year, the Sapiṇḍas
become pure by mere bathing, but not so the parents of the dead’;—in
*Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 70);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 126);—and in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 34 and 73), which adds that ‘*daśāha*’ stands for
the full period of impurity.
