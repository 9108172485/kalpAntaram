(Verse 92 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 870), which adds that the word
‘*Nirharaṇīyāḥ*’ is to be supplied after ‘*dvijātayaḥ*’;—and that
‘*Yathāyogam*’ (for which it reads ‘*Yathāvarṇam*’) means that the
castes are to be taken in the reverse order; *i.e*., Brāhmaṇa through
the *eastern* the Kṣatriya through the northern and the Vaiśya through
the western gate,—this on the strength of a text quoted from the
*Adityapurāṇa*.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 634);—in *Nirṇayasindhu*
(p. 414);—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 111);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
216),—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 119), which notes that the castes are
mentioned in the reverse order because the subject spoken of is an
extremely inauspicious one, and by adopting this order the writer avoids
the use of the epithet ‘dead’ directly in

connection with the higher castes;—it explains ‘*Yathāyogam*’ as ‘in the
inverse order, *i.e*., the Vaiśya, the Kṣatriya and the Brāhmaṇa
respectively’.
