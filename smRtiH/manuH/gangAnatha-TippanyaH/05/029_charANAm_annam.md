This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 527), which adds—the
‘*cara*’ are the deer and the rest,—the ‘*acara*’ grasses
etc.,—‘*damṣṭṛn*’, the tiger and others, ‘*adamṣṭṛn*,’ the deer and the
like,—‘*sahasta*’ are men and the like,—and ‘*ahasta*’ fish etc.,
‘*śūra*’ are brave persons—and ‘*bhīru*’ are the timid.
