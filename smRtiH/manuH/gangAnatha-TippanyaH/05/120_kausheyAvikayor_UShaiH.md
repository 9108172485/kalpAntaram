(Verse 120 of others.)

‘*Aṃśupaṭṭa*’—‘Cloth made of thinned bark’ (Govindarājā, Nandana and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘women’s garments made of fine cloth’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 138), which
describes ‘*āvika*’ as ‘*kambala*, blanket’,—‘*kauśeya*’ as
‘silk’,—‘*aṃśupaṭṭa*’ as *netrapaṭa*—‘*ariṣṭa*’ as ‘the fruit of the
Putrajīva berry’,—‘*kutapa*’ as ‘a particular kind of blanket made of
the wool of goats common *in the, regions of Avantī* (Ujjain) (or var:
lec: *in mountainous regions*);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805).
