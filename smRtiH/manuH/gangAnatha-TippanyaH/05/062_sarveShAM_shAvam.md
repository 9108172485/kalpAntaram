title = "062 सर्वेषां शावम्"

+++
Medhātithi and Govindarāja omit the first line of 61 and the first line
of 62; so that in the place of 61 and 62, they read only one verse made
up of the second lines of both 61 and 62.

This verse is quoted in *Hāralāta*, (p. 15), which explains ‘*evameva*’
as standing for ‘ten days’ and other periods;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha*,
(p. 37).
