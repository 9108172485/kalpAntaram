(Verse 104 of others.)

According to Nārāyaṇa this rule is meant for Brāhmaṇas only; but
Medhātithi says that the ‘*vipra*’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration; the rule applies to all the three higher castes.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.20);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 634), which reproduces the remark made in *Mitākṣarā* that
the phrase ‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ is superfluous, in view of the assertion
(in the second half) that the touching of the body by the lower castes
is ‘*asvargya*,’ which would imply that the body should not be so
touched, irrespective of the presence or absence of the dead person’s
‘own people’;—and in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 17).

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 395), which also adds the same
remark;—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 120) which says —‘*sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu*’ means
that if possible the dead body of a Brāhmaṇa should be carried by
Brāhmaṇas alone, in the absence of Brāhmaṇas by Kṣatriyas, even by
Vaiśyas in the absence of Kṣatriyas, and by Śūdras only when there are
no Vaiśyas—‘*asvargyā*,’ this also refers to cases where twice-born
persons are available.
