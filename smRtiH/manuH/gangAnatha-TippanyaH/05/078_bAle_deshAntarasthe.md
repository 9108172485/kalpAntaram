VERSE LXXVII

(Verse 78 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 905), which notes that
‘*deśāntarastha*,’ ‘in a distant country,’ qualifies both the ‘*bāla*’
and the ‘*asapiṇḍa*’;—again on p. 909, where the ‘*pṛthakpiṇḍa*’ is
explained as the ‘non-sapiṇḍa and the ‘*bāla*’ as ‘one whose naming has
not been done’;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 33), which explains ‘*deśāntarastha*’
etc., to mean that ‘on hearing of the death of a Sapiṇḍa after the lapse
of ten days, those for whom the normal period of impurity is one day
only, becomes purified immediately, by bathing only;—and in
*Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 25).

The verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 274).
