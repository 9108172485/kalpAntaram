(Verse 119 of others.)

‘*Vaidalānām*’—‘Objects made of the bark of trees and such things’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘made of split bamboo’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 139);—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 311) which
explains ‘*Vaidalānām*’ as ‘things made of split bamboo’, which are
purified like cloth,—and ‘*dhānyavat*’ as ‘large quantities by
sprinkling water and small quantities by washing’.
