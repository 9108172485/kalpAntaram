This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.179) to the effect that just
as there is nothing wrong in the eating of meat which is the remnant of
sacrificial and Śrāddha offerings, so also there is none in eating that
which is left after the dependents have been fed.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 537), which adds that
animals are to he killed for feeding one’s dependents, only when there
is no other means of feeding them; and this implies also that there is
no harm in one’s eating the meat himself that is left after the feeding
of dependents;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 301).
