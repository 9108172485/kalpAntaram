(Verse 75 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 385), in support of the view
that if one cause of impurity should happen during the period of
impurity due to another cause, then the former should be regarded as
over by the end of the latter.

*Videśa* or *Deśāntara* is thus defined by ‘Vṛddha-Manu’ quoted in
*Aparārka* (p. 905):—‘That which is interposed by a great river (a river
falling directly into the sea) or by a mountain, or where the language
is different.’

It is quoted in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 70);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
232), which explains ‘*vigatam*’ as ‘dead’ and adds that this rule
applies to cases of *birth* also, and that ‘ten days’ stands for the
full period of impurity under normal conditions;—in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p.
36);—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 32) which has the following
notes:—‘*videśastham*’ in another country, *i.e*., from where the news
of death cannot come quickly,—‘*anirdaśam*,’ before the end of ten days.

In regard to ‘*videśa*’, *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 71) quotes Rudradhara
as saying that even though there be no intervening mountains or rivers,
if the distance between two countries is more than 60 *yojanas*—*e.g*.,
Tirhut and Prayāga,—they are ‘*videśa*’ to each other, but not so
between Tirhut and Kaśi, the distance between which is only 30
*yojanas*.
