**(verses 5.48-49)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 719), which adds
that the prohibition contained here pertains to the eating of meat
obtained by such killing of animals as is prohibited,—and not to that of
meat obtained by purchase; and this on the ground that it is prefaced by
the deprecating of the act of *killing*.

Verse 48 only is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 279).
