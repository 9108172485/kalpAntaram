*Cf*. The Mahābhārata 13.104.41.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 448), which explains ‘*vṛthā*’
as ‘what is cooked for oneself, and not for being offered to gods or
pitṛs’,—and quotes the *Chandogapariśiṣṭa* as defining ‘*kṛsara*’ to be
‘rice and sesamum cooked together,’—‘*saṃyāva*’ is a preparation of
‘butter, milk, molasses, and the flour of wheat and other
grains,’—‘*anupākṛtomāṃsa*’ is ‘meat not consecrated by
*mantras*,’—‘*devānna*’ is ‘food prepared for offering to
gods,’—‘*haviṣ*’ is the ‘sacrificial cake’ and such things;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 610.)
