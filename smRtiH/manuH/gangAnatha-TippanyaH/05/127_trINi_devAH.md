(Verse 127 of others.)

This is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 469) as laying down the means of
satisfaction where defilement is only suspected;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
454), which adds the following note:—‘*adṛṣṭam*’ is ‘that which has
never been known to be suspected of defilement’,—‘*vācā
praśasyate*’—when a thing has been suspected of being defiled, if the
Brāhmaṇas declare ‘may this be pure’, it has to be regarded as
pure;—such being the explanation, it adds, provided by *Dīpakalikā* and
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 818);—in *Nityācāropradīpa*
(p. 102) which explains ‘*adṛṣṭam*’, as ‘not perceived to be defiled’,
*i.e*., where no defilement is known to exist by any means of
knowledge,—‘*nirṇiktam*’, washed, when suspected of being
defiled,—‘*Vācā etc*.’ if even after washing, there is some compunction,
this is removed when the thing is commended;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p
292);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 459) which says that ‘*brāhmaṇa*’
stands for all the four castes.
