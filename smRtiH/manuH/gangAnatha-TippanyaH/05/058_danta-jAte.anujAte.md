‘*Anujāte*’—‘Younger than one that has teethed’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda; and Kullūka also, who is not
rightly represented by Buhler).

‘*Ca*’—This includes ‘one whose *Upanayana* has been performed’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 239), which adds that
according to this the impurity attaches, not only to the *Sapiṇḍas*, but
also to *Sagotras, Samānodakas*, paternal relations, maternal relations
and so forth;—‘*anujāta*,’ literally meaning ‘bora after,’ means ‘*one
born after* the *dantajāta*,’ this latter being the noun immediately
preceding the word;—the presence of ‘*ca*,’ implies the ‘initiated’
also; ‘*saṃsthīte*’ means ‘dead.’

It is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 1), which adds the following
notes:—‘*anujāta*’ is the child born after the child that has cut its
teeth, *i.e*., a ehilçl that has not cut its teeth,—‘*kṛtacūḍe ca*,’ the
‘*ca*’ is meant to include one whose Upanayana has been
performed,—‘*saṃsthite*’ on his dying,—‘*sūtaka*’ stands here for the
impurity *due to birth*, that *duo to death* having been separately
mentioned.
