This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 538), which explains
‘*ucchṛtiḥ*’ as ‘advancement’.

*Medhātithi* (P. 403, l. 22)—*Pratitiṣṭhantītivat*’—This refers to
*Mīmāṃsā Sūtṛa* 4.3.17 *et. seq*., which embodies what has been called
the ‘*Rātrisattra-nyāya*’. In connection with the ‘*Rātri*’ offerings,
it is said that ‘he who offers these obtains respectability &c.;’ and in
regard to this the question arises whether this latter passage is a mere
*arthavāda*, or it describes the result that really follows from the
offerings; and the conclusion is that, inasmuch as no other mention of
the result of the offerings is found anywhere, the passage in question
must be taken as describing the results actually following from them.
