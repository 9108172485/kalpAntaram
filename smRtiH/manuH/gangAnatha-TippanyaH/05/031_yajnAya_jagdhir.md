“*Cf*. this with the Mahābhārata, 13.114-116. In *ib* 116, 15, this is
quoted as Śruti, but in 115, 53, its gist is ascribed to Manu”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 527), which adds the
following notes:—‘*yajñāya*’ means ‘for purposes of
sacrifice’,—‘*yagdhi*’ means ‘eating’,—‘*atonyathā*’ means ‘elsewhere
than at a sacrifice’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 582).
