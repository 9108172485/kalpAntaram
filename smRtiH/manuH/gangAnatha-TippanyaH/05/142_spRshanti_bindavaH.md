(Verse 142 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 276);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 228), which notes that *pādau* here include the other limbs
also;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 113), which adds the following
notes:—

The construction is *parān ācāmayataḥ*; —*bhūmigaiḥ* means ‘the drops of
water falling on the ground’;—the use of the term *ācāmayataḥ* implies
that if the drops of water fallen from the washings of one man happen to
touch others than the one who is helping in the washing,—then those
latter do become impure;—*pādau* includes other parts of the body
also,—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 251),—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 972),
which says that the construction is *parānācamayataḥ pādau*, and the
meaning is that ‘when one is pouring water for another person rinsing
his mouth, then if the water dropped by the latter falls upon the feet
of the former, it does not make him unclean, because that water is
*bhaumikaiḥ samāḥ*, clean as any ordinary water on the ground,—it
follows that this refers only to the man who is pouring water for the
other; other persons standing by do become unclean by the water-drops
falling on then feet,—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 281);—and in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 353).
