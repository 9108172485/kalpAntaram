(Verse 68 of other commentators.)

‘*Asthisañcayanādṛte*’—‘Place free from bones’ (Medhātithi, also
Mitākṣarā);—‘without the rite of bonecollecting’ (Kullūka, who quotes
Viśvarupa’s explanation which agrees with Medhātithi’s).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 271), which says that this
refers to the case of the death of a child who has had his tonsure
performed during the first year;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.2) which explains
the meaning to be that ‘the child should be decked with garlands and
sandal-paint and should be buried in a clean place, away from the
burning grounds, hut outside the village,—which should he free from
bones.

It is quoted in *Hāralatā* (p. 121), which has the following
notes:—‘*ūnadvivārṣikam*’, one whose tonsure has not been performed
,—‘*alaṅkṛtya*’, having endowed the dead body with rings, clothes,
flowers, garlands and so forth, they should bury it in some pure spot
outside the village; and even though the body would soon become
decomposed and hence the rite of *picking of the, bones* might he
possible, it should not be done.
