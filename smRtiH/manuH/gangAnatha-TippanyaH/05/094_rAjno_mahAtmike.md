(Verse 94 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.27), in support of the view,
that the rule that ‘no impurity attaches to the king’ holds only with
regard to such acts of making gifts, receiving and honouring people and
hearing suits as are essential for the safety of the people; and it does
not apply to the performance of the ‘Five Great Sacrifices’ and other
religious acts.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 616);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(p. 70), which explains ‘*māhātmika sthāna*’ as the *seat of judgement*,
in connection with which there can be no impurity;—and in *Hāralatā* (p.
110) which explains the meaning to be ‘for the king who is occupying
*the position of God, the Lord of all things*’, ‘*māhātmikasthāna*’,
there is immediate purification,—not so for one who has lost his
kingdom; as the ground for the immediate cessation of impurity lies in
the fact that he occupies the judgment seat when he comes to the work of
administering justice and protecting the people.’
