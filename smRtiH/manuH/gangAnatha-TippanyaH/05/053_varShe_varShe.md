In the Mahābhārata (13.114.15) this occurs as writer’s ‘*matam mama*,’
but it has ‘*māse*’ for ‘*varṣe*’—says Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.181), to the effect that the
merit of the performance of *Aśvamedha* accrues to one who renounces
meat for a full year;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 533), which
adds that according to Medhātithi, this is mere *Arthavāda*, and not the
declaration of a result that actually follows from the act,—this being
based upon the principle laid down by Jaimini under 4.3.1. It goes on to
add that this view is not right; as this case is not analogous to that
of Jaimini 4.3.1,

A ‘declaration of rewards’ is regarded as an ‘*Arthavāda*’ only when
there is some other passage mentioning another reward in connection with
the same act; in the present case, however, we do not find any other
passage speaking of any other rewards accruing from the renouncing of
meat for one year; so that this comes under the *Rātrisattranyāya*
(Jaimini 4.3.17 *et. seq*.; see note under verse 40). It concludes with
the remark that the reward accruing from the renouncing of meat for one
year,—even though of the same kind as that following from the
*Aśvamedha*—is of a much lower *degree*;—and quotes the following
*Kārikā* of ‘Bhaṭṭapāda’—
