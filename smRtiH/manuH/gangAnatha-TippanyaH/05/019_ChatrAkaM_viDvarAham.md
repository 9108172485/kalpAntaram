This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1157), which notes that the
intentional eating of these things make the twice-born person an
‘outcast,’ *i.e*., disqualifies him from all that is done by twice-born
persons, and the expiation for this would be the same as that prescribed
for wine-drinking.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.176), which says that this refers to
intentional and repeated eating of the things; also on 3.229;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 317), as referring to intentional
eating;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 825) to the effect that the
intentional eating of forbidden things is equal to wine-drinking; and
again on p. 927, to the effect that *it is intentional and repeated*
eating that is equal to wine-drinking and hence makes one outcast, while
by intentionally eating these only *once*, one only becomes liable to
the performance of the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.
