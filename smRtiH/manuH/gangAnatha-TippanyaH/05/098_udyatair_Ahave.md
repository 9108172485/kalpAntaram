‘*Śastra*’, ‘*weapon*’, is that by which people are slain, killed; hence
by the present rule, also for the man who is killed by pieces of stone
or a club or such other things, sacrificial performances become
completed.

‘*Āhava*’, ‘Battle is so called because in this men are *challenged*
(*āhūyante*) to fight, through mutual rivalry.

‘*Manner befitting the Kṣatriya*;—*i.e*., never turning his
back,—fighting in the defence of his people, or under orders from his
master.

‘*Sacrificial performances*’—such as the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest;—‘*become instantly completed*’—finished. That is, the man becomes
endowed with the merit proceeding from the due performance of the
sacrifices.

Impurity also in their case is the same; *i.e*. it ceases immediately.

Some people construe the term ‘*sadyaḥ*’, ‘*instantly*’, with the word
‘*killed*’; and according to this what is said here would apply to the
case of only that man who actually dies on this battle-field, and not to
one who is moved away from there and dies on some other day.

This point however is open to question.—(97).
