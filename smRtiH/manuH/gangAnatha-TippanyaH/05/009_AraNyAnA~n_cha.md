“*Cf*. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.3.9, for an early list of animals whose
flesh is forbidden”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
448), which adds that the term ‘*mṛga*’ here stands for animals, and not
for the *deer* only; since the ‘buffalo’ is cited as an
exception;—‘*śukta*’ is the name of those things that, by themselves
sweet, become soured by keeping.

The first half is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 246), which adds that the
phrase ‘*payovarjyam*’ has to be supplied.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika p. 525), which takes
‘*āraṅyānām mṛgāṇām*’ together, and explains it as standing for the
Ruru, Mahiṣa, Pṛṣata and the rest;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha p.
13a);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 567);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
335);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 323).
