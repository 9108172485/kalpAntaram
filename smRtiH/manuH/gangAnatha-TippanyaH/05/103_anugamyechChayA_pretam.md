(Verse 103 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.26), which explains ‘*jñāti*’
as ‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 918), which adds that this
applies to one who follows the dead body intentionally, and not to one
who happens to go with it by mere chance;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 212).

This verse is quoted in *Śuddhimayūkha* (p. 22), which explains
‘*jñāti*’ as ‘one belonging to the same caste,’ *not* a *sapiṇḍa*, and
adds that ‘eating of butter’ means fasting.

It is quoted in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 225), which explains ‘*jñāti*’ as
‘mother’s sapiṇḍa’;—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 332);—in *Hāralatā* (p.
86) which has the, following notes:—‘*Pretam*,’ a Brāhmaṇa dead,—if one
intentionally follows he becomes pure by touching fire and eating not
butter, this is what is meant, and *not* that the impurity ceases on
this alone, because even without following the dead body, the death of a
relative involves an impurity for ten days; the following of a
non-relative (‘ajñāti’) however involves only the touching of fire and
eating of butter, and no further impurity.
