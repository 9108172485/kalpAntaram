(Verse 145 of others.)

*Cf* 2.70.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1139), which adds that the
‘water-sipping’ here laid down for lying is to be combined with the
repeating of the *Gāyatrī*—the water-sipping removing the uncleanliness
and the *Gāyatrī* removing

the sin;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.196);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 115),
which notes that though this verse clearly implies that water-sipping is
not done for the purpose of removing impurity, yet it is absolutely
necessary, whenever one eats or drinks;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
224);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 423), which says that this
refers to unintentional lying;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 523),
which adds that ‘*prayatopi*’ means ‘though he may have already
washed’;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 349), which explains
‘*Adhyeṣyamāṇaḥ*’ as ‘going to read.’
