(Verse 132 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 50);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 103), which explains ‘*khāni*’ as ‘cavities’ and adds that
(though there are only *two* cavities below the navel) the text uses the
plural ‘*tāni*’ by regarding the male and female generative organs as
distinct;—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 85), which explains ‘*khāni*’ as
‘holes’, ‘*medhyāni*’ as ‘clean’, and ‘*adhaḥ*’ as ‘below the navel’;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 842);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 359), which
explains ‘*medhyāni*’ as ‘touchable’, and ‘*amedhyāni*’ as ‘untouchable’
and ‘*dehachyuta-mala*’ as standing for the nails and other
excrescences, which also are ‘untouchable’.
