(Verse 155 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, pp. 52 and 129),
which says that if she does the fasting with the husband’s permission,
there is nothing wrong;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 675), which says that
this refers to the ‘month-fast’ and so forth, and not to those in
connection with the *Gaurīvrata* and the like;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, p. 67a);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī*, (p. 579);—in
*Purṣārthacintāmaṇi*, (p. 201);—in *Smṛtisāroddhara*, (p. 101);—in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 176);—in *Kālamādhava* (p. 257);—in *Aparārka* (p.
602), which adds that the wife may, with her husband’s permission, keep
such fasts and observances as are not incompatible with her attendance
upon him;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 193);—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p.
729) to the effect that religious acts art; to be performed by the wife
only in association with her husband.
