This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika p. 540), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kravyādaḥ*’ are the vulture and other birds that eat
raw flesh only, and also the peacock and others that eat both raw and
cooked flesh;—‘*grāmanivāsinaḥ*’ stands for such village-birds as the
pigeon and the like, which do not eat flesh;—the term *Śakunīn* is to be
construed with both ‘*kravyādaḥ*’ and ‘*grāmanivāsinaḥ*’;—*ekaśapha*’
are the horse and other one-hoofed animals,—‘*anirdiṣṭaḥ*’ means ‘those
that are not mentioned in the *Śruti* as fit for eating’; those that are
mentioned as such should certainly be eaten; this refers to such
sacrificial animals as are mentioned in the Vedic texts like the
following:—‘One should sacrifice the horse to Tvaṣṭṛ’; which implies
that the flesh of the horse so sacrificed must be eaten;—‘*Ṭiṭṭibha*’ is
the name of the bird that makes the ‘*ṭī ṭī*’ sound.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 582);—and in *Smṛtisāroddhārā*
(p. 298).
