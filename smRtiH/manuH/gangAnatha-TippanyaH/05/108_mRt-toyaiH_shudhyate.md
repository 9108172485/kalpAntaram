(Verse 108 of others.)

This verse is quoted in ‘*Parāśaramādhava*’ (Ācāra, p. 536), which adds
the following notes:—Some people have understood the last quarter of the
verse to mean that it is the Brāhmaṇa only, not the Kṣatriya or the
Vaiśya, that is entitled to ‘Renunciation’; and in support of this there
are several *Śruti* and *Smṛti* texts.—Others however have held that all
the four stages are meant for all the twice-born persons; and the texts
that prohibit Renunciation for the *non-* *Brāhmaṇa* should be
understood as prohibiting only the wearing of the dull red garment and
the taking of the staff (which have been laid down in connection with
the life of the Renunciate).

The verse is also quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 116), in
support of the view that the woman’s sin of evil intentions is removed
by her menstruation—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 249);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 792);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 13b).
