This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 540), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kalaviṅka*’ is the *caṭaka*, the sparrow; these being
already included under ‘*grāmanivāsinaḥ*’, their separate mention is
meant to indicate that they are *always* to be avoided; which implies
that the ‘*cāṣa*’ and other ‘*grāmanivāsi*’ birds *may be* eaten. \[All
this hitter note is attributed to Medhātithi by the writer; but no words
to this effect are found in Medhātithi; see *Translation* \].—The
epithet ‘*grāma*’ in ‘*grāmakukkuṭaḥ*’ indicates that *wild kukkuṭa* is
not forbidden; ‘*sārasa*’ in the bird called ‘*puṣkara*,’ which has a
long neck, long feet and is of blue colour;—‘*Rajjudāla*’ is the
*wood-pecker*;—‘*dātyūha*’ the *black-necked* bird;—‘*Śuka*’ is
*parrot*;—‘*sārikā*’ is well known by its own name.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 583).ted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 583).
