(Verse 111 of others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 255), which explains
‘*taijasāni*’ as ‘gold and the rest;’—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.183), which
remarks that this pertains to vessels that are soiled;—that there is to
be option between ‘ash’ and ‘clay,’ but either of these has to be
combined with ‘water,’—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 15b);—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 305).

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 134), which remarks
that this pertains to soiled vessels;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 432) to the
effect that eating out of a stone dish is permitted;—and in
*Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 96).
