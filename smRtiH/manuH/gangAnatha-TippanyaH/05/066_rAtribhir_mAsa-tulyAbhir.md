(Verse 66 of other commentators.)

“Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda think that this rule refers to miscarriages
which happen during the first six months of pregnancy; and that from the
seventh month, whether the child lives or not, the full period of
impurity must he kept. Nārāyaṇa moreover asserts that in the first and
second months the impurity shall last three
days”.—Buhler.—‘*Sādhvī*’.—‘Becomes pure’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘chaste’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.20), which explains the second
half to mean as follows:—‘The woman in her courses becomes pure—*i.e*.,
fit for religious functions—on bathing *after the cessation of the
menstrual flow*; but as regards touchability, she becomes fit for it by
bathing on the fourth day, even though the flow may not have ceased
entirely.

The verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 369);—in *Śuddhikaumudī*
(p. 3);—in *Hāralatā* (p. 68), which says that, the plural number in
‘*rātribhiḥ*’ indicates that miscarriage is a source of purity only when
it occurs in the third and subsequent months of the pregnancy, and that
the mention of the ‘woman’ in the second line makes it clear that the
impurity due to miscarriage also attaches to the wife only, and not to
the husband;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 25a).
