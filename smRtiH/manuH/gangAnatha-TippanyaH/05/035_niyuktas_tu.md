This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 251), which explains ‘*niyuktaḥ*’
as ‘invited, at a sacrifice to the gods or at a Śrāddha’;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(on 1.179) to the effect that one must eat meat when iṅvited to a
Śrāddha;—in

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 294) as setting forth the sinfulness of not eating
the meat duly offered;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 530), which
explains ‘*sambhavān*’ as ‘births’;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 449);—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 577);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 279), which
remarks that this refers to such meat as is not forbidden.
