retain any such unclean thing as wine, food leavings and so forth’;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 805);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 134),

used by Medhātithi), *i*. *e*., ‘the chasings in which are not filled
in’;—in *Nityācārapradīpa*, (p. 96), which explains ‘*nirlepam*’ as
absolutely unsoiled;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī*, (p. 305), which explains
‘*abja*’ as ‘conches, shells and the like,’—‘*ca*’ as including
