This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Jñāti*’ are paternal relations;—‘*sambandhi*’,
maternal relations;—‘*kṛtalakṣaṇāḥ*’, branded;—‘*nirdayāḥ*’, undeserving
of the sympathy of gentlemen, even when suffering from
diseases;—‘*nirnamaskārāḥ*,’ not deserving of salutations even though
possessing seniority and such other qualifications.
