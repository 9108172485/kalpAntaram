title = "119 अजाविकं सैकशफम्"

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.119), to the effect that of the
animals mentioned, if an odd one remains after partition, it is to be
given to the eldest brother;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 686), to the same
effect;—in *Aparārka* (p. 723), which explains ‘*viṣamam*’ as a number
different from (not a multiple of) the number of brothers;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 498), which says that the odd animals are not to
be partitioned by being sold and the value divided, they should be taken
by the eldest brother;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 57).
