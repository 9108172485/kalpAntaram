This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 278), which
explains ‘*vyasanam*’ as ‘*vyasanakāraṇam*’, ‘source of trouble’—and
adds that these are so only when they defective.—It is quoted again on
p. 319, where the same notes are repeated and ‘*prakṛtīnām*’ is
explained as ‘among the factors’.
