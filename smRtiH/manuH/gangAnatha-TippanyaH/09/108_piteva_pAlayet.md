This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following explanation:—The eldest brother should take care of the
younger brothers, as if he were their father, and he should not separate
them;—‘*putravat varteran*’, they should not entertain feelings of
hatred towards him;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 513, 656 and
691);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 90), as attributing the qualities
of father and son to the elder and younger brothers respectively;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a).
