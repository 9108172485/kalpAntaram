*Cf*. the Mahābhārata 13.47.31.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 509), as laying
down the order in which the several wives of a man are to be
honoured;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 298) as declaring who is to be regarded
as the ‘Senior’ wife,

‘*Jyesṭhā*’;—also in Vol. II, p. 191;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 419),
which explains ‘*svāḥ*’ as ‘belonging to the same caste as her husband,’
and ‘*svāvarāḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*aparāḥ*’) as ‘belonging to
a different caste’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 198a);—and by
*Jīmūtavāhana* (Dāyabhāga, p. 257), which says that the wife of one’s
own caste, even though married later, would be the *Senior* and hence
entitled to associate with the husband in his religious acts.
