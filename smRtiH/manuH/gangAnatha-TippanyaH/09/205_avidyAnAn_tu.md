‘*Apitrye*’.—This is construed by Nandana as *apitryaḥ* in the sense
‘since the division has not been made by the father’;—this rule refers
to acquisitions by trade (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa), by
agriculture (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana), or service of the king
(Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 507), which explains the
meaning to be as follows:—In a case where all the brothers are
unlearned, if they acquire wealth, this wealth, which is not inherited
from the father, is to be divided equally among them, and there is not
to be any additional share to any one on the ground of any additional
amount of work that he may have done.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 57), which has the following
notes:—‘*Īhā*,’ agriculture and the rest,—‘*apitrye*,’ which does not
form part of the ancestral property.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 727);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 137), which explains ‘*īhā*’ as ‘agriculture and the rest,’—and
‘*samaḥ*’ as ‘not unequal,’ which precludes the special share of 20 per
cent.
