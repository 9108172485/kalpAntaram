‘*Guṇadoṣavicakṣaṇam*’.—‘Knowing that by performing or not performing
Śrāddhas &c. merit or sin will follow’ (Kullūka);—‘knowing himself to be
the son of such and such a person and hence likely to become an out-cast
if he did not serve him properly’ (Rāghavānanda);—‘not a minor’ (‘some’
in Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 738), which explains ‘*sadṛśam*’
as referring to *caste*;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 572), which adds
the following notes:—Here also, according to Medhātithi, ‘*sadṛśam*’
means‘of similar qualifications’;—‘*Guṇadoṣavicakṣaṇam*’ means ‘knowing
that there is merit in performing the after-death rites for the parents,
and sin in not performing them.’—‘*putragunaiḥ*’, obedience and such
qualities.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścītta, p. 38),—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 546 and 557);—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p.
74), which quotes *Vīvādacandra* to the effect that ‘*sadṛśam*’ means
‘of the same caste’;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a).
