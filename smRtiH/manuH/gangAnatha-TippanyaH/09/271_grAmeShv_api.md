‘*Bhāṇḍāvakaśadāḥ*’—‘Who give them room for concealing their implements’
(Kullūka);—‘who give them money for buying arms and other things, as
also other shelter’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 849);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
388), which adds the following notes:—‘*Bhakta*’, cooked
food;—‘*bhāṇḍa*’, thieving implements other than arms;—‘*avakāśa*’
sheltering place;—and in *Vyavahārara-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 991).
