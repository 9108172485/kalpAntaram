This verse in quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.136), which says that this refers
to cases where the brothers (the one dead and his younger brother who
beget the son on bis sister-in-law)were not divided, while verse 146
below pertains to cases where they have been divided;—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 542), which adds the following explanation:—The
undivided elder brother having died without a son, if the younger
brother begets, by commission, a son on his widow, then, when there
comes about partition between this son and his uncle-progenitor, it will
be done in equal shares, and the son shall not obtain any special share
by reason of his dead father having been the elder brother.
