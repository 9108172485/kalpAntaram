‘*Kathañcana*’.—This indicates that the eunuch and the rest are not
worthy to marry (Kullūka).

‘*Apatyam*’.—The *Kṣetraja* son (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 488), which explains
‘*tantu*’ as *child*;—in *Aparārka* (p. 750), to the effect that
marriage is legal for the persons enumerated in 201; it remarks that in
view of the epithet ‘*jāti*’, ‘born’, in the term ‘*jātyandha*’, the
present verse cannot be taken as referring to cases where the
disabilities appear after marriage; it comes to the conclusion that the
disability to inheritance cannot thus be due to their not marrying and
hence not being able to perform religious rites; it must be due to the
mere authoritative assertion of the law.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 195) as indicating that
the marriage of the said persons is sanctioned.
