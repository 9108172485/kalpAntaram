This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 720), which explains ‘*Svakād
aṃśāt*’ as ‘from the property acquired by the brothers’;—in
*Smṛtitattva* II (p. 171), in the sense that one, who, by reason of his
own capacity (to earn) is not desirous of any share in the ancestral
property, shall be given some such tiling as a seer of rice, and be
separated from the family, as a safeguard against trouble arising from
his sons and descendants;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 110).
