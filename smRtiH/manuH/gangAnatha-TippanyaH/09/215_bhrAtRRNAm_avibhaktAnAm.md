‘*Saha utthānam*.’—‘Joint acquisition—one earning by agriculture,
another by receiving gifts, another by service, another taking care of
what others bring in and so forth’ (Medhātithi);—‘joint concern,—such as
joint trading and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa).—Explained by Jīmūtavāhana
(*Dāyabhāga*, 2.86) as ‘*effort* i.e., desire to have a division’
(Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 468), which explains
‘*utthānam*’ as ‘action tending to the acquisition of wealth—in
*Aparārka* (p. 719 and p. 727) as an exception to the general that the
father may make an unequal division;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 129), which says that this refers to cases where the property has
been acquired by the equal efforts of all the brothers, and hence it
does not conflict with the text which lays down that the brothers are to
accept without demur even an unequal partition among them by their
father, of the property *acquired by him*.
