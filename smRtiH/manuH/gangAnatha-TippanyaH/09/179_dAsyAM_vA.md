This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 537), which adds the note
that the son meant is born to a slave from a slave-girl not married to
him;—the *Kalpataru* holds that the son meant is that born from the
slave-girl belonging to a personal servant;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*
(p. 566);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 38a);—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(*Dāyabhāga*, p. 222), which says that in the absence of the said
sanction, the son is to have only half a share.
