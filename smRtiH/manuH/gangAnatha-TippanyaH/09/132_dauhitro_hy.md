*Cf*. 136 and 140.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 560), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Aputrasya*’ *i.e*., one who has no ‘body-born’
son;—the second half is a mere reiteration of what goes before—says
*Prakāśa*; it is an Arthavāda providing a reason for what has gone
before—says Udayakara in his commentary on Manu. \[These remarks are
based on the reading of the second line as *dauhitra eva tu
haredaputrasyāsvilaṃ dhanam* \].

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 631 and 664);—in *Hemādri*
(Śrādha, p. 87);—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 427), which says that
the two ‘balls’ are to be offered to the father and to the mother’s
father;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 153) which adds that this
refers to cases where neither of the parents of the deceased is
alive;—and by Jīmūtavāhāna (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 278) as indicating that the
grandson is entitled to the property of his mother’s father by reason of
the mother deriving her body from that father.
