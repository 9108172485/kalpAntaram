‘(*a*) *Akṛtā vā* (*b*) *kṛtā*.’—(*a*) ‘Daughter *not appointed*
explicitly, and (*b*) one appointed explicitly’ (Kullūka);—(*b*)
‘unappointed, *i.e*., any ordinary daughter’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa
Nandana);—the ‘unappointed daughter’ is added only hyperbolically, the
meaning being that ‘when even the unappointed daughter is entitled to
inherit, the appointed one is all the more entitled’ (Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.136), to the effect that in the
absence of the son and the daughter, the property goes to the daughter’s
son. The *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that Vijñāneśvara had taken the verse as
applying *to all* daughters, but Medhātīthi has come to the conclusion
that the rule is meant for the ‘Appointed Daughter’ only.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 435), to the effect that the ‘daughter’s
son’ who inherits his grand-father’s property must offer *Śrāddhas* to
him;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 40b);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
p. 190a and 205b), which explains that the Appointed Daughter being a
‘son’, her son, even though the ‘son of a daughter’ (*dauhitra*) is
virtually the ‘son’s son’ (*pautra*); and hence just as the son’s son
inherits the property op the failure of the son, so does the daughter’s
son also, on the failure of the daughter;—and by Jîmūtavāhana
(*Dāyabhāga*. p. 224).
