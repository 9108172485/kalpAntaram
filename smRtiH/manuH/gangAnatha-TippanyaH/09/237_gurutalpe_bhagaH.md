This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635) which adds that all
this branding is to be done on the forehead;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 270),
which adds that this is meant, for those cases where the culprit is
unwilling to perform the prescribed expiation;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 304), which also adds the same remark;—in the *Aparārka*
(p. 842);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 42b);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
329);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 152b), which says that all this
penalty is meant for those who refuse to undergo the prescribed
expiations.
