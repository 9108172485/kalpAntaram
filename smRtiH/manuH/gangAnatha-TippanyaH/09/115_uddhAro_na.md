This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 476), which adds the
following explanation:—The additional share prescribed in the last
quarter of the last verse, ‘the best among them’, is not to be taken if
all the brothers are equal in learning and other qualities. This is only
by way of illustration; it means that none of the additional shares
mentioned in verses 112-114 is to be taken; as is clear from the clause
‘*yat kiñcideva deyam syāt*’; which means that some little thing is to
be given to the eldest brother, as a mark of respect due to his superior
age. When there is no difference among them on account of qualities,
then ‘Seniority’ among the brothers is to be determined by the portion
of their mothers, the son born of the senior-most wife having been
declared to be the ‘senior.’ That this is the finally adopted view (and
not a mere tentative one) is proved by the fact that both *Lakṣmīdhara*
and the *Pārijāta* have accepted the view that ‘the son of the senior
wife, even though younger in age, is to be regarded as senior.’

This is quoted by a *Jīmūtavāhana*, (Dāyabhāga, p. 74).
