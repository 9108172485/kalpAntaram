Buhler mispresents *Nandana*, being misled by the wrong reading
‘*bhartṛbhāve*’ (while the husband lives) for ‘*bhartrabhāve*’ (on the
death of the husband). There could be no division of the property by the
heirs while the husband was alive.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 686), which adds that
‘*Dhṛtam*’ means ‘possessed as her own private property, having been
given to her as a loving present’;—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 70),
which explains ‘*dhṛtam*’ as ‘presented to her by her husband or other
relatives and worn by her.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.147) in support of the view that ‘if a
woman has been living apart from her husband, her property shall not be
taken by her heirs’;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 509), which notes that the
*Prakāśa* has stated that Medhātithi has explained the meaning to be
that ‘the heirs shall not take even those ornaments that may have been
worn by the woman with her husband’s consent, even though not actually
given to her’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 752), which adds that this refers to
such ornaments as have been worn by the woman constantly;—in
*Smṛtitattva* II (p. 184), which also reproduces the aforesaid remark of
Medhātithi, that an ornament worn by the woman with her husband’s
consent becomes her property even though not actually given to her;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 332), which says that the phrase ‘*dhṛto bhavet*’
implies that what was not actually worn by her should be divided.
