This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 739), which explains the meaning
to be that the ‘*Apaviddha*’ son is one who is taken up on being
abandoned by the parents for some cause, other than his having become an
‘outcast—and in the *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 571), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Utsṛṣṭam*’, abandoned,—for some such reason as extreme poverty
and consequent incapability to maintain him, or the presence of some
defect in him; the acceptance also by the receiver should be for the
definite purpose of making him his son;—also in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 547 and 557);—and
in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 38a).
