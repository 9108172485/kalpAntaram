This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 580), which explains ‘*eṣa
dharmaḥ*’, as ‘the principle that the owner of the seed does not obtain
the fruit;’—also in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 150), which adds that the term
‘*dāsī*’ here stands for the slave-girl married to another slave; the
child of such a slave-girl belongs to the owner of the girl, not to that
of the father;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 521 and 574).
