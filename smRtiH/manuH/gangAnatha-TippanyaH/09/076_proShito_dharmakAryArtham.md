Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda hold that after the expiration of the
terms mentioned, the wife shall go to seek her husband. Nandana
says—‘the meaning is that no sin is committed if she afterwards takes
another husband’.—Medhātithi, having noted and dismissed two other
explanations—(a) that ‘she should maintain herself by blameless methods’
\[which is the explanation attributed to Medhātithi himself by Buhler\],
and (b) that ‘she may have intercourse with another man\*,—propounds the
explanation that ‘she may take service under another man as a
toilet-woman in his house, and on the return of her husband, she may
return to him, if he can induce her to go.’ He also notes and rejects
the explanation of the ‘ancients’ that ‘she may *marry* another man.’
