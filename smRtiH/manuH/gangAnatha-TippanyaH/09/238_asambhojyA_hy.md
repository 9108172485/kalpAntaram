This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Asambhojyāḥ*’, *i.e*., people should not join with
them in any convivial gatherings;—‘*asampāṭhyāḥ*’, they are unfit for
teaching;—‘*asamyājyāḥ*’, unfit for sacrificing;—‘*avivāhinaḥ*’, not
entitled to marry;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 116);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 37), to the effect that one who has committed a
‘heinous’ crime is not entitled to any of the acts to which the
twice-born are entitled.
