‘*hiḍabhaṅge*’ (which is its reading for ‘*hitābhaṅge*’ as the
destroying of crops in a field belonging to others;—in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 341), which adds the following notes—‘*Grāmaghāte*’ during village
disturbances;—‘*hitabhaṅge*’, the breaking of dams set up for the
protection of crops;—‘*moṣābhidarśana*’, looking on theft being
committed;—‘*nivāṣyāḥ*’, should be banished from the
country;—‘*saparichadāḥ*’, along with their families and belongings;—and
in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 991).
