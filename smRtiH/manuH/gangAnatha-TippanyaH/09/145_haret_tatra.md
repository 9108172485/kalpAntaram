“Medhātithi and Kullūka state that the object of this verse is to teach
that a *Kṣetraja*, if endowed with good qualities, may even receive
(against verse 120) the additional share of an eldest son;—Nārāyaṇa says
the expression ‘like a legitimate son’ is used in order to establish the
title to an equal share.”—Buhler.
