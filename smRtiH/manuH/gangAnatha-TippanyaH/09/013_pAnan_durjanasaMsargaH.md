‘*Durjanasaṃsargaḥ*’—‘Associating with wicked people, *e.g*., other
unfaithful wives’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘with adulterers’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 108);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 430), which adds that what are mentioned here are only by way of a
few illustrations of what leads to the deterioration of a woman’s
character.
