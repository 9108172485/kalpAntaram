This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.195), which adds the following
notes:—As a matter of fact, this appearing of husband and wife before
the king as plaintiff and defendant is forbidden, and as such there is
no room for this subject under the present head; but what is meant is
that if, from other sources, the king should happen to hear of the
misbehaviour of the one or the other of the party, he should interfere,
and by means of judicious punishment bring them back to the path of
righteousness; otherwise he becomes involved in sin.—*Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following explanatory notes:—‘*Svaiḥ*’, the women’s own brother and
other relations,—‘*divāniśam*,’ always,—‘*viṣayesu*’, even such objects
of enjoyment as are not actually forbidden, such as beautiful things,
tasty food, and so forth,—‘*sajjantyaḥ*’ addicted,—they should be kept
under control.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 322); in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 330), which adds that ‘though a regular law-suit
between husband and wife has been prohibited, yet if the king happens to
learn from other sources, of quarrels between them, he should intervene
and make them keep to the right path,’—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 98)
which explains ‘*sajjantyaḥ*’ as becoming ‘addicted’—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 31b).
