This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 772);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 484), which says that the meaning is that
the man whom she takes as husband does not incur any sin in marrying
her;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 805), which explains the last clause to mean
that the man also incurs no sin;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 217),
which has the same note;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 501) which
explains ‘*adīyamānā*’ as ‘not given away’, either on account of the
absence of a giver, or on account of the giver, though present, being
disregarded, and reproduces Mādhava’s explanation.
