‘*Ghātayet*.’—‘Shall cause to be flogged’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘shall cause their
hands and feet to be cut off and so forth according to the gravity of
the offence’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 804), which notes that this
refers to such gambling as is not done under the supervision of the
King’s Officers;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 392);—in,
*Mitākṣarā* (2.202), which notes that all these rules pertain to such
gambling as is accompanied by fraudulent practices, or is conducted
without the guidance of game-house-keepers appointed by the king;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 611);—and in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 109), which
explains ‘*dvijaliṅga*’ as consisting of the wearing of the sacred
thread, the reciting of the Veda and so forth.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 153), which explains the
meaning to be that the king should inflict such corporeal punishment as
the cutting off of the hands and feet, in accordance with the nature of
the act actually committed, on those who themselves do the gambling and
the betting, as also on those who as keepers of gaming houses, abet
others to do it;—‘*dvijaliṅginaḥ*’ are men who wear the marks of the
twice-born, such as the sacred thread, the sandal-paint and so forth;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 44b);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p.
166);—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra*, (p. 334).
