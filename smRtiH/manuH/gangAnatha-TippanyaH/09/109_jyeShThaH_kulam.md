This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kulam vardhayati*’, the prosperity of the family
being brought about by the adopting of proper business-methods and the
taking care of the younger brothers;—‘*vināśayati*’, all that this means
is that he is in a position to ruin the family;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 656);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra
172a).
