This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 459), which has the note
that, what is meant is that separation is considered desirable, because
it affords the opportunity for several performances of sacrifices; it is
not meant that the *separation* itself is conducive to merit, like the
performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma*, or that non-separation is sinful, like
the eating of the flesh of the animal killed by a poisoned arrow.

It in quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 719), which adds that conjoint life is
meant for those cases where some of the brothers may be still studying;
in cases where all of them have read the Veda and are capable of taking
the fires, it is far better that they should live separately;—again on
p. 722, to the effect that it is not necessary that the brothers *must*
divide immediately after the father’s death;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 125) as sanctioning partition as conducive to religions
merit;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a);—and by *Jīmūtavāhāna*
(Dāyabhāga, p. 37), which says that this is a clear case of voluntary
option.
