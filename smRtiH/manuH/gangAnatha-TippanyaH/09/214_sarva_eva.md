‘*Vikarmasthāḥ*.’—‘Addicted to gambling, drinking and similar vices’
(Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘who following despicable modes of living,
such as cattle-breeding, serving śūdras and the like’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Yautakam*.’—‘Separate hoarding’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka;—‘shall not,
out of the common property, give a dowry to his daughter’ (Nandana).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 720 and p.
749);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 480), where ‘*Vikarmasthāḥ*’ is explained
as ‘addicted to gambling and so forth’—and it is noted that others have
explained it as meaning ‘behaving in a manner calculated to ruin the
family’;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 73), in the sense that so long as
well-behaved sons are present, the property cannot go to the ill-behaved
ones;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 222a).
