‘*Yacca sātiśayam kiñcit*.’—‘A dress or an ornament’
(Medhātithi);—‘something impartible, like an idol’ (Nandana).

‘*Daśataḥ varam*’—‘The best among ten animals’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘ten superior articles’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi; the reading for ‘*varam*,’ in this case, being
‘*varān*’).—‘Everything shall he divided into ten shares and the eldest
shall receive one such share in excess’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 469), which adds an
explanation (for which see note on 112).
