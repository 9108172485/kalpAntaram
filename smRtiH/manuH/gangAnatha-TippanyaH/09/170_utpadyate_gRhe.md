This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 566);—which adds the
following notes:—‘*Talpaja*’, born of the wife;—the actual progenitor of
this child being unknown, it belongs to the same caste as its mother;
this is the case when there is no suspicion of the mother having had
intercourse with a man of a lower caste; in the case of there being such
suspicion, the child must he regarded as ‘born in the reverse order’,
and hence not capable of serving any useful purpose.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 541 and 557);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Vyavahāra 38a) and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 187b.)
