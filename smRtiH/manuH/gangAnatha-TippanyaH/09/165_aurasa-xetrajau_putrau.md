‘*Gotrarikthāṃśabhāginaḥ*.’—‘Become members of the *gotra* and also
inherit’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘share the family estate’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘they receive such share in the estate as will suffice for
their maintenance’ (suggested by Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 544), which adds the
following notes:—The first half of the verse is merely a reiteration of
what has been prescribed before; the ‘ten’, beginning with the ‘adopted’
son, in due order, *i*.*e*., each in the absence of the one
preceding,—become ‘*gotrabhāginaḥ*,’—*i.e*., ‘entitled to do all that
behoves a blood-relation’, as explained by Asahāyācārya,—and
‘*rikthāṃśabhāginaḥ*’, *i.e*., ‘entitled to inherit the father’s
property This rule refers to cases where there is no ‘body-born’ son,
nor ‘the appointed daughter’, nor the ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son;—in *Dāyatattva*
(p. 14);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 55 and 652).
