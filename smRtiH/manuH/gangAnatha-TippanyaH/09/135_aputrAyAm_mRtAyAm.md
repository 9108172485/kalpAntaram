‘*Dhanam*.’—‘What the appointed daughter received from her father either
during his life-time or on his death.’ (Nārāyaṇa).—But Kullūka says that
this prohibits the father inheriting the appointed daughter’s estate on
the plea that she was his ‘son.’—According to Nandana it precludes the
paternal uncle and other relatives from inheriting the property of an
appointed daughter.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p.754), which adds that this refers
to the case of the daughter who has been ‘appointed’ under the terms
that ‘the son born of this girl shall be mine’, and not to that of one
who is ‘appointed’ as herself being the ‘son’; in the case of the latter
the husband is precluded from inheriting her property, by Paiṭhīnasi.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 520), which adds that this rule is
meant for cases where the dead sonless daughter has no unmarried
daughter or sister;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 374), which adds
that this refers to cases where no brother-is born to the lady, oven
subsequently;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 742 and 765);—and by
Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga* p. 276), which says that this refers to cases
where a son has been born to the Appointed Daughter and has died.
