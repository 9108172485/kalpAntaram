This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 293), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Abhikhyāpya*,’ having got it proclaimed by the
people;—‘*sāra*’ stands for the stolen property; hence the meaning is
that the king should inflict the punishment in accordance with the
nature of the property stolen;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p.
79), which explains ‘*teṣām*,’ as ‘of the thieves,’ and adds the
explanation that ‘the king should inflict punishment in accordance with
the quality of the property stolen’.
