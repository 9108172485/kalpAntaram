‘*Ekāṃśaśca pradhānataḥ*’, ‘one most excellent share’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘one share consisting of the best part of the- property’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘one share, because of his being the chief
person’ (Rāghavananda).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 527), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kīnāśa*’ is the ploughman—‘*yānam*’, the horse and
the rest;—thus the meaning is that the son of the Brāhmaṇa mother
should, receive the plough man the cow, the bull, the conveyance, the
ornament and the house; and among the ‘three shares’ of the inheritance
to which he is entitled, one should be made specially important by
containing the most important and the most valuable things;—the cow and
bull etc. are to be given only if it be possible to do so.
