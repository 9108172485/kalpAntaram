This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 765), which explains
‘*paribhāṣaṇa*’ as ‘reproof’;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 222), which
explains ‘*paribhāṣaṇa*’ as reprimanding—‘don’t do this again’—without
punishment,—‘*shodhyam*’, *i.e*., by the person who committed the act
under urgent necessity;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 63), which
explains ‘*paribhāṣaṇa*’ as ‘warning *never do so again*’—without any
punishment—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 143b).
