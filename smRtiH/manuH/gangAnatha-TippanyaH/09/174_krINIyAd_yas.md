‘*Sadṛśo*’ *sadṛśo* ‘*pivā*’.—‘Equal or unequal, by good qualities, not
by caste’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘whether of equal or lower caste’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.131), which adds that ‘*sadṛśa*’
and ‘*asadṛśa*’ should be understood to be in regard to *qualities*, not
*caste*;—in *Aparārka* (p. 738), which also adds the same remark;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 570), which adds the following notes:—‘*Sadṛśaḥ*’,
of the same caste, ‘*asadṛśaḥ*’, of a different caste,—says the
*Pārijāta*; the author of the *Prakāśa* adds that even though the text
contains the term ‘*asadṛśaḥ*’ yet one should not buy a sou either of a
lower or a higher caste than his own;—and Medhātithi has said that
‘*sadṛśa*’ and ‘*asadṛśa*’ refer to sons of the same caster but of
*diverse qualifications*.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 653), which also explains
‘*sadṛśa*’ as referring to qualifications;—in the *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in *Vyavahāra* - *Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 557);—and *in
nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a).
