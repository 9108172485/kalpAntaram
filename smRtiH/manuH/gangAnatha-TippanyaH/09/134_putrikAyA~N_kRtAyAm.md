This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 541), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘*putra*’ here stands for the *aurasa*,
‘body-born,’ son;—‘*anu*’, after the ‘appointment’ of the
daughter;—‘*striyāḥ*’, of the ‘appointed daughter’; who the ‘appointed
daughter’ is, is described by Manu in verse 127.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.132) to the effect that when both the
sons—the body-born son and the son born of the ‘appointed daughter’—are
there, all the property is *not* to go to the former only. The
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that the meaning of the last quarter is that the
‘special portion’ ordained for the ‘eldest son’ does not accrue to the
‘appointed daughter’ or her son.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 739);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
347), which has the same note as the *Mitākṣarā*;—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 654);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 150);—in
*Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 51);—by Jīmūtavāhan (*Dāyabhāga*, pp. 223 and
67), as setting forth a reason why the Appointed Daughter should offer
the Ball through her son.
