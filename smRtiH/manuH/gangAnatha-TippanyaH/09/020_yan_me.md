“This verse is a slightly altered *mantra* which occurs in *Śāṅkhāyana
Gṛhyasūtra*’ 3.13.5, and in the *Cāturmāsya* portion of the *Kaṭhaka*
rescension of the *Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda*. According to the former, it has to
be recited by the ‘son of a paramour.’ But the *Kaṭhas* prescribe its
use by every sacrificer who offers a *Cāturmāsya* sacrifice.”—Buhler.

‘*Retaḥ*’—(*a*) ‘The semen of the legitimate husband, or (*b*) the
husband himself, or (*c*) the secretions of the mother herself’
(Medhātithi). \[In the case of (c) the word is in the accusative
case\];—‘secretions of the mother on her sexual desires being aroused’
(Kullūka, Govindarāja, Rāghavānanda, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

See also Āpastamba, Śrauta-sūtra 1.99 and Viṣṇu Smṛti 73.12.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 412), which adds the
following notes:—This quotes the Vedic text referred to in the preceding
verse; ‘*tat*,’ is the sin of desiring; aṇother man; the meaning thus is
as follows:—“Inasmuch as my mother entertained a longing for another
man, the sin due to this—may the ‘seed’ of my father remove; in ‘*pita*’
the nominative ending has the force of the genitive;”—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (*Vyavahāra*, 158b).
