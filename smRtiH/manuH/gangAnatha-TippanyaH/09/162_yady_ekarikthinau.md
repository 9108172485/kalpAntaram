Medhātithi has been mis-represented here by Kullūka and also by Buhler.
(See text). Nārāyaṇa and Nandana hold that the rule refers to the case
of two undivided brothers, where one having died, the other, who has
sons of his own, begets on the other a *Kṣetraja* son; in which case on
the death of the second brother, the *Kṣetraja* is entitled to receive
only the share of his mother’s husband, not any in the estate of his
natural father.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 543), which has the
following notes:—The ‘*Kṣetraja*’ meant here is one begotten by one not
‘commissioned’ (by the elders);—‘*paitṛkam riktham*’ means ‘that
property which the father gave to the mother for the purpose of
maintaining the son.’ Others however construe the verse as it stands, in
the direct, sense—‘Each takes the property of his own father.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 739), as laying down that the
*Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa-Kṣetraja* is entitled to inherit the property of his
progenitor-father.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 169), which explains the meaning to
be that each is to take the property of the man from whose seed he was
born;—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 229), which says that the son
shall inherit the property of that person from whose ‘seed’ he may he
horn.
