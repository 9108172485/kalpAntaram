“The designation ‘a corpse’ indicates that his father derives imperfect
benefits from his offerings (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda),—or
that he is blameable (Rāghavānanda).”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 574), which adds the following notes:—‘*Pārayan*,’
conferring some benefits upon the man whom he regards as his father,—he
is called ‘*śava*’ ‘corpse,’ because of his being capable of conferring
very little benefit upon his father;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (pp.
552 and 688);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra 38a);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 189b)—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 220), which says
that this refers to the son of a Śūdra woman who is *not a married
wife*.
