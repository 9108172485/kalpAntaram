This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 104), which says that this
refers to cases where no defects have been discovered in the
bride-groom;—in *Saṃskāra-ratnamālā* (p. 503), which has the same
note;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 218), which says that this
refers to cases where the bride-groom has no defects.
