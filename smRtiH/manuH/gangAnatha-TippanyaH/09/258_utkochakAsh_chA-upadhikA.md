‘*Aupadhikāḥ*’.—‘Deceitful persons, who say one thing and do another’
(Medhātithi);—‘those who extort money by threats’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘those who cheat by using false weights and measures’
(Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Vañcakāḥ*.’—‘Cheats, those who promise to do some thing but don’t do
it’ (Medhātithi);—‘those who pretend to change base metals into precious
ones’ (Rāghavānanda and Kullūka);—‘men who take money under false
pretences’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Maṅgalādeśavṛttāḥ*’.—‘Astrologers and others who prescribe auspicious
rites etc.’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘men who live by
reciting auspicious hymns’ (Nārāyaṇa);—“those who pronounce the
auspicious formula ‘be it so’.” (‘others’ in Medhātithi.)

‘*Bhadrāprekṣaṇikāḥ*’.—‘Palmists who always praise the fortunes of
others’ (Medhātithi);—Nārāyaṇa, reading ‘*bhadrāścekṣaṇikāḥ*’, explains
‘*bhadrāḥ*’ as ‘persons who tempt women’, and ‘*īkṣanikāḥ*’ as actors
and the rest;—Kullūka and Rāghavānanda and Nandana adopt the same
reading and explain ‘*bhadrāḥ*’ as ‘hyprocritical men who pose as pious
men and cheat people’ and ‘*īkṣaṇika*’ as palmists.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 291), which adds the
following explanations:—‘*Aikṣaṇika*’ (which is its reading for
‘*īkṣanika*’), is that fortune-teller who makes money by making false
agreeable predictions.
