*Cf*. 3, 23, 24, 51 and 52; 8.366;—9, 46, 71, 97 and 98;—11.62.

“*According to some people*, this verse does not form part of the text
of Manu”—says Medhātithi. This is not his own opinion, as Hopkins
wrongly asserts.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 772);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 149);—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 223);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 94), which explains ‘*śulka*’ as the *price*;—and in *Smṛtikaumudī*
(p. 38).
