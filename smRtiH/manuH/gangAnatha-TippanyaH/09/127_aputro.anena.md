This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 475) as a clear
indication that the ‘appointment’ of the daughter is undisputed in a
case where it has been done in accordance with a clear agreement between
the father of the bride and the bridegroom;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Vyavahāra 38a);—in *Vyvahāra-Balambhaṭṭī* (pp, 651 and 633) and by
Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 223), to the effect that the appointed
daughter offers the Ball to her appointing father through her son.

It is quoted in the *Vidhānapārījāta* (p. 699)—in the *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 561);—in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 182), as laying down the
mode of appointing the daughter;—in the *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 414), to
the effect that it clearly implies that there should be an express
stipulation with the girl’s husband;—in *Dattakamīmāṃsā* (p. 7);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 185a), which says that the son that is born
of the Appointed Daughter after stipulation, belongs to the father of
the girl; though the opinion has been held that this is so also in cases
where there has been no open stipulation to the effect.
