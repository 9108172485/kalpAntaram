“Kullūka and Rāghavānanda add that, as the son of Śūdra wife is
enumerated among the twelve, and not considered, like the son of
Kṣatriya and Vaiśya wives, a legitimate son, he inherits only on failure
of all other subsidiary sons.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 552), which explains
‘*Sadṛśāḥ*’ as ‘equal in qualifications’;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*
(pp. 555, 691 and 698);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 192a).
