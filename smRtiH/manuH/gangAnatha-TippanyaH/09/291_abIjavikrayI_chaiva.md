Buhler remarks “all the commentators give more or less correct
readings”,—and declares that the correct reading “seems to be”
‘*bījotkraṣṭā*’. This is amusing to read, when we find Medhātithi,
Nārāyaṇa, Rāghvānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra all adapting the reading
‘*bījotkraṣṭā*’.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 296), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Abījavikrayī*’, one who sells, as *seed*, com which
is unfit for sowing,—‘*bījotkarṣī*’, one who forcibly takes out the seed
that has been sown,—‘*maryādabhedakaḥ*’, one who transgresses the
customs of his country, caste and family, the scriptures and popular
practices,—‘*vikṛtam vadham*’, corporal punishment in the form of the
cutting off of ears and other limbs of the body.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 825), which explains ‘*abījavikrayī*’ as
‘one who sells as seed what is not seed’,—and ‘*bījotkraṣṭā*’ as ‘one
who digs out seed that has been already sown’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 81), which adds the explanation—‘He who (*a*) sells as
*seed* what is not *seed*, or (*b*) takes forcible possession of a field
sown by another, or (*c*) breaks a local or tribal or family custom, or
a scriptural or royal injunction, should have his ears and nose and
other limbs cut off.
