This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 549), which adds that the
diversity of opinion on this question among the various Smṛtis—as
regards the exclusion or inclusion of certain kinds of sons—is to be
explained as based upon consideration of the qualifications of the
sons;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 552, 666 and 687);—in
*Dattakacandrikā* (p. 61);—and in *Vīvādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 147).

Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take the latter half to mean that the
six sons are neither *bandhu* (*kinsmen*) nor *dāyāda* (*heir*); Kullūka
says that this explanation would be against the declaration of
Baudhāyana;—Nārāyaṇa goes on to explain ‘*bandhudāyāda*’ as ‘heir to the
kinsmen, *i.e*., inheritors of the estates of kinsmen, such as paternal
uncles, on failure of sons and wives of these latter.’
