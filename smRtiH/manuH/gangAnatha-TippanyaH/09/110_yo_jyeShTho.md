This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—The ‘behaviour of the eldest’ consists in lovingly
maintaining and taking care of the youngers;—‘*bandhuvat*’, like the
maternal uncle and other relations, he should be treated with respect,
and saluted and so forth, and he should not be treated
disrespectfully;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 513 and 691);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a).
