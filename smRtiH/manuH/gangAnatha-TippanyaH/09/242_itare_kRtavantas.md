Persons who perform no penance shall have their property confiscated if
the crime was unintentional, and if it was intentional, they shall be
banished also. (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).—There is to be confiscation of
the entire property only in very bad cases, instead of the fine of 1,000
*Paṇas* prescribed under 240. (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Pravāsanam*.’—‘Death’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and, Nandana); ‘banishment’
(Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānada, who criticise Medhātithi’s explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 635);—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 118).
