This verse occurs in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 542), which adds the
following notes:—The man, who takes care of the property and widow of
his brother who had separated from him, should beget a ‘*Kṣetraja*’ son
on that widow and make over the property to that son, he should never
take the property for himself.

It is quoted in the *Mitākṣarā*, (2.136), which says that the meaning is
that even when the brother is divided, if he dies, his widow is to be in
touch with his property only *through the child*, and not by her own
right The *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes.—‘*Bibhriyāt*’, should
take care;—‘*tameva ca*’ is another reading (for ‘*eva
taddhanam*’);—‘*taddhanam*,’ the brother’s property;—‘*tasyaiva*,’ to
the son;—the use of the word ‘*dadyāt*’ implies that the rule refers to
the case of divided brothers; as in the case of Undivided brothers,
there would be no property belonging separately to the dead brother.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 742), which explains ‘*tasyaiva*’ to mean
‘to the child only, *not* to its mother’;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 357), which adds that the meaning is that when a divided
brother has died, his widow can have anything to do with his property,
only through her child;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (Vyavahāra, p. 41a);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya*, (Vyavahāra 196a).
