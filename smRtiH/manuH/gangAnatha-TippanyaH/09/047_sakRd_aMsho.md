This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 490), which adds
that this rule regarding the betrothal of a girl pertains to cases where
the bridegroom to whom the girl has been betrothed has no disqualifying
defects;—in

*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 388), which adds that the
irrevocability of a partition here spoken of is meant for those cases
where all doubts regarding its fairness can be set at rest by reasonable
arguments;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 145), and again on p. 182, where it
is added that this irrevocability of partitions is meant for cases where
the partition has been made by the objector himself;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 218), which explains the first clause to
mean that ‘a man obtains his share in a property only once,’ and adds
that what is said in regard to the ‘girl’ applies only to those cases
where there is no defect in the bridegroom (to whom the girl has been
betrothed).
