This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 567), which adds that the
term ‘*saṃskriyate*’ stands for the rites of offerings etc. other than
those performed with *mantras* prescribed in connection with
marriage;—it quotes the opinion of others to the effect that the rites
meant are those laid down in the Atharvan texts:

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 189b);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 38);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 547 and 557);—and
in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 38a).

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 738);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra,
p. 742), which remarks that the ‘rites’ spoken of here are with a view
to just qualify the son thus born to serve as the ‘son’ of his mother’s
husband;—and it does not stand for the regular marriage-rites.
