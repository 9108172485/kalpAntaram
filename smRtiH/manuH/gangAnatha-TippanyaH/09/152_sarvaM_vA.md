“According to Nārāyaṇa this rule refers to the case where each of the
wives has several sons, while the preceding one is applicable where each
wife has one son only.—Rāghavānanda thinks that the first rule shall be
followed when the son of the Brāhmaṇa possesses good qualities, the
second when he is destitute of them”.—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 528), as containing the
sanction for partition with ‘special shares’ in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 353);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 212).
