title = "313 पराम् अप्य्"

+++
This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājaniti, p. 151), which adds
the following explanations:—‘*Parām āpadam*’ the w orst calamity,
brought about by the depletion of his treasury and by being attacked by
a more powerful King;—even though fallen in such, the king should not
‘provoke the Brāhmaṇas to anger’, by forcibly seizing their property or
by treating them with disrespect.

It adds that from 313 to 321, it is mere *Arthavāda*, and all that it
means is that even when a Brāhmaṇa commits an offence, he should not be
punished.
