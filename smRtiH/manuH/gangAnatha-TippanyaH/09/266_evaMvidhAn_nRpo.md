**(verse 9.264)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 336), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Apūpaśālā*’ is the place where cakes are
sold;—‘*veśa*,’ the house of the prostitute;—‘*madyānnavikraya*,’ places
where wines and grains are sold;—‘*caityavṛkṣa*,’ large
tree;—‘*samāja*,’ must be taken as standing for assemblages other than
the ordinary ‘*sabhā*’ or meeting place, this latter having been already
mentioned; such other assemblages also are likely to be frequented by
thieves; —‘*prekṣaṇa*’ are places of dancing and other amusements.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841).

**(verse 9.265)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 336), which explains ‘*Kārukāveśanāni*’ as the shops of artisans.

**(verse 9.266)  
**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 841);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 336), which adds the following notes:—‘*Gulmaiḥ*’, companies of
soldiers;—these are qualified by the epithet ‘*sthāvarajaṅgamaiḥ*’; the
meaning thus is ‘by companies of soldiers, located in a fixed place; as
well as, operating in moving columns’;—‘*cāraiḥ etc*.,’ for the
prevention of theft the king should have all possible haunts of thieves
watched by spies.
