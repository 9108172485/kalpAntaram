‘*Aprāptām*’—‘Who has not attained the marriageable age,’ (Medhātithi
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who has not attained eight years of age’ (Kullūka
and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 481), which
explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one whose marriage time has not arrived, *i*.
*e*., who is still a child’;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 124), which
explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one who has not attained the age that is most
commended for marriage’;—in *Vīramitrodya* (Saṃskāra, p. 755), which
reproduces the explanation of ‘*aprāptām*’ given in
*Parāśaramādhava*;—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 39), as countenancing the
marrying of a girl even before she is of the proper age;—in
*Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 30) to the same effect;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
103), which explains ‘*aprāptām*’ as ‘one who has not attained the right
age,’ who may be given away in consideration of the special
qualifications of the bridegroom.
