The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣavā* (2.136), which
remarks that this only means that the *king* shall not take the
Brāhmaṇa’s property, and *not* that even a son may not inherit the
Brāhmaṇa’s property;—again, to the effect that no part of the Brāhmaṇa’s
estate shall be an escheat to the king.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 675), to the effect that the
property of the *Kṣatriya* caste, in the absence of legal heirs, shall
go to the king, and not to the Brāhmaṇa;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
597);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 355) to the effect that on the
failure of legal heirs, the Brāhmaṇa’s property shall never go to the
king, while that of the other castes shall go to the king;—in
*Dāyakramasaṅgraha* (p. 12);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p.
41a);—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 338).
