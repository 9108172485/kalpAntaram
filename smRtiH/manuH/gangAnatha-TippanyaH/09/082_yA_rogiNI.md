This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 100), which adds that the
qualification ‘*sick*’ includes also the ‘barren’ wife, and ‘one who
gives birth *to* female children only’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
508), as laying down a special consideration in the case of the devoted
wife;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 872) which adds that ‘*hitā*’
is mentioned only by way of illustration.
