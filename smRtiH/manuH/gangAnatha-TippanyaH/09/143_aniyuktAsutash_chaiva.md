title = "143 अनियुक्तासुतश् चैव"

+++
This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Vyavahāra, p. 368);—and in
*Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 586), which adds the following
notes—‘*Aniyuktāsutaḥ*’ is the son begotten by the widow without the
permission of her elders;—‘*bhāgam*’ share in the property of the
husband of the widow;—this means that such a son is precluded from the
offering of *Piṇḍas* and other rites also. This refers to cases where
the widow has been bought over to the connection.
