This refers to a united family—as rightly remarked by Kullūka.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 507), which explains the
meaning to be that, if after the death of the father, the eldest brother
should happen to acquire some property by means of exceptional learning
or such other means, in that property the acquirer shall have two
shares, and each of the younger brothers one share, if they are devoted
to study.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.118), which notes the explanation of the
verse as that ‘on the death of the father, or even during the father’s
life-time, if any brother, eldest, youngest or the middle one, happen to
die, his shares are to go to the other brothers, and that, the
implication is that wealth obtained from friends and so forth is
partible’,—and then goes on to criticise it as unwarranted, and
concludes that the verse sets forth an exception to the general rule
that property acquired by each brother separately is impartible.

It is quoted by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p. 192), which adds that the
younger brothers are as much entitled to inherit the property of the
eldest brother as that of the father,—but with this difference that the
father’s property they inherit even when they are not learned, but to
the brother’s property only those are entitled who are learned.
