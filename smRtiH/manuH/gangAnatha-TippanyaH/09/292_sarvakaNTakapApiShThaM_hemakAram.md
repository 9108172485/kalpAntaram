This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 297), which adds that it refers
to cases where the gold belongs to a temple, or to a Brāhmaṇa or to the
king;—in *Aparārka* (p. 862), which remarks that it refers to the case
of a goldsmith stealing gold belonging to a Brāhmaṇa;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 309), which explains ‘*Kaṇṭaka*’ as an open thief,
and adds that people have held that the penalty prescribed being very
heavy, it must refer to cases of repeated theft;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 151b).
