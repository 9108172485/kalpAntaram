This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.139);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
678), to the effect that in the case noted there is no unequal
division;—in *Aparārka* (p. 748), which adds that this prohibits only
that unequal division, which is in the form of additional shares for the
eldest brother,—and not other kinds of unequal division; so that each
brother obtains, on partition, that part of the property which was his
when they entered into joint life.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 601), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Saha jīvantaḥ*’, living after joining together,—‘*samastatra
vibhāgaḥ*’, *i.e*., there is to be no additional share for the eldest,
and so forth.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 65), which mentions two
opinions—one, is that which has been set forth in *Aparārka*, and
another that there is to be absolutely equal division all round;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 41b);—by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyabhāga*, p.
342), which says that the equal partition is meant for brothers of the
same caste as the father;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 210a), which
explains the implication of the last clause to be that there is no
unequal division *due to seniority*, but there is unequal division on
other grounds.
