“According to Rāghavānanda the statement that the Kṣatriyas sprang from
the Brāhmaṇas is based on a Vedic passage. But Nārāyaṇa thinks that it
alludes to a Paurāṇika story, according to which the Brāhmaṇas produced
with the Kṣatriya females a new Kṣatriya race after the destruction of
the second *varṇa* by Paraśurāma.”—Buhler.

This verse is found in the Mahābhārata 5.15.34; 12.56.24.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 152).
