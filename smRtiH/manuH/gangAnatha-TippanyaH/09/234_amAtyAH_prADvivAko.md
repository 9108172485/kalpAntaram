“Medhātithi and Kullūka think that the rule refers to cases where the
cause of the unjust decision is not a bribe, because the punishment of
corrupt judges has been prescribed above, verse 231;—But Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda think that it applies to cases of bribery also, and that
the fine shall vary according to the nature of the case, 1,000 *Paṇas*
being the lowest punishment.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (65a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 38b).
