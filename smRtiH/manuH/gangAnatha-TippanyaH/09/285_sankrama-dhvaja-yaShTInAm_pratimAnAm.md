‘*Yaṣṭi*’.—‘The flag-staff of a village’ (Nārāyaṇa);—such poles as stand
in tanks and other places’ (Kullūka).

‘*Pratimā*’.—‘Statues of *men*, the penalty for breaking the image of
gods being death’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘common images made of clay and so forth’
(Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 363), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Saṅkramaḥ*’, bridge built of wood and other materials
for crossing over water, which is commonly known as ‘*Sāṅkham*’ (V. L.
*Sāṇk*);—‘*dhvaja*’, that which marks a temple or such other
places;—‘*Yaṣṭi*’, planted in market-places or tanks or
houses;—‘*pratimā*’, images of gods,—‘*pratikuryāt*’, should restore to
its former position.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 822);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p.
101), which adds the following notes—‘*Saṅkrama*’ is what is known as
‘*Sākama*’, ‘*dhvaja*’ is the *garuḍa-dhvaja* and like things dedicated
to some deity,—‘*yaṣṭī*’ is the post marking a
market-place,—‘*pratimā*’, image of some deity,—one who breaks any one
of these things should be fined 500;—and in *Prāyascittaviveka* (p.
247).
