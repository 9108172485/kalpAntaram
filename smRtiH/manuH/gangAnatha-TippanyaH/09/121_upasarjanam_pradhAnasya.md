‘*Pradhānasya*’.—‘The principal, body-born, son’ (Medhātithi);—‘The
father, the husband of the widow’ (Kullūka, Narāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

“The *subsidiary* son has not the same rights as the principal, his dead
father, the husband of his widow-mother; it is this father, the husband
of the widow, who is the ‘principal etc.,’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘the
father is the principal, not the mother, hence even though the mother is
the elder sister-in-law, yet the son does not have the same right as his
dead father’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 542) as supplying a reason
for what has been said in 120; it adds the following
explanation:—‘*upasarjana*’ is subsidiary, *i.e*., the *Kṣetraja*
son,—it is not lawful that this son should be treated like the
*principal*, the ‘body-born’, son; because in this case (of *niyoga*)
the father, the progenitor-uncle, is the ‘principal’;—such is the
explanation given by the author of the *Prakāśa*. Lakṣmidhara construes
‘*Upasarjanam*’ as ‘*Upasarjanatvam*’; but that makes no difference in
the meaning.—‘*Dharmeṇa*’, according to the injunction of the
scriptures.
