‘*Vipraduṣṭām*’—‘Blemished, by bodily defects’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka,
Rāghavānanda and Nandana); ‘belonging to a base family’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 492), to the effect
that it is not only the giver of a defective maiden that is to be
punished, but the girl herself is to be renounced in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 154), which adds the following notes:—‘*Vipraduṣṭā*’ is one who
entertains longings for another man,—‘*Chadmanā*’, by showing to the
bridegrom a girl other than the one to be married;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 744), which adds the following notes:—

‘*Vigarhitām*’, already previously married, but ‘impenetrated;’ it
quotes Medhātithi’s words as ‘*pūrvam pratigṛhītām akṣatayonimapi*’;
‘*vipraduṣṭām*,’ having her affections centred in another man;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 106), which explains ‘*vigarhitām*,’ as
‘defective’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 221), as laying down
the divorcing of a girl, after the detection of some defect in her,—it
explains ‘*vipraduṣṭām*’ as ‘*vividham prakarṣeṇa duṣṭām*,’ ‘having
*several serious* defects.’
