This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 291), which has the
following notes:—‘*Pracchannavañcakāḥ*’, those who commit burglaries by
breaking through walls and so forth;—‘*ātavyāḥ*’, thieves who frequent
the forests and commit thefts even during the day;—‘*ādi*’ is meant to
include the thief living in one’s neighbourhood and such others.
