“Rāghavānanda and Nandana point out that not only corporeal punishment
(according to verse 224), but also a fine may be inflicted,”—(Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 611), which explains
‘*yatheṣṭam*’ as ‘in accordance with the king’s wish’;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 153), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Yatheṣṭam*’ *i.e*. after duly examining the nature of the
guilt, whatever punishment,—corporal or monetary—the king decides to
inflict, that is to be regarded as lawful;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 880).
