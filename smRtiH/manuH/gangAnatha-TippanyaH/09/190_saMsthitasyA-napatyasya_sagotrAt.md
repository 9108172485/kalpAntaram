According to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, this verse refers to the case in
which a duly authorised widow bears a son to her husband through a
*sagotra*; and the former adds that this practice having been already
sanctioned under verse 59, it is mentioned here again with a view to
make it clear that the son may be obtained by the widow, not only “from
the younger brother-in-law or a Sapiṇḍa”, but also from a remoter
*sagotra*.—Nārāyaṇa holds the meaning of this verse to be that the son
that the widow bears, even *without authorisation*, to a *sagotra*,
shall inherit the property of the husband of that widow. He adds that
some people apply this rule to *Śūdra* females only.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 589), which adds the
following notes:—The widow of a deceased person should bear a son from a
‘*sagotra*’—*i.e. either from the younger brother-in-law or a
sapiṇḍa*—should make over the property owned by her dead husband to that
son, and she should not take it herself; such is the opinion of the
*Pārijāta*;—the author of the *Prakāśa* on the other hand holds the
meaning to be that the king himself should make the widow bear a son
through a *sagotra*, and hand over to him the father’s property;—the
final result of both the explanations is the same.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 742), which explains ‘*tasmai*’ (which is
its reading for ‘*tasmin*’) as ‘to that child’;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 758).
