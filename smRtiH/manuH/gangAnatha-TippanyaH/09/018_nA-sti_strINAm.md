The second half of this verse has been taken as a corruption of the line
“nirindriyā adāyādāḥ sthiyo (?) nityamiti sthitiḥ”. Hopkins
remarks:—“This is supported by the sūtras; *cf*. the text and quotations
given by Mandlik, *Mayūkha*, 2.366-367; also Baudhāyana, 2.3.46.”

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 412), which adds the
following notes ‘*Nirindriyāḥ*,’ devoid of the faculties conducive to
steadiness, truthfulness and so forth;—“*strīyonṛtam*,” women are called
‘untruth’ in the sense of bang addicted *to lying*,— and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 158b).
