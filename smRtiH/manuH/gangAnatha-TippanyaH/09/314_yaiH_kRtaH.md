This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 151), which
explains ‘*Brahma chaiva dhanam yeṣām*’ as that for the Brāhmaṇa the
Veda is the sole treasure, inasmuch as it is the Veda that accomplishes
all prosperity for them, and becomes the means of acquiring wealth by
teaching and sacrificing; and as such the Veda should be acquired and
guarded;—what man, wishing to live, shall give trouble to such
Brāhmaṇas?
