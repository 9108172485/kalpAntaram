8.98.]

“Medhātithi and Nandana say that the verse is meant to forbid marriage
of a girl whose betrothed has died. But Kullūka thinks that it refers to
all cases where a betrothal has taken place, and that it removes a doubt
which might arise through a too strict interpretation of 8.227.”—Buhler.

This verse in quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 326);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 220).
