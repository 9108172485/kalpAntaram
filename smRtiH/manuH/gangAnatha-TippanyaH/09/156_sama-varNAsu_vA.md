This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 532), which adds the
following explanation:—In cases where twice-born men have many sons from
several wives of the same caste as themselves ,—*or* (as indicated by
the term ‘*vā*’) many sons from several wives of diverse castes,—the
sons shall divide the property equally after having given something to
the eldest brother as his ‘additional share.’
