“This verse alludes to the Vedic text quoted, Vaśiṣṭha 17.1; Viṣṇu
15.43”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 457), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Sannayati*’, concentrates,—‘*ānantyam*’, endless
bliss,—‘*aśnute*’, obtains, *i.e*., becoming freed from
debt,—‘*Kāmajān*’, this is a mere exaggerated statement, because it
cannot be taken to mean that the younger sons have no share in the
paternal estate, since it has been distinctly declared that they do have
such share.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 163);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 656);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
43);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 172a);—by Jīmūtavāhana (Dāyabhāga, p.
37);—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 40b).
