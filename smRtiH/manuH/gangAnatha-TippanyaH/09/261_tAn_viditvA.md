‘*Protsādya*’.—Nārāyaṇa and Govindarāja read ‘*protsāhya*’ and explain
it as ‘causing them to be instigated’;—Rāghavānanda, who adopts the same
reading, explains it as “having inspired them with energy, by saying
‘you must give up this livelihood and earn money by agriculture, trade
and other lawful means’.”

‘*Anekasaṃsthānaiḥ*’.—‘Wearing various disguises’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘stationed in various places’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 293).
