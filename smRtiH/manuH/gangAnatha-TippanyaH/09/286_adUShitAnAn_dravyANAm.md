This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 362), which adds the
following notes:—For spoiling unspoilt articles by adulterating them
with defective articles,—for boring such gems as are broken by the
boring,—and for the wrong boring of pearls and such gems,—the fine is
the ‘first amercement’.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 821);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p. 100).
