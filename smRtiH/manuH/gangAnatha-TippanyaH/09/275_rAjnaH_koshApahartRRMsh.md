This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 853), which notes that ‘*rājñaḥ*’
is to be construed with each of the other terms;—again on p. 864, it
adds the following notes:—‘*Upajāpakāḥ*’ supporters,—‘*Vividhaiḥ
daṇḍaiḥ*’ *i.e*. every form of punishment should be inflicted in
accordance with the nature of the offence.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.302), which explains ‘*vividhaiḥ
daṇḍaiḥ*’ as ‘such penalties as confiscation of the entire property,
cutting off of limbs and death;’—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 367), which
explains ‘*koṣa*’ as the ‘king’s amassed wealth’,—and ‘*upajāpakān*’ as
persons creating dissension in the kingdom (among the *soldiers*,
‘*virāṇām*’ which is its reading for ‘*arīṇām*’);—in *Vyavahāramayūkha*
(p. 110);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahara, p. 395);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 991);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra
225b).
