‘*Agnidān*’.—‘Those who give fire to the thieves,—so that they may warm
themselves, or for similar purposes’ (Medhātithi),—‘so that they may put
fire to houses’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Moṣaṣya sannidhātṛṛn* (*sannidhātṝn*?)—‘Receivers of stolen goods’
(Kullūka);—‘abettors of theft’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 338), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Avakāśa*’, lodging,—‘*agni*’, fire as helping the act
of stealing,—‘*moṣaṣya sannidhātṛṛn*’, those who help in bringing about
conditions conducive to the stealing of property;—it adds that the cases
referred to are those in which the culprit has not been led either by
fear or by ignorance to do what he has done.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 849);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
991).
