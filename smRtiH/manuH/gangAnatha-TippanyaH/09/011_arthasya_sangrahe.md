This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 416), which explains
‘*pāriṇāhyasya*’ as ‘ear-rings, bracelets, and so forth’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 323);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 147),
which explains ‘*pāriṇāyya*’ (which is its reading for ‘*pāriṇāhya*’) as
‘bed-stead and other household furniture’;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
191).
