This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 365), which adds the
following notes—‘*Apsu*’, *i.e*., by drowning in
water,—‘*śuddhavadhena*’, by strangulation or such means of capital
punishment, apart from water;—the penalty of ‘highest amercement’ is to
be inflicted *along with* that of making him do the necessary repairs.
