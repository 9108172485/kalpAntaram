This rule refers to the case where the *Kṣetraja* was born before the
‘body-bom’ son, and received no property from his progenitor-father
(Rāghavānanda);—It refers to the case where a man dying leaving several
widows, one of those is ‘commissioned’ to bear a son, while another
gives birth to a ‘body-born’ son (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 543), which adds that the
option of ‘fifth’ and ‘sixth’ share is meant to be determined by the
presence or absence of good qualifications in the *Kṣetraja* son
concerned;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 348), which deduces the
following conclusion:—If the *Kṣetraja* son is endowed with
exceptionally good qualifications, he receives a fourth share; if he is
devoid of good qualities and also unfriendly to the ‘body-born’ son,
then only a sixth share; if he is only devoid of qualities, but not
unfriendly,—or if is he unfriendly but not devoid of qualities,—then a
fifth share,—and by Jīmūtavāhana (*Dāyahhāga*, p. 229).
