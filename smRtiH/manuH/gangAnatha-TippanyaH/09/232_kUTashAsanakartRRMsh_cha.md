This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 862), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Prakṛtīnām*,’ of the various ‘members’ of the
state;—‘*dviṭsevinaḥ*,’ those who serve persons disloyal to the
king;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 370), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Śāsana*’ here stands for royal proclamations;—‘*prakṛtīnām*,’
of the Minister and other members of the State;—‘*dūṣakān*,’ defamers
without justification, those who attribute delinquencies, when in
reality, there are none;—‘*dviṭsevinaḥ*,’ persons serving men inimical
to the king.
