‘*Kula*’—‘His own relations as well as the wife’s parental relations’
(Medhātithi);—‘either the family members or the public, according to
circumstances’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 69), which adds
that ‘casting off’ means ‘sending her to her father’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 288), which explains ‘*tyājyā*’ as
‘left among her own paternal relations, till such time as she is free
from her defects’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 59);—in *Aparārka* (p.
101), which explains ‘*kulasannidhau*’ as ‘*pitrādikulasannidhau*’, in
the presence of her father and other members of the family;—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 230);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 874), which
explains ‘*kula*’ as ‘her father and other relations’;—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 189).
