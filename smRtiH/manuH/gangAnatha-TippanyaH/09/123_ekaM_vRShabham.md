**(verses 9.122-123)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 473), which adds the
following explanation: The question here raised pertains to the case
where there are several sons born of several mothers belonging to the
*same caste* as the father; the term ‘*pūrvajaḥ*’ (in verse 123) stands
for the *younger son born of the senior wife*, as is clear from the
latter half of the verse; which means that the next best bullocks—those
not the very best—shall belong to those brothers who are ‘junior’ *by
reason of the junior position of their mothers*; *i.e*., whose mothers
are junior to the mother of the aforesaid

brother;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 461).
