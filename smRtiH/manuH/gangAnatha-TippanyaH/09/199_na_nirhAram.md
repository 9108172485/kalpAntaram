“Kullūka and Rāghavānanda take the first clause to refer to the property
of a united family, and the second to the separate property of the
husband.—But according to Nārāyaṇa and Nandana the translation should be
as follows:—‘Wives should never take anything (for their private
expenses) from their husband’s property destined for the support of
their families, over which many have a claim, nor from their own
property which is not *strīdhana*, without the consent of their
husbands’.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 509), which adds the
following notes:—The term ‘*Kuṭumba*’ stands for the *family-property*;
hence the meaning is that ‘out of the property that belongs to many
persons, women shall not make an extraction, withdrawal, without the
consent of the owners of that property’; similarly ‘*svakāt*’—*i.e*.,
out of the property that belongs exclusively to her husband, and not to
the other members of the family,—she shall not make an extraction
without the owner’s consent.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 69), which explains ‘*nirhāra*’
as *expenditure*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 215a), which
explains ‘*nirhāra*’ as ‘*vyaya*’.
