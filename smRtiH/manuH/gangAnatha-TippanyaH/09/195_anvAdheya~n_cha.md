According to Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka what is said here refers also to the
‘*strīdhana*’ described under 194.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 516), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Anvādheyam*’ is going to be defined later
on,—Halāyudha holds that this verse is meant to show that the husband
has no connection with the two kinds of property here mentioned, over
which the married woman has absolute right, even during her husband’s
life-time.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 70) as laying down the persons
who are to inherit the ‘*anvādheya*’ property of a woman;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 755 and 759);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra 216b), which explains the force of the locative in ‘*patyau
jīvati*’ to express disregard, the meaning being that the husband has no
lights over tìie property,—and adds that all brothers and sisters
(married as well as unmarried) are equally entitled.
