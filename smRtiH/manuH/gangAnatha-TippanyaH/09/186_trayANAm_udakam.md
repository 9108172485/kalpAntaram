According to Kullūka and Rāghvānanda the verse is meant to indicate the
right of the *kṣetraja* and other secondary sons to inherit the estate
of grand-father and others dying childless.—According to Nandana it
indicates the right of grand-sons and great grand-sons to inherit before
brothers and the rest.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 592);—in *Aparārka* (p.
744), as describing the ‘nearest sapiṇḍas’; the sense being that that
sapiṇḍa is the ‘nearest’ who makes water-offerings to the same persons
(father, grandfather and great-grandfather); so that the uterine brother
would be the ‘nearest’; the son of the uterine brother would he one step
removed, as his ‘father’ would be different;—still one further removed
would be the brother’s grandson, as his ‘father’ and ‘grandfather’ would
both be different; so on with the others.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 134), to the effect that the
father, the grandfather and the great-grandfather, irrespective of their
wives, are the ‘*deities*’ (*i.e*., recipients) of the water and other
offerings;—and again on p. 195;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
655);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 198b);—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(*Dāyabhāga*, pp. 157 and 253).
