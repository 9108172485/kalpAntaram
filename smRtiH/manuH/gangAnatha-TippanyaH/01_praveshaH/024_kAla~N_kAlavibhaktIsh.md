*Medhātithi* (p. 19, 1. 21)—It is interesting to note that even so late
as Medhātithi’s time, the Lunar Mansions were counted from *Kṛttikā*
onwards, and not from *Aśvinī* as in the more recent astronomical
systems. (See Thibaut on ‘Indian Astronomy’ in *Indian Thought Vol. I*.)

This verse is quoted in the *Gadādharapaddhati* — *Kālasāra*, p. 5, as
describing the creation of time and its divisions;—also in the
*Kālamādhava* (p. 45) as describing the creation of time by God; it
reads ‘*vibhaktim*’ for ‘*vibhaktiḥ*.’
