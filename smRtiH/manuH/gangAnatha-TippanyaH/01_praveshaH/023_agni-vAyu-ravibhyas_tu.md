title = "023 अग्नि-वायु-रविभ्यस् तु"

There are two explanations of this verse, supplied by Medhātithi:—(1)
‘For the sake of the accomplishment of the sacrifice to Agni, Vāyu and
Sūrya, He produced the Veda,’ and (2) ‘Out of Agni......He produced the
Veda’;—the latter being preferred, for reasons adduced in the *Bhāṣya*.

Burnell has a curious note here to the effect that—‘This myth of the
creation of the Vedas differs from the Sāṅkhya account, *according to
which they are eternal and issue from Brahmā’s mouth*.’ It was necessary
to supply references to the work on Sāṅkhya here referred to.

*Medhātithi* (p. 19, 1. 9) ‘*Asmindarśane*’—etc. This refers to the
passage in the *Mahāhhāṣya* (Nirṇayasāgara edition, ‘Vol. II, p. 265, l.
18).

A similar use of the Ablative ending we find in 2. 77.

Do. (p. 19, l. 11) ‘*Dohanañchādhyāpanam*’—In this case *ravibhyaḥ*
would be the *Dative* form.
