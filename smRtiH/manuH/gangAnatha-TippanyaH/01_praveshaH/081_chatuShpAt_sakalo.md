Dharma with its ‘four feet’ is a common idea in Hinduism. In VIII. 16 we
have the picture of Dharma as a ‘bull’; its ‘four feet’ have been
variously identified:—(*a*) according to Medhātithi, they represent the
four principal sacrificial priests—*Adhvaryu*, *Hotṛ*, *Brahman* and
*Udgātṛ*;—(*b*) he also suggests, along with Nandana, that they may
stand for the four castes;—(*c*) they have been held by Medhātithi,
Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa to stand for the four means of acquiring
merit—*Tapas, Jñāna, Yajña* and *Dāna*;—(*d*) and last, they have been
identified by Medhātithi with the four kinds of speech described in
*Ṛgveda* 1.164.45—‘Three being hidden in the cave and the fourth being
spoken by men.’

‘*Satyam*’—Though included in ‘*Dharma*,’ this has been mentioned
separately, for the purpose of showing its special importance. The
*Aparārka* (p. 1012) quotes the first line of this verse as showing the
diverse character of the various cycles.—The verse is quoted in the
Vīramitrodaya—Parībhāṣā, p. 50.
