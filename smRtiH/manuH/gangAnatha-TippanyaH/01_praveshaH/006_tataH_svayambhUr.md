‘*Mahābhūtādī*’—Here again Rāghavānanda, the Vedantin, is at variance
with the other commentators, and takes it in the sense of ‘*Akaṅkāra*,’
and not in that of ‘the Elemental Substances &c,’

‘*Prādurāsīt*’—‘assumed a body of his own free will, not in consequence
of his *Karma?*: (Medhātithi, Kullūka, Govinda, Nandana);—‘became
discernible’: (Nārāyaṇa)—‘became ready to create’: (Rāghavānanda)

The reader should refer to the latter portion of the *Bhāṣya* on verse
11, where the present verse is explained as setting forth the
self-evolution of *Prakṛti*, according to the *Sāṅkhya*.
