‘*Manūn*’—The name ‘Manu’ here stand for *that Being* whose function it
is to create all creatures and to maintain the entire world during a
*manvantara*, and apparently belongs to the *office*. Some Mss. read
‘*munīn*’.

‘*Devanikāyān*—‘Classes of gods’ (according to Nandana and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘abodes of gods’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda); the
last of these suggests also the meaning ‘servants of the gods’.
