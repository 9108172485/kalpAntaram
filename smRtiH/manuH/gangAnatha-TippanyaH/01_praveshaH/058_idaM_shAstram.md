‘*Vidhivat*’—‘With due attention’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja);—‘according to rule,—with due ceremonies’ (Kullūka).

In connection with the authorship of the Smṛti see *Bhāṣya* (Printed
edition, Gharpure, p. 7) and also Buhler’s Introduction p. xv. Burnell
in his footnote on Verse 58, misrepresents Medhātithi, by imputing to
him a view which he has put forward only as held by ‘some people’
‘*Kechit*’.

Parāśara-mādhava (Ācāra—p. 106) quotes this verse in support of the view
that the Smṛtis are the work of Brahmā; and it adds that—‘as Brahmā, so
Svāyambhuva Manu also, compiles the Duties that have been ordained in
the Veda;—which establishes the beginningless and immutable character of
*Dharma*.’
