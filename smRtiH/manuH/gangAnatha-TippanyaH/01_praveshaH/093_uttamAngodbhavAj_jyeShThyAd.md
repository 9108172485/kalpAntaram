‘*Dharmataḥ prabhuḥ*’—‘The lord, by law’—according to Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana. But Medhātithi takes it to mean that ‘*he is the lord, in
matters relating to Dharma*’; *i.e*., he is the person entitled to
prescribe the duties of men and as such, is like the lord;—Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda accept the latter explanation.
