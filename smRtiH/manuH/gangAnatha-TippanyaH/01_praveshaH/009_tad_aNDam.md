Burnell remarks that this ‘Egg’ does not belong to the Sāṅkhya
philosophy. The explanation of this, in accordance with that philosophy,
is thus given by Medhātithi, under verse 11—‘*Sarvataḥ pradhānaṃ
pṛthivyādibhūtotpattau kāṭhinyameti aṇḍarūpam sampadyate*.’

*Haimam*—The commentators are agreed that this is used figuratively, in
the sense of *pure* or *brilliant*.

*Jajñe svayam Brahmā*—(a) ‘He himself was born as Brahmā’, or (b)
‘Brahmā himself was born.’

There has been a great deal of confusion in the mind of modern scholars
in connection with the ‘Golden Egg’,—much of which would have been
avoided if the figurative character of the term had been recognised.

*Medhātithi* P. 11. l. 22 ‘*Anidamparebhyaḥ*—& c.’—Cf. what has been
said in the Bhāṣya on verse 5, to the effect that ‘the process of
creation here described is in some places in agreement with the Purāṇas,
while in others, in accordance with the doctrine of the Saṅkhyas.’ It is
this want of consistency that has led Medhātithi to regard the whole of
this discourse as purely ‘*arthavāda*.’
