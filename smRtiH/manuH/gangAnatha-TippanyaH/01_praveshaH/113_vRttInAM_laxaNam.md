expert in the science of reasoning;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 77 4), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Hetukaḥ*’ (which is its reading for
‘*haitukaḥ*’), expert, in inference;—‘*tarkī*’, one who is expert in
‘*Tarka*’, which is the name given to that process of reasoning by which
one comes to the correct conclusion on a definite question, by rejecting
all other possible alternatives; the ‘*tarka*’ ‘argumentation’ meant
here is one that does not go against the Vedic scriptures.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 199), which adds the following
notes—‘*Traividyaḥ*’, one who knows the three Vedas,—‘*haitukaḥ*’, one
who acts in a reasonable manner;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 22).
