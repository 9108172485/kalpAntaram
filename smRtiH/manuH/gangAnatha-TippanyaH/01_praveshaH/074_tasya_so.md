Of the second half of the verse, two explanations have been mentioned by
Medhātithi and Kullūka: (1) ‘on waking from sleep, Brahmā creates the
*Manas* (*i. e*., the *Mahat*)’; and (2) ‘He employs his own *Manas*
(Mind) in creating die world’. Govindarāja adopts the latter explanation
only; Nārāyaṇa and Nandana accept the former only. Nandana takes
‘*Manas*’ as standing for *Mahat, Ahaṅkāra* and *Manas*,—and *Sadasadāt*
*makam* as ‘*prakṛtivikṛtyātmakam*’.
