‘*Bhūta*’—here stands for the *Kṣetrajña*, the Conscious Being ensouling
the body—according to Govindarāja and Kullūka.

‘*Nityam*’—qualifies ‘*ghore*’; ‘Ever terrible’ according to Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, the last, along with Nandana, however,
suggests the reading ‘*nitye*’ meaning ‘in this eternal samsāra.’
