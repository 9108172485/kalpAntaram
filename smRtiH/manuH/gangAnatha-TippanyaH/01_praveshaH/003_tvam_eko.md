‘*Vidhānasya svayambhuvaḥ*’—Buhler has translated this phrase to mean
‘the ordinance of the self-existent’,—evidently taking ‘*Svayambhuvaḥ*’
as standing for God. This, however, is incompatible with the
interpretation of all the commentators, according to whom
‘*Svayambhuvaḥ*’ is in apposition to ’*Vidhānasya*’,—the phrase meaning
the ‘self-existent ordinance’, ‘the Eternal Law’ (the Veda). Burnell is
more to the point when he renders it as ‘self-existent system.’
Medhātithi (p. 5) has suggested another explanation—‘activity handed
down by immemorial tradition.’

‘*Aprameyasya*’—Though other commentatoss are satisfied with rendering
this epithet as meaning ‘unfathomable,’ Medhātithi imparts to it a
special significance by explaining it as ‘not directly knowable, but to
be inferred, as the foundation of the Smṛti.’

‘*Kāryatattvārtha*’—‘the purport and nature of the soul’ (Kullū.)—‘the
true purport’ (Medhātithi, Govinda and Nandana)

It is noteworthy that Medhātithi has supplied, under verse 11 below, a
totally different explanation of this verse.
