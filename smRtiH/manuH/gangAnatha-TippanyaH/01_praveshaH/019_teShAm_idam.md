The ‘seven’ are made up of—

\(1\) Egoism, the five subtile elements and the Mahat (Medhātithi,
Govinda and Kullūka);—(2) *Ātman* instead of *Mahat* (Nārāyana and
Nandana). Medhātithi notes another enumeration suggested by ‘others’—(1)
The five organs of Perception, (2) the five organs of Action and (3),
(4), (5), (6) and, (7) the five grogs elemental substances.’

The name ‘*puruṣa*’ has been applied to the Tattvas, Principles,—because
‘they serve the purposes of the, soul’ (Medhātithi),—or because ‘they
are produced by the Puruṣa, Ātman,’
