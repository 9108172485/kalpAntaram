‘*Kṣetrajña*’.—Nandana is misrepresented by Buhler; he also takes the
word in the sense of the *jīvātmā*.

‘*Bhūtātmā*’.—The body (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kūlluka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘The soul in the form of the material substances and
other non-sentient things’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the sense-organs, and the rest’
(Nandana, who is again misrepresented by Buhler).
