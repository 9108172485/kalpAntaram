The ‘Virāṭ’ whose birth is here described is, according to some, the
same as,—and according to others, different from—the ‘Brahmā’ described
above, in verse 9. That Medhātithi leans towards the latter view is
indicated by his assertion that what happened was that ‘the body of
Brahmā (described in verse 9) now took the form of the
Hermaphrodite,’—or as he adds later, ‘the Female form was separated from
His own Male form.’
