‘*Quarter by quarter*’—The natural meaning is that men lived for 400
years during *Kṛta*, 300 years during *Tretā*, 200 years during
*Dvāpara* and 100 years during *Kali* But in view of the assertion in
the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad* of a man having lived for 1600 years (3.16.17)
Medhātithi has been forced to remark that ‘quarter’ here stands for
*part*, and not for the precise *fourth part*, and to explain the text
to mean that ‘man’s life becomes shortened *in part*; some die while
they are young children, others on reaching youth and others on
attaining old age.’

The *Aparārka* (p. 1012) quotes the first line in support of the view
that each cycle has a distinct character of its own.
