Medhātithi forces the Sāṅkhya doctrine on Manu, whose words clearly
favour the *Vaiśeṣika* view.

The words clearly mean ‘From out of Ākāśa, undergoing modifications,
proceeds Vāyu.’ But Medhātithi construes them to mean—‘After Ākāśa—(from
out of Mahat) which undergoes modifications—proceeds Vāyu &c.,’—in order
to make it agree with the Sāṅkhya doctrine that Vāyu, like every other
elementary substance, proceeds from Mahat.
