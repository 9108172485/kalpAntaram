‘*Sandhyā*’—it is not clear whether the *succeeding* or *preceding*
twilight is meant. Kullūka, and possibly Medhātithi, accepts the former
view.

*Medhātithi* (p. 34, l. 24) for ‘*Svabhāvānuvṛttiḥ*’; how would it do to
read ‘*Svabhāvānanuvṛttiḥ*’—the meaning being that the preceding
Twilight has the character of neither Day nor Night?
