*Āpo nārā* &c.—This explanation of the name ‘Nārayaṇa’ is found in
[Viṣṇu Puraṇa
I](/hinduism/book/the-viśnu-purana-2/d/doc115935.html "English translation by Horace Hayman Wilson"),
and also in the [Mahābhārata,
3.189.3](/hinduism/book/the-mahabharata-third-book/d/doc7469.html "English translation by Kriśna-Dwaipayana Vyasa").

It is curious that Medhātithi reads ‘*narāḥ*’ (instead of ‘*nārāḥ*’) and
adds a somewhat forced explanation of the elongation of the initial
vowel in ‘nā’.

*Medhātithi* P. 12, l. 6—*Babhrumaṇḍuloniakāḥ*—These apparently are
three other proper names—‘Babhru’, ‘Maṇḍu’ and ‘Lomaka’,—which stand on
the same footing as ‘Vaśiṣṭha.’
