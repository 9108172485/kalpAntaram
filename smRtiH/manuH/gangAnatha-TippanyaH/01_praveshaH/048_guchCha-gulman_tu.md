Burnell represents Medhātithi to explain ‘*guccha-gulma*’ as ‘one root
and many roots’. This is not fair. What Medhātithi says is that the
names ‘*guccha-gulma*’ are applied to clusters of short-growing creepers
which may have one root or several roots.’ Kullūka defines ‘*guccha*’ as
the single shoot springing from the root and having no boughs, and
‘*gulma*’ as a clump of shoots coming up from one root According to
Medhātithi the difference between the two consists in the fact that
while the former has flowers, the latter has none.
