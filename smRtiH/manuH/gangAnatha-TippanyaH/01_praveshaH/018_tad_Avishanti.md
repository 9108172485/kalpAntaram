Buhler supplies the translation of the verse according to the five
interpretations offered by the commentators.

1.  The text here represents the explanation given by *Medhātithi*:—
2.  According to *Govinda* and Kullūka the verse means—‘From Brahman are
    produced the gross elements, together with their functions, and the
    Mind, which is the producer of all beings through its minute
    portions, and imperishable’.—
3.  According to *Rāghavānanda*—‘That gross body the gross elements
    enter, and the Mind, which is the producer of all beings and
    imperishable, together with the actions and with the limbs.’—
4.  According to *Nandana*—‘As that body of Hiraṇyagarbha, though
    through its small portions it produces all beings, ye tis
    imperishable,—even thus the Great Beings and the Mind, with the
    actions enter it.’—
5.  According to *Nārāyana*—‘That subtile body the gross elements enter,
    together with the *Karma* and the Mind, the producer of all beings
    and imperishable, together with its minute portions.’

Dr. Buhler’s rendering of this verse is not approved by Hopkins. The
construction of the sentence is the same in all cases—*mahānti bhūtāni
karmabhiḥ saha—manaśca sūkṣmaiḥ avayavaiḥ*.

Medhātithi himself offers a second explanation.
