The ‘day’ and ‘night’ of Pitṛs is regulated by the Moon, just as those
of gods and men is by the Sun.

This verse has been quoted in the *Kālaviveka* (p. 112) in support of
the view that the seasons and other calculations are not governed by the
‘Lunar Month,’—which only serves the purpose of being the ‘Day-Night’ of
Pitṛs; the darker fortnight being their ‘day,’ and the brighter
fortnight ‘night’.

The same work quotes it again on p. 308, in support of the view that
‘from *Pratipat* to *Amāvāsyā* is the dark fortnight, and from
*Pratipat* to *Purṇamāsi* is the Bright Fortnight.’
