title = "103 विदुषा ब्राह्मणेनेदम्"

+++
This verse is quoted in the *Mitākṣarā* (on I, 3)—along with another
verse from Manu (2-16)—in support of the view that, though all the three
twice-born castes are entitled to *study* the *Dharmaśāstra*, the
Brāhmaṇa alone is entitled to teach it. In support of this it also
quotes a text from *Śaṅkha* to the effect that the Brāhmaṇa alone is
entitled to these, and it is he that explains their duties to the other
castes. To this same view we find the verse quoted in the Vīramitrodaya
(Saṃskāra, p. 512);—also in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 10) which
reads *vidvadbhiḥ* for ‘*śisyebhyaḥ*’ and explains it as meant simply to
exclude the Śūdra only.
