This verse is quoted in Hemādri—Pariśeṣa—Kāla, p. 657, where ‘*Tapas*’
is explained as ‘Kṛcchra, Cāndrāyaṇa etc.,’ and ‘*jñāna*’ as ‘*dhyāna*’
‘meditation’;—in the Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣā, p. 48;—in the
*Smṛticandrikā*—Samskāra, p. 27, which explains ‘*par* *am*’ as ‘the
most important;’—and in the *Kṛtyasārsamuccaya*, p. 80.
