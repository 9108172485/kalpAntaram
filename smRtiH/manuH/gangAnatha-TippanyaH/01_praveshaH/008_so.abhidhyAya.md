\(3\) *Abhidhyāya*—According to those who interpret the process here as
‘described in accordance with the *Saṅkhya*’, this means ‘independently
of all outside force, just as a man does an act by mere thought.’

*Āpaḥ*—In his eagerness to be literally faithful, Buhler has translated
this as ‘*waters*’, using the plural form in consideration of the plural
form of ‘*āpaḥ*’ in the plural. It has to be borne in mind, however,
that the text has used the plural form, because the base ‘*ap*’ has no
singular form at all.

*Vide*, in this connection, *Ṛgveda*, 10.121.1, and [Viṣṇu-purāṇa
I](/hinduism/book/the-viśnu-purana-2/d/doc115935.html "English translation by Horace Hayman Wilson").

*Saḥ*—Hiraṇyagarbha (acc. to Medhātithi); the Paramātman (according to
others.)

*Abhidhyāya*—According to the interpretation of ‘others’, noted by
Medhātithi, under verse 11, this participle means ‘independently of all
external activity, just as a man may do some act by merely willing it.’

*Medhātithi* P. 11, l. 6—‘*anyebhya idamucyate*’—This is an idiomatic
expression used in the sense—‘This that is urged is spoken, as it were,
to others—it does not concern us,—it has no hearing upon what we have
said.’
