**(verse xviii)**

Medhātithi notes two explanations of this verse.

The natural meaning appeal’s to be that ‘each being continues, in each
succeeding Birth, to betake itself to the same function that was
assigned to it in the beginning by Prajāpati.’

But this being incompatible with the law of Karma, which has been
regarded as adumbrated by Manu in I. 41,—Medhātithi has tried his best
to get out of the words the meaning that the conditions and activities
of each being are ordained in accordance with his past deeds;—but the
only argument that he puts forward in support of assigning this meaning
is that the literal meaning of the words would give rise to a number of
undesirable contingencies. According to Medhātithi, creation is due to
the joint action of the three causes—(1) the being’s past acts (2) God’s
will and (3) Evolution of Prakṛti.

The confusion of thought in regard to the exact meaning of this and the
following two verses is further shown by the fact that Medhātithi (p.
22, l, 27 under verse 30) has thought it necessary to set forth ‘another
explanation’ of these texts.
