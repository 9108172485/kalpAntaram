‘*Deśadharma*’—is *local custom*, *e.g*. the ‘*Holāka*’ or Holi
festival, which is peculiar to ‘North India’; and there also it is
observed in different ways in different parts of the country.

Burnell—‘It is worth while to compare the twelfth lecture with the
first, on which it throws considerable light.’

This has been improved upon by Hopkins who, with a transcendent insight
peculiar to a certain well-known sect of orientalists, opines the ‘whole
character’ of the first lecture ‘as that of a later prefix to the work.’
It is really a treat to see how far people are carried away by their
eagerness to say something ‘new.’

One fails to see the logic of the argument that, because the first
lecture contains much more mingling of philosophical views, therefore it
must be a later prefix. It would indeed be more logical to expect the
‘later prefix’ to be more accurate and lucid than what has preceded it!
In fact the whole trouble regarding the first Discourse has arisen from
the efforts made by commentators—Sanskrit and English—to read in the
verses a systematic account of one or the other of the two well-known
systems of the ‘Sāṅkhya’ and the ‘Vedānta’. Hopkins himself finds it
‘difficult to bring such verses as 53 ff. into harmony with the Sāṅkhya
doctrine.’ But has Manu himself anywhere told him that he was expounding
things in accordance with the ‘Sāṅkhya doctrine’? It does not appear to
be fair to impose a doctrine upon the writer and then to take him to
task for not being in harmony with that doctrine.
