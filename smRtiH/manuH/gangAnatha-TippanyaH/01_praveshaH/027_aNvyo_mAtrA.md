‘*Vināśinyaḥ*’—because liable to change into gross substances
(Medhātithi, Govinda and Kullūka); or because they are *products*
(Rāghavā.)

The commentators are at some pains to explain the incongruity of the
inter-position of the present verse in the middle of what purports to be
a connected account of the process of creation. Medhātithi says the
verse serves the purpose of summing up what has been said so
far;—Govindarāja and Kullūka make it serve the purpose of setting aside
the notion that the creation was accomplished by Brahman without the
help of the ‘principles’;—and Nārāyaṇa holds that it is meant to lay
stress upon the non-eternality of atoms;—Nandana has solved the
difficulty by placing this verse after verse 19.
