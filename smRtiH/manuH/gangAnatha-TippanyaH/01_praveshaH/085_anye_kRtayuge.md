title = "085 अन्ये कृतयुगे"

Buhler translates the verse to mean that the diversity of *Dharma* is
due to the *decrease in the length* of the yugas. This however is not
countenanced by any of the commentators, all of whom agree that the said
diversity is due to the relative *inferiority* of fine age to the other.

Medhātithi’s interpretation of 85 is not quite consistent with what
follows in 86; but he has taken care to disconnect 85 from 86; he
distinctly says that what is said in 86 is a ‘diversity in the character
of the yugas’ distinct from what has been set forth in 85. Really this
is made clear by the fact that in 85, the word ‘*Dharma*’ stands,
according to Medhātithi, not for duty, but for *characteristic*.

This verse is quoted in Hemādri—Pariśeṣa—Kāla, p. 657;—and in the
Smṛticandrikā—Saṃskāra, p. 27.
