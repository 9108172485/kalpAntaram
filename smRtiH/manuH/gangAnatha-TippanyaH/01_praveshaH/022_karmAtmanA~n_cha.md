The meaning of this verse, which Buhler attributes to Medhātithi, is one
that the latter has not put forward at all. His explanation is somewhat
different, as will be clear from the translation. He has however noted
an explanation by ‘others’, which is rightly rendered by Buhler as—‘The
Lord created the multitude of the gods whose nature is sacrifice and of
those endowed with life.’—According to Rāghavānanda it means—‘The Lord
created among beings endowed with life the (to us) invisible multitude
of the gods who, by the result of their acts, have obtained their divine
station, or who subsist on offerings.’
