*Six elements*—The five Rudimentary Substances and the Principle of
Egoism.

Here also, and for reasons similar to the above, there is a difference
of opinion among commentators.

Nandana, and Rāghavānanda take the verse as describing the creation of
the *bodies* of things from the *body* of the Creator, and that of their
*souls* from His Soul.

The ‘six’, Rāghavānanda takes as standing for the six sense-organs, and
Nandana as for the six *tattvas*—

1.  Mahat,
2.  Ahaṅkāra,
3.  Manas,
4.  Subtile Elements,
5.  Organs, of Action
6.  and Organs of Sensation.

Medhātithi takes the verse simply as describing how the Creator created
all beings by combining ‘the subtile components of the said six
principles’ with ‘their own evolutes.’

Hopkins remarks that ‘*ātmamātrā*’ stands for ‘the *spiritual* atom as
opposed to the *elementary*,—not reflexive *elements of himself*.’
