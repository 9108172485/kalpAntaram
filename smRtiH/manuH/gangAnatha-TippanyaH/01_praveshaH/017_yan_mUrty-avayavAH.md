Nandana explains the verse to mean that ‘the body of *Hiraṇyagarbha* is
called *Śarīra*, body, because it enters all things mentioned in the
preceding verses by means of its portions’; according to Medhātithi on
the other hand, it means that—the body of *Pradhāna* is called *Śarīra*,
because its six components enter into these things,—*viz*., the organs
and the elemental substances. Kullūka refers it to the body of Brahman.

The only important points of difference are—(1) while Medhātithi takes
it as referring to the body of Pradhāna, others take it as refering to
that of Hiraṇyagarbha or Brahmā; and (2) while according to Medhātithi
the evolutes entering into that Body are the organs and the gross
elemental subtances, according to Nandana, they are only the six
principles named in verses 14-15.

The natural construction of the verse appears to be *yat (yasmāt
kāraṇāṭ) sūr?yacayacāḥ sūkṣmāḥ tāni imāni ṣaṭ āśrayanti tasmāt*——as set
forth by Medhātithi But if *tāni imāni* refers to *indriyāṇi* then there
should be an accusative ending in in order to make it the object of
*āśrayanti*. It is in view of this difficulty that the Bhāṣya has put
forward *another* construction by which *sūkṣmāḥ* is the nominative and
*tānīmāni* the objective of the verb *āśrayanti*,
