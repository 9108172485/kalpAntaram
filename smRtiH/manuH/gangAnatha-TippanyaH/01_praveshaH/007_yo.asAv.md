*Sūkṣmaḥ*:—‘unperceivable by the external senses’: (Kullūka). But this
would be a repetition of *atīndriyagrāhyaḥ*’; hence Govinda renders it
as ‘who is perceivable by subtle understanding only;’ and
Rāghavānanda—‘who is without parts’—which is, as Kullūka makes out to
be, the meaning of ‘*avyaktaḥ*.’

*Sarvabhūtamayaḥ*—Medhātithi has offered two explanations: (1) ‘entirely
taken up by the idea of creating tilings’, and (2) ‘whose modification
all tilings are’. The latter explanation is practically accepted by all
the commentators.

*Udbhabau*—‘Assumed a body’: (Medhātithi and Govinda) or ‘shone forth’
(alternative suggested by Medliātitlii); ‘appeared in the form of the
products’: (Kullū.)—‘became discernible’ (Nandana).

*Medhātithi*, P. 10, l. 7—‘*Tathā ca Vaiśeṣikāḥ*’;—The sūtra quoted is
Gautama’s *Nyāya-sūtra*, 1.1.10. It seems that even so early as
Medhātithi’s time ‘*Nyāya*’ and *Vaiśeṣika*’ were used as convertible
terms.
