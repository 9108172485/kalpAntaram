‘*Lokavivṛddhyartham*’—‘in order that the inhabitants of the worlds
might *multiply* (or *prosper*)’—(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘in order to protect the world by means of the castes, and to
make it prosperous’ (Nārāyaṇa).

It is refreshing to find Medhātithi regarding this account of the castes
issuing from the mouth and other parts of the body of the Lord as mere
‘*stuti*’—not to be taken as literally true.
