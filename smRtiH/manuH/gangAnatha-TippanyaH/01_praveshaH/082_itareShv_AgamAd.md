This verse also has been variously interpreted:—(*a*) According to
Medhātithi it means that during the *Tretā, Dvāpara*, and *Kali* cycles,
‘Dharma fell off from the scriptures, foot by foot, and that there was
deterioration foot by foot in the fruit of Dharma also,—the reason for
this latter fact lying in the prevalence of theft, falsehood and fraud
*during all these three cycles*’; and he emphasises the fact that theft
eta, are not to be token as pertaining to the three cycles
respectively;—(*b*) according to Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the
meaning is that during the three cycles, *by reason of unjust gains*
(‘*āgamāt*’) Dharma successively loses one foot etc., eta;—(*c*)
Govindarāja agrees with Medhātithi, hut with this difference that he
appears to favour the view that the deterioration in the results of acts
is due to theft, falsehood and fraud *respectively*,—the view that has
been repudiated by Medhātithi;—(*d*) according to Nandana—‘it having
been declared in the preceding verse that in the Kṛta-cycle there were
no scriptures, it is now said that during the other three cycles, Dharma
*is* determined by the scriptures,—and it diminishes successively in
each age by one quarter.’

This verse is quoted in the Vīramitrodaya—Paribhāṣā, p. 50.
