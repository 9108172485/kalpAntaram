Burnell remarks—“According to the commentators the translation should
run thus: ‘The four Yugas just reckoned (consisting of) twelve thousand
years are called a *Yuga* of the gods.” This is the translation adopted
by Buhler also. What is not quite accurate is the statement that such a
translation is “according to the commentators”,—when we find that
according to Medhātithi at least, the meaning of the verse is as it is
represented by Burnell in his text. Medhātithi says
explicitly—‘*dvādaśa-chaturyuga—sahasrāṇi devayugam nāma kāla
ityarthaḥ*’.

In face of the fact that the words of the text themselves convey this
meaning—which involves the ‘lengthening’ of the ordinary into divine
years,—it is difficult to understand Burnell’s remark that this
‘lengthening’ ‘is the work of commentators.’ On the contrary, on
Burnell’s own showing, the ‘commentators’ would appear to have
*shortened* the great length of the divine year clearly expressed by the
words of the text.
