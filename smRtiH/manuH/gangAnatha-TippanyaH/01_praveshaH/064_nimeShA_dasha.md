‘*Nimeṣa*’—(1) The time taken by one wink of the eye, or (2) the time
taken in the distinct pronouncing of one syllable.

‘*Tāvaṭaḥ*’—in the Accusative necessitates the supplying of the
Transitive verb ‘*vidyāṭ*,’ ‘one should know’. Nārāyaṇa and Nandana
however favour the nominative form ‘*ṭāvanṭaḥ*’ which obviates the
necessity of adding any words.

*Cf*. in this connection Wilson’s Viṣṇu-Purāṇa—Ed. Hall, Vol. I, pp.
47-50.
