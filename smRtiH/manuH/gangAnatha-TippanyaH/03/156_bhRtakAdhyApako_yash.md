‘*Vāgduṣṭaḥ*’—‘who speaks rudely and falsely’ (Medhātithi);—‘who speaks
rudely’ (Kullūka);—‘one who is accused of a serious offence’ (‘others’
mentioned by Medhātithi, and Kullūka.)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds that ‘*vāgduṣṭa*’ is ‘one of rude speech’;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 481);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains
‘*guruḥ*’ as ‘preceptor *of* *the Śūdra*,’ and ‘*vāgduṣṭaḥ*’ as ‘of
harsh speech’;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).
