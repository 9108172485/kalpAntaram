This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 863), where it
explains ‘*Brāhmaṇī*’ as ‘the girl married in the Brāhma form;’ and adds
that the term ‘*pitṛn*’ includes the son and other descendants
also;—also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 487);—in *Aparārka* (p. 88),
which explains ‘*Sukṛta*’ as ‘doing what is enjoined and avoiding what
is forbidden’;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 683); and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 227).
