‘*Kitavaḥ*’—‘The keeper of a gambling house’ (Medhātithi);—‘one who
makes others play for himself’ (Govinda-

Medhātithi and Kullūka note the other reading ‘*Keka* *raḥ*’, explaining
it as ‘squint-eyed’, and connecting it with the ‘drunkard.’

*The translation on p. 183, ll. 1-3 should run as follows, and not as
printed*:—“*Some people read* ‘*Kekaraḥ*’ for ‘*kitavaḥ*’ *and make it
qualify* ‘*madyapaḥ*’; *the* ‘*kekara*’ *is* ‘*the man with a squint*’.

‘*Kātaraḥ*’ is yet another reading noted by Medhātithi, who explains it
as ‘one, the pupils in whose eyes are like the parrot’s feather, green’.

‘*Rasavikrayī*’—‘One who sells poison’ (Medhātithi);—‘one who sells
substances used for flavouring food, *e.g*., sugarcane-juice and the
like’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the seller of molasses’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 087), which reads
‘*Kekaraḥ*’ and explains it as ‘squint-eyed’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
481);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha p. 9);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*
(p. 40), which explains ‘*kitavaḥ*’ as ‘gambler’, and ‘*rasavikrayī*’ as
‘dealer in salt and such other articles’.
