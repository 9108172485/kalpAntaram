This verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 169);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1021), which explains ‘*veṣṭitam*’ as wrapped up by turban
etc.;—the specific prohibition of facing the south implies that when
there is scarcity of room one may eat facing any other quarter but the
south,—‘*upānahau*’ are foot-covers of leather (shoes).

“The same verse in the Mahābhārata ends: *Sarvam vidyāt tadāsuram*
(13.90.19), ‘belonging to the Asuras’.”—Hopkins.
