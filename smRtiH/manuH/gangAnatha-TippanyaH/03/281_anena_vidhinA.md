‘*Vārdhrīṇasa*’—‘An old goat, white and with long ears reaching the
water at the time of drinking’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a black-necked, red-headed, white-winged crane’
(Nārāyaṇa).

Both these explanations are noted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706),
where, however, the colour of the goat is mentioned as *red*, not
*white*. The definition of the goat quoted by Medhātithi is here
attributed to *Viṣṇudharmottara*, and that of the crane to the
‘*Nigama*’.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 295), which adds the
definition of *Vārdhrīṇasa* as *white*;—and the first half in *Aparārka*
(p. 551), which explains ‘*pāyasa*’ as ‘rice cooked in milk’, and adds
that this milk should be such as is not forbidden.

It is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536), which supplies the
description of the *Vārdhrīṇasa* as given in the *Nigama*—‘(a) The old
goat whose ears and mouth touch the water, who has lost his virility;
(b) the bird which has black neck, red head and white wings’.
