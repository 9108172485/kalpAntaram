‘*Brāhmaṇam bhikṣukam*’—‘The Brāhmaṇa that arrives as a guest, and the
Brāhmaṇa that comes begging for alms’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka);—‘the Brāhmaṇa householder, and the ascetic that begs for food’
(Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 728) in support of
the view that ‘after the invited Brāhmaṇas have been seated, if a
Religious Student or an Ascetic should happen to turn up, he also should
be fed at the *Śrāddha*’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 500);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha, p. 246);—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 521);—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 439).
