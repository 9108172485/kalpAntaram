‘*Bhikṣave brahmacāriṇe*’—‘To the Religious Student who begs for it’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘to the Remmciate *and* to the Religious
Student’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda; also suggested, but disapproved, by
Medātithi);—‘the chaste beggar’ (*third* suggestion by Medhātithi and
approved on the ground that it includes all the three,—the Student, the
Hermit and the Remmciate).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
392) as laying down that the feeding of the guests is to be done after
the Bali-offerings; but adds that this is meant for those cases where
the *Śrāddha* is not performed, as in the case of the Householder who
has his father still living;—also on p. 434, where it explains that what
is meant by ‘*Pūrvamāśayet*’, ‘should feed *first*’, is that the feeding
should be done *before the Nityaśrāddha*, and applies to those cases
where the ‘guest’ happens to arrive at that exact time.
