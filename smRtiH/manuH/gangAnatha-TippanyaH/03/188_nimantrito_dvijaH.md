title = "188 निमन्त्रितो द्विजः"

+++
This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 456);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 1014), which adds the following notes:—The Brāhmaṇa invited at
Śrāddha should keep himself self-controlled, *i.e*., should keep himself
free from sexual intercourse and also keep the other restrictions;
Medhātithi

says that the obeservances laid down for the Accomplished Student, the
avoidance of dancing and music, &c. are all meant to be kept; the
meaning is that the inviter should see to it that the invited keeps
these restrictions:—‘*Chandāṃsi*’ Vedas;—‘*adhīyīta*’, ‘utter the words
of the Veda’; the *Japa* of texts is not prohibited:—the performer of
the *Śrāddha* himself also is to observe these restrictions; the role is
meant for both the inviter and the invited.
