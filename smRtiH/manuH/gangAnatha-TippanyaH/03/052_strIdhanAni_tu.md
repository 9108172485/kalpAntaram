This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 851), which
deduces from the word ‘*lobhena*,’ ‘through greed,’ the conclusion that
if something is received *without greed* on the part of the father, it
is not the ‘*price*,’ but only an *honorific present* to the bridegroom;
and in support of this it quotes Manu 3.54;—in *Vyāvahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*
(p. 761);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 232);—and by Jīmūtavāhana
(Dāyabhāga, p. 151).
