This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 356), which explains
‘*dūrāt parīkṣā*’ as ‘investigation regarding his ancestors and
character’; and ‘*pradāne*’ as ‘in the matter of other gifts also’ he
should be honoured like a guest;—in *Aparārka*, (p. 437), which explains
‘*dūrāt parīkṣā*’ as ‘investigation regarding his father and several
degrees of ancestors,’—‘*tīrtham*’ as ‘the way for the running of
water,’ the implication being ‘just as water runs smoothly along its
path, so do the offerings easily reach the Pitṛs, through the qualified
Brāhmaṇas’;—the man is called ‘*atithi*’ in the sense that he is of
immense help to the Householder;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 34),
which explains ‘*dūrāt*’ as ‘in regard to their remote ancestry,’ and
‘*tīrtha*’ as ‘fit recipient.’
