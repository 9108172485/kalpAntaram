This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 487);—the first
half is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 863), where the term
‘*daivoḍhāja*’ is explained as ‘one born of a wife married in the Daiva
form’; and it is added that the phrase ‘*ātmānañca*’ of the preceding
verse has to be construed here also;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 683);—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228), which explains ‘*Kāya*’ as the
Prājāpatya.’
