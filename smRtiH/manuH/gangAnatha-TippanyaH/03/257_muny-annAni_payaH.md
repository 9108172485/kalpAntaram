‘*Anupaskṛtam*’—‘Not forbidden’ (Medhātithi);—‘not prepared with spices’
(Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘not dressed as usual’ (Nandana);—‘not
tainted by bad smell’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 225), which explains
‘*anupaskṛtam*’ as ‘of such seasonings as are brought about by cooking
&c.’ It rejects the explanation of Kullūka (‘free from bad smell’) on
the ground that the word can have no such meaning;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
500), which explains it as ‘what has not been cooked for some other
purpose’—and again on p. 551, as enumerating what is *haviṣya*;—also in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 541 and 573);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
4220), which explains ‘*anupaskṛtam*’ as ‘not rotten’, ‘not foul
smelling’,—*Soma* as the juice of the Soma-creeper;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 538).
