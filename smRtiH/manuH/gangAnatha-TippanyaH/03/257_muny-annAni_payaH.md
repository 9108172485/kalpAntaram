This verse, as quoted by Medhātithi on p. 290, l. 1, reads
‘*Asapiṇḍa*’.—But the same sense may be got out of the reading
‘*Āsapiṇḍa*’.—See *Translation*.

“The *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa*, the solemn reception of a dead person among the
partakers of oblations, is performed either on the thirteenth day, or a
year after death,”—says Buhler. But the rite is performed on the
*twelfth*, not the *thirteenth* day.

Hopkins has misunderstood the signification of the *Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa* rite.
He calls it ‘ceremony on making a Sapiṇḍa (relative) for him’ and adds
that ‘it implies that the deceased died without any family to offer the
Śrāddha for him.’

As a matter of fact, this rite is performed for every one; and its
meaning is as explained by Buhler (see above).

The second half of this verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 802) in
support of the view that the ‘Śrāddha’ and ‘offering of the Ball’ are
two distinct acts.
