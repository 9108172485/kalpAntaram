This verse is quoted in *Kālaviveka* (p. 527) as forbidding the
performance of *Śrāddhas* at night;—in *Smṛtitattva*, on p. 172, and
again on p. 266 as precluding certain times for the performance of
Śrāddhas;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 373);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
586), which says that the night is excluded because *Rākṣasas* stalk

about at night, so that if Śrāddha were offered at night, the Rākṣasas
would take it away; it should also not be done either in the morning or,
in the evening twilight;—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 37), which explains
‘*Surye achirodite*’ as within three *muhūrtas* of sun-rise;—in
*Kālamādhava* (p. 157);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 329);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 305), which explains ‘*surye &c*.’ as ‘during
the first *muhūrta* of the sunrise, which is forbidden in reference to
Śrāddha only;—in *Suddhikaumudi* (p. 194);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
329);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 20b).
