This verse is quoted in ‘*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 652) in support of
the view that ‘even though it may not be possible for the performer to
find a spot sloping towards the south from himself, he should try and
make it slope southwards;’—in *Smṛtitattva* (page 107) in the sense that
the performer should sit on a place that has been previously smeared
with cowdung;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 483), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*shuchim*’—*i*.*e*., a sacred place, which is by itself
clean; or a place in his own house, which should be free from all
foreign sources of uncleanliness;—‘*viviktam*’ *i*.*e*., free from hairs
and other unclean things;—and the place should be beaten into a slope
towards the south—*i*.*e*., capable of allowing the performer to pour
offerings towards the south.

This is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 268);—in *Aparārka*, (p.
471), which explains ‘*vivikta*’ as ‘*vijana*,’ ‘not crowded by men;’
and adds that even though the place be clean, it should be smeared over
with cowdung for the purpose of imparting to it special sanctity;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 160);—and in *Śraddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 102).
