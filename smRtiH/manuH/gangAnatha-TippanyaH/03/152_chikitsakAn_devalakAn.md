title = "152 चिकित्सकान् देवलकान्"

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which omits
the second half of this and the whole of the next verse, though
continuing with verse 154;—the whole verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 560);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 480).

*Parāśaramādhava* (on p. 689) adds the notes that the ‘*chikitsaka*’ is
‘one who administers medicine either gratuitously or by way of
living,’—this work being specially forbidden for the Brāhmaṇa,—the
‘*Devalaka*’ is ‘one who, for three years, worships the gods as a means
of making money,’ such being the definition provided by a text quoted
from Devala,—the ‘*Māṃsavikrayī*’ intended to be excluded is one who
sells meat, *even in abnormal times of distress*,—because as regards
*normal times*, living by any kind of trade is forbidden by the next
phrase, which prohibition does not apply to abnormal times, during which
the ‘livelihood of the Vaiśya’ has been permitted for the Brāhmaṇa.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 450), which explains that the
‘*Chikitsaka*’ means one who makes a living by administering medicines,
not one who does it by way of charity;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
40).
