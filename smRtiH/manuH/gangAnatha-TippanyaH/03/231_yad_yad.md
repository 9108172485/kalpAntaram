This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 542), which, in explaining
the phrase ‘*pituḥ svanāma saṅkīrtya*,’ says that in offering the
Ball—to his own great-grandfather, *e.g*., he should refer to him as
‘the grandfather of my father, so aṇd so’;—also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p.
362) in support of the view that if the grandfather be living, the
offerings; should be made to the Father, the great-grandfather and the
great-great-grandfather;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 553), which
notes that ‘*nāmakīrtaṇa*,’ ‘mentioning of the name’ stands for
‘offering the Śrāddha’ and ‘*prapitāmaha*,’ ‘great-grandfather’ means
the ‘great-great-grandfather’ also.
