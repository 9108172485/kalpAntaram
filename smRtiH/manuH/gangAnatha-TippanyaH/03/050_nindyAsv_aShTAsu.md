‘*Yatra tatrāśrame vasan*’—‘In whatever life-stage he may be’; *i.e*.,
‘whether he be a householder or a hermit *Vānaprastha*’ (Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa).—According to Medhātithi, this is a mere *arthavāda*, and what
is said does not apply to any one except the householder;—Govindarāja
does not, like Kullūka, restrict the extension to the Hermit
(*Vānaprastha*) only, he includes the Renunciate (*Yati*) also. Buhler
remarks that ‘Kullūka justly ridicules the last opinion’; but Kullūka’s
own opinion is only a shade less ridiculous than Govindarāja’s. (See the
following note, for a good explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 559), where the
foilwing notes are added:—‘*Nindyāsu rātriṣu*’—on the first four days,
the, eleventh day and the thirteeenth day;—‘*anyāsu ratriṣu*—on any
other eight days from among those not forbidden;—if one avoids
women,—*i.e*, approaching them only on two days,—the man remains ‘a
continent religious Student’;—*i.e*., he derives the results obtainable
by continence;—‘*Yatra tatrāśrame*’—*i.e*., even though he is a
Householder, he gets all that is obtainable by the chaste Student.
