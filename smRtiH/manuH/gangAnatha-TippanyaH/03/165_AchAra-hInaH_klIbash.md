This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds the following notes:—‘*Kuśīlava*’ stands for ‘singers and
others,’—‘*Vṛṣalīpati*’ is ‘the husband of a girl who attained puberty
before marriage;’—that person also is to be excluded in whose house a
paramour of his wife’s lives constantly;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
481);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains ‘*Kuśīlavaḥ*’
as ‘dancer’.
