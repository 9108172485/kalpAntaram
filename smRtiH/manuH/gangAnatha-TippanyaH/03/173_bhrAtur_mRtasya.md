It is interesting to note that Medhātithi states that “some people have
held that the present verse does not form part of the text at all.”
(*Trans*, p. 194).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 452) as providing a definition of
‘*didhiṣūpati*’ as distinct from that provided by *Devala*, according to
whom he is the husband of the girl whose younger sister is married
before her;—and it adds that the implication of the definition itself is
that such a person is to be excluded.
