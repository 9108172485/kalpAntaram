This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 432), where the
following notes are added:—‘*Pāñcayajñike*’ means ‘at that *Pitṛyajña*
which forms part of the Five Great Sarifices;’—the particle ‘*api*’
implies that, if possible, one should feed several Brāhmaṇas also;—the
second half of the verse means that ‘*Viśvedeva-Śrāddha*’ does not form
part of ‘*Nityaśrāddha*’, in support of which it quotes a text from
*Bhaviṣya Purāṇa*;—also in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1565).
