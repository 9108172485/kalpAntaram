Two of these technical terms occur in the beginning of Baudhāyana’s
*Gṛhyasūtra*, and four in Pāraskara’s *Gṛhyasūtra* 1.4.1, as well as in
Śāṅkhāyana’s 1.5.1.

This verse is quoted, without comment, in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
392);—and in *Aparārka* (p. 142), which adds that these are the names
for the ‘five sacrifices.’
