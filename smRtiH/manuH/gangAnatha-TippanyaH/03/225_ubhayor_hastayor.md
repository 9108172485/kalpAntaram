This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 439);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1368), which explains the meaning as ‘the food that is not brought by
both hands is taken away by force’ (‘*sahasā*’) by the wicked
(*duṣṭacetasaḥ*) ‘Asuras’;—in ‘*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*’ (p. 158), which
explains ‘*ubhayorhastayormuktam*’ as ‘(brought) with only one
hand’;—and in ‘*Gadādharapaddhati*’ (Kāla, p. 545).
