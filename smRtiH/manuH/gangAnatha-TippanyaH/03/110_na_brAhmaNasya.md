This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 355) in support of
the view that—‘if a guest comes to one’s house with a view to getting
food, and goes away without getting any, then all the rites that the
master of the house performs, in honour of the Gods and the Pitṛs,
become futile.’

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), which adds the
following explanations:—‘*Śilāt*’ (which is the reading it adopts)—‘from
the remnant of the gleanings dropped in the
fields.’—‘*uñchataḥ*’—‘pickings’;—what is meant is that even a poor man
should entertain his guest.
