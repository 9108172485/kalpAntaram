This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 354) in support of
the view that in the house of the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and others are
not to be entertained as regular guests, they are only to have food
offered to them in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 438) to the effect that
wherever the term ‘Brāhmaṇa’ is used in the texts laying down the duty
of entertaining a ‘guest’, it is meant to exclude the *Kṣatriya* and
other castes;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 428).
