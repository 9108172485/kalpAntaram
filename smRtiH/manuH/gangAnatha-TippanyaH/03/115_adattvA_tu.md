This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455) without
comment; and also on p. 395, where it is explained as setting aside the
view that the *Vaiśvadeva* and *Bali* offerings should be made only once
in the morning when the man himself eats,—and as indicating the
necessity of making them both in the morning and in the evening, *even
though the man himself may not eat* at both times. There is this
difference, however, that if the man omits the offerings while he
himself eats, he incurs two sins—that of eating without offering, and
that of omitting the offerings; whereas if he drops them when he himself
does not eat, he incurs only one sin, that of omitting the offerings.
Thus on the *Ekādaśī* and other fasting days also, the said offerings
have got to be made; and food has got to be cooked for that purpose; but
in the event of his being unable to do the cooking, the offerings may be
made even with uncooked food.

This is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 147), which explains the second
line to mean ‘he does not understand that he is himself being devoured
by dogs and vultures’, and deduces the conclusion that it is not sinful
to eat along with the persons mentioned in the preceding verse.
