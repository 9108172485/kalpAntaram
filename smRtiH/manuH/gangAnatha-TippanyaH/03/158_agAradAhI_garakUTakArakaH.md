‘*Agāradāhī*’—‘An incendiary; as also (according to Nandana) one who
burns corpses for money’.

‘*Kuṇḍāśī*’—‘One who eats the food of the son of an adultress’
(Medhātithi and Kullūka) ‘the glutton who eats sixty *palas* of rice’
(Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Kūtakārakaḥ*’—‘The perjuring witness’ (Medhātithi, Rāghavānanda and
also Kullūka, whose explanation does not differ from Medhātithi’s as
noted by Buhler);—Medhātithi explains the word as ‘*Sākṣyeṣvanṛtavādī*,’
and Kullūka as ‘*Sākṣivāde mṛṣāvādasya-kartā*’;—‘any one who commits
fraud, *i.e*. a forger, a falsifier of weights and measures’ (Nārāyaṇa
and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687) without any
comment;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha, p. 9a).
