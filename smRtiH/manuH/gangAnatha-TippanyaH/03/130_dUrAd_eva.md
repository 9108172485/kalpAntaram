“According to one opinion, given by Medhātithi, and according to
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa, this rule is a limitation of verse
119, and means that the two persons mentioned shall not receive the
‘Honey-mixture,’ except when they come dining the performance of a
sacrifice, however long a period may have elapsed since their last
visit—According to another explanation, mentioned by Medhātithi, and
according to Nandaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the verse means that a King and a
Śrotriya, who come, after a year since their last visit on the occasion
of a sacrifice, shall receive the *Madhuparka*.—The term ‘*Śrotriya*’
refers, according to Medhātithi, to a *Snātaka* or to an officiating
priest;—according to ‘others’ quoted by him, to all the persons
mentioned in the preceding verse;—according to Govindarāja, Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, to a *Snātaka*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455) in support of
the view that *Madhuparka* is to be offered to a King only if he is also
a ‘*Śrotriya*,’ ‘learned in the Veda’, not otherwise;—‘*Śrotriyaḥ*’
being taken as qualifying ‘*rājā*.’—It is difficult to see how the
writer will construe the term ‘*Sampūjyau*’ (in the dual number).
