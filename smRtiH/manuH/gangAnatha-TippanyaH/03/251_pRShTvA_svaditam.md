This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 472), which explains
‘*avaravarṇajaḥ*’ as ‘Śūdra’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 576);—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 521), which explains ‘*avaraja*’ as Śūdra,
and explains the meaning to be that ‘the things should be removed far
enough so that the wind etc. may not reach the food.’
