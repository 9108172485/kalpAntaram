This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 850) in support of
the view that if the ‘cow-pair’ given by the bridegroom in the *Ārṣa*
marriage is accepted, not in greed,—then it is to be looked upon only as
a means of honouring the bride, and not as a ‘price’ paid for her. It
explains the word ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 156) also quotes it in support of the view that if
the ‘cow-pair’ is accepted on behalf of the bride, there is nothing
wrong in it,—the verse being explained as follows—That ‘consideration’
which is accepted on behalf of the bride, constitutes the ‘honouring’ of
the girl, and as such is not sinful;—*i.e*., the ‘consideration’ thus
received should be handed over to the girl.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 100), which explains
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘honest dealing’;—in *Saṃskā raratnamālā* (p. 479)
winch explains ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 233), which explains the meaning as ‘what is received as
fee for the girl, that is only a *present* to the bride,’—and is
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’, ‘nothing sinful.’
