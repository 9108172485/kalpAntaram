‘*Pṛṣṭhavāstuni*’—‘On the upper storey, or on the roof of the house’
(Medhātithi);—‘behind the house’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘outside
the house’ (Nandana);—‘behind the offerer’s back’ (Kullūka).

‘*Sarvānnahhūtaye*’—‘The same deity occurs in Śāṅkhāyana, *Gṛhyasūtra*,
2.14, where Professor Oldenberg has *Sarvannabhūti*, while the
Petersburg Dictionary gives *Sarvānubhūti*”—Buhler.

Medhātithi denies that there is any such ‘deity’ and he is averse to
assuming any such unheard of deity, when the literal meaning of the term
is not incompatible with the text,—‘for the acquiring of all kinds of
food.’ Kullūka, however, who reads ‘*Sarvātmabhūtaye*’ takes it as the
name of a deity.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where the
following explanations are added:—*Pṛṣṭhavāstuni*’ means ‘behind the
house, in the place where the urinal is situated’;—‘*Sarvānubhūti*’ is a
deity of that name;—‘*haret*’ means ‘should offer’.
