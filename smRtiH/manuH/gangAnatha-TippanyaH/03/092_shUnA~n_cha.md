This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 342), which adds
that the object of the verb is ‘*annāni*’ understood;—in *Smṛtitattva*
(p. 424) in support of the view that (a) wherever such offering is laid
down as to be given to ‘*birds*’, it is the *crow* that is meant
(evidently the author adopts the reading *Vāyasānām* for *Vayasām*), and
that (b) in texts laying down such offerings to the ‘unfit’, it is
persons afflicted with ‘filthy diseases’ that are meant;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 316) as laying down the offering of food outside
the house;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where ‘*Śanakaiḥ*’ is
explained as ‘in such a manner as no food may be wasted,’ which adds
that the offering made for the benefit of ‘crows’ and others should be
put in places where they may be of the greatest use to them;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.103, p. 75);—in *Aparārka*, which adds that the
‘*patita*’ here is meant to include such sects of mendicants as go about
with human skulls in their hands;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 286) as
laying down the ‘offering to Bhūtas, living creatures’.
