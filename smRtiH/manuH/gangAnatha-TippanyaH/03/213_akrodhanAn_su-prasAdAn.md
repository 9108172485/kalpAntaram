Burnell is not right in saying that “Medhātithi omits verses 213-14.”

‘*Purātanān*’—‘Those deities born in this cycle who are called
*Sādhyas*’ (Medhātithi, who adopts this reading only as an alternative,
his own reading being ‘*purātanāḥ*’ explained as ‘the ancient sages’ and
construed as nominative to the verb ‘*vadanti*’);—‘Those whose
succession has been uninterrupted since immemorial times’ (Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘Those who were produced before all other
castes’ (Nārāyaṇa)
