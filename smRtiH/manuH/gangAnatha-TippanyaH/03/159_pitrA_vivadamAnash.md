This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 556), which explains
‘*parīkṣeta*’ as ‘make an investigation regarding their learning and
conduct’;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 287);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p.
6b);—in *Hemādri*, (Śrāddha, p. 510);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
34) as meaning that the testing in the case of *Pitṛkṛtya* is to be more
thorough than in that of *Devakṛtya*.
