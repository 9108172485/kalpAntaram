‘*Ucchīrṣake*’—‘Head of the bed’ (‘Others’in Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana);—‘the North-East portion of the house, where the head of the
Vāstupuruṣa lies’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘the place of
the head, well-known as the *Devatāśaraṇa*’ (the N.-E. corner of the
house is what is meant).

‘*Pādataḥ*’—‘the lower portion of the house’ (Medhātithi);—‘the South
West corner of the house, where the Vāstupuruṣa has his feet’
(Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), which explains
‘*Ucchīrṣahe*’ as ‘the head of the bedstead lying in the house’—and
‘*Pādataḥ*’ as ‘the foot-end of the bedstead in the house’, and adds
that the formula to be used in making the offering should be as put in
the text ‘*Brahmavāstoṣpatibhyām svāhā*.’
