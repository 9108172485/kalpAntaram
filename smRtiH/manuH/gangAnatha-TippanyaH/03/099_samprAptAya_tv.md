This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), which explains
‘*samprāptāya*’ as ‘one who has happened to come of his own accord, *i*.
*e*., without invitation’; and ‘*vidhipūrvakam*’ as ‘in the manner
prescribed for the entertaining of guests’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 433).

Between verses 99 and 100, *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441) quotes the
following two additional verses—

> annaṃ hutvā vidhānena yatpuṇyaphalamaśanūte \|  
> tena tus?yaṃ viśiṣṭaṃ vā brāhmaṇe tarpite phalam \|\|  
> mantr?akarmaviparyāsād? duritād? durgatādapi \|  
> tatphalaṃ naśyate karturidaṃ na śraddhayā h?tam \|\|

and adds the following explanations:—‘*annam hutvā*’—*i*. *e*., in the
fire;—‘*mantra &c*.’.—*i.e*., ‘from that sin which would accrue from the
misuse of Mantras and Rites, and from the delinquencies of the
Agent’;—‘*tatphalam*’—the result following from the Homa;—‘*Idam
na*’—the construction is that ‘whatever is offered to the guest with due
respect, in the shape of all this, seat and the rest, is never lost’.
