This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 688), which (on p.
694) explains ‘*Aurabhrikaḥ*’ as ‘one who keeps sheep as a means of
livelihood’,—and *māhiṣikaḥ*’ as meaning either (a) ‘one who keeps
buffaloes’, or (b) ‘the son of an unchaste woman’,—this latter
explanation being based upon a text quoted from Devala,—‘An unchaste
wife is called *Māhiṣī*; the son born of her is called *Māhiṣikaḥ*,’—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 484);—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which
explains ‘*pretaniryātakaḥ*’ as ‘one who carries dead bodies on payment
of wages’.
