This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601), without comment;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 754) as laying down what should be done
after the offering of the Balls has been made;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
177), which explains that the ‘*Lepabhāginaḥ*,’ ‘Partakers of smearings’
are the ancestors, the great-great-grandfather, his father and his
grandfather;—one’s own father, grandfather and great-grandfather being
called ‘*pīṇḍabhāginaḥ*’;—the same explanation is repeated by the same
work on p. 239.

It is evidently a misprint in Buhler’s note where he includes the
‘great-grandfather’ under the ‘*lepabhāginaḥ*’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 507);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1449), which has the following notes:—‘*Nyupya*’, having deposited on
the kuśa-grass,—‘*prayataḥ*’ with proper care,—such care as implies
concentration of mind, freedom from forgetfulness and so forth; in fact
it stands for the entire procedure,—‘*vidhipūrvakam*’ refers to rules
prescribed in ordinances other than those of Manu himself,—‘*teṣu
darbheṣu*’, those kuśa-blades upon which the Balls have been
deposited,—‘*tam*’, that hand by which the Ball has been
offered—‘*lepabhāginaḥ*’ *i.e*., intended for those Pitṛs who are
entitled to the ‘smearings’ *i*. *e*., the four ancestors, above the
great-grandfather;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 190).
