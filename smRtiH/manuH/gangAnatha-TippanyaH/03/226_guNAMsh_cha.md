This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 229), which explains ‘*guṇān*’
as ‘accessories’,—and ‘*bhūmāveva*’ as meaning that the dish containing
the curries should be put on the ground, and the curries should not be
served on the dish out of which the food is eaten; but the curry may be
served on this latter in the absence of a second dish.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 493), which explains ‘*guṇān*’ as
‘vegetable and other accessories,’ which are further specified as
‘*sūpa-śāka*’ and the rest; these should be served in vessels placed on
the ground, and in those placed in another vessel;—in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1372), which adds the following notes—‘*Bhūmau*’, in
vessels placed on the ground,—‘*guṇān*’, things called ‘*guṇa*’,
‘accessory’,—viz., ‘*sūpa-śāka* &c.’; ‘*sūpa*’ is a special preparation
of *Mudga* and other grains cooked with rice, and culled ‘*barānna*’,
and ‘*śāka*’ for cooked roots, fruits, leaves etc.; the particle ‘*ca*’
includes other rich kinds of food, milk-rice, cakes, and so forth;—in
*Śrāddhakaumudī* (p. 158), which explains ‘*guṇān*’ as subsidiary
articles of food,—‘*bhūmau*’ as ‘not on the feeding-dish itself *i*.
*e*., in other dishes placed near the feeding dish;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhali* (Kāla, p. 545).
