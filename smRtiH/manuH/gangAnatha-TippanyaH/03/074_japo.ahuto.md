This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 589) as setting
forth further causes for the degradation of a Brāhmaṇa family;—also in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 676) to the same effect;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 208), which explains that the *selling* of ‘cows’ and
‘horses’ is what is meant here.
