‘*Suvāsinīḥ*’—‘Newly married girls *i.e*., daughters and
daughters-in-law’ (Medhātithi);—‘women whose fathers and fathers-in-law
are living, even though they may have got children’ (‘others,’ quoted by
Medhātithi).

‘*Agre*’—‘Before (the guests)’ (Kullūka);—Medhātithi adopts the reading
‘*anvak*’ and explains it to mean ‘along with (the guests)’; and not as
‘even if they come later,’ as Hopkins interprets him.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 455), which explains
‘*agre*’ as ‘first’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 147).
