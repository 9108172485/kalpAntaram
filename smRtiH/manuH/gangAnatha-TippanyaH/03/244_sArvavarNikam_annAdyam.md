This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 750), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Sārvavarṇikam*’ means ‘that food which contains
the particular vegetable called *Sarvavarṇā*;—and in *Aparārka* (p.
504), which explains that what is meant by ‘*sannīya*’ is that the food
should be collected in one vessel.
