‘*Bandhuḥ*’—‘The brother-in-law, one belonging to the same *gotra*, or
some such remote relation’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘cognate
kinsman’ (Kullūkā and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 558), which explains
‘*vitpati*’ as ‘the son-in-law and ‘*bandhu*’ as ‘blood relations, as
well as those related by friendship’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 447);—in
*Godādharapoddhati* (Kāla, p. 574);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 991).
