‘*Guroḥ*’—‘The *Upādhyāya*’, Sub-teacher (Medhātithi);—‘the *Ācārya*
Teacher (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687), which (on p.
693) adds that the person meant to be excluded by the second half of the
verse is the person who contracts the said alliances with one
*associating with a person who has committed a heinous crime*,—and not
with the latter person himself, as such a relation of the ‘heinous
criminal’ would be an ‘outcaste’ himself, and hence liable to be
excluded as such;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).
