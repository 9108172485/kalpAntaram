Burnell is not right in remarking that ‘this is the most common form
now.’ Among the better classes of the Brāhmaṇas the ‘Brāhma’ still
continues to be the most common form; and among others, the form most
common now is the Āsura.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849), where
‘*dharmataḥ*’ is explained as meaning ‘according to family-custom’; or
‘in obedience to the law governing the Ārṣa marriage, not by way of a
*price* for the girl.’

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 155) as showing that it is not
necessary that the number of ‘cows given should be always ‘two’ as
mentioned in other *Smṛtis*;—it adds that if the Father of the Bride
accept this ‘pair of cow and bull’ it becomes a ‘selling’ of the
girl;—in *Hemādri* (Dana, p. 684);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
62a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228), which explains
‘*Gomithunam*’ as ‘a milch cow and a bull.’
