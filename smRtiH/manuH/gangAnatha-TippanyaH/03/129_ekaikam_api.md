‘*Priyaḥ*’—‘Son-in-law’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘Friend’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Parisaṃvatsarān*’—Kullūka reads ‘*parisaṃvatsarāt*.’

“The Mahābhārata has here *parisaṃvatsaroṣitān*, ‘gone a year on a
journey.’”—(Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 454) as laying down
the ‘Madhuparka’ offering for the King and some others.

*Medhātithi* (Footnote, p. 237.)—The printed editions have wrongly
treated the verse ‘*yadyadiṣṭatamam &c*.’ as Manu’s text. It is only a
part of Medhātithi’s comment, quoted by him as the ‘*Smṛtyantara*’
referred to by him in line 16.
