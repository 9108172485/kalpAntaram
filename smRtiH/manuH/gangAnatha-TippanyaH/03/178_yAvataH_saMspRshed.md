Medhātithi is misrepresented by Buhler, who says that “according to
Medhātithi the object of this verse is to admit virtuous and learned
men, afflicted with bodily defects, as guests at rites in honour of the
gods.” As a matter of fact, this explanation is adduced by Medhātithi as
given by ‘others’; its meaning, given by himself being that ‘just as the
thief and the rest are defilers of company, so equally blameworthy is
the unlearned Brāhmaṇa also’,—exactly as Kullūka explains the verse.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 465);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 41).
