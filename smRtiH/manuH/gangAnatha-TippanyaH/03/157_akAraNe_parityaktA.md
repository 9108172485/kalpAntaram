This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.220, p. 146) in support of the
view that the *sister’s son* and other similar relatives (mentioned in
the next verse, and in Yājñavalkya, 1.220) are to be fed at the
*Śrāddha* only if the above described ‘Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda’ is
not available;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 558), along with the next
verse;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha; p. 447);—in *Godādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
514), which remarks that this secondary method is put forward in view of
the fact that very few Brāhmaṇas are really fit for being fed at
Śrāddha;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 991).

*Medhātithi* (P. 250, l. 15)—‘*Pratinidhinyāyenā*.’—See *Mīmāṃsā sūtra*
3.6.37. The *Yava* having been laid down as a substitute at sacrifices
for the *Vrīhi*, the question is raised as to the necessity or otherwise
of performing all those acts in connection with the substitute which
have been laid down in connection with the original; and the conclusion
is that the substitute has to be treated exactly in the same manner as
the original.
