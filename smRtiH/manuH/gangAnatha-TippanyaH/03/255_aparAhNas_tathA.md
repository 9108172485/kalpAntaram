This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 474), which explains ‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ as
connoting ‘plenty’, and ‘*Mṛṣṭi*’ as connoting ‘deliciousness’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 111 and 72), which adds the following
notes:—‘*V* *āstu*’, the house built for the Śrāddha-performance,—its
‘*Sampādana*’ means ‘building or acquiring by purchase, making it slope
towards the South, levelling, washing and besmearing with
cow-dung’—‘*Sṛṣṭi*’ means ‘giving away’ *i.e*., freely giving away
vegetables and other things,—‘*Mṛṣṭi*’, cleanliness or
sweetness,—‘*agryāḥ*’, those equipped with *Vedic* learning,—these are
‘*Śrāddhasampadaḥ*’ *i.e*., excellences of things used at the Śrāddha;
this implies that all these should be got together.
