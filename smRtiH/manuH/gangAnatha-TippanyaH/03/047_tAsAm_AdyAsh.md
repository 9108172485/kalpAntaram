This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 438);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 559), which adds that the ‘eleventh’ and
other numbers refer to the days of the ‘season;’ the eleventh day of the
‘season’ and so forth;—and in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 368) which, for
the first quarter, reads *tāsāmāpañcataḥ sarvā*, which means ‘all days
till the fifth’, coming to the same thing—that the first four days are
forbidden.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 104); which adds that the
‘eleventh’ and ‘thirteenth’ are meant to be the days of the ‘season’,
not of the *fortnight*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 727), which adds that the
‘eleventh’ and ‘thirteenth’ are the days, not of the fortnight, but of
the ‘period’;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 682), which has the same note,
adding that such is the view of *Madanapārijāta*;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 38), which says that of the sixteen nights, the first four
arc to be avoided;—and in *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 118).
