‘*Tejomūrtiḥ*’—‘Endowed with the body of light,’ qualifying the
‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ (Medhātithi);—Kullūka reads ‘*tejomūrti*’ (neuter) and
explains it as ‘resplendent’, qualifying the ‘place’.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 403), where it is
noted that the use of the word ‘*archati*’, ‘honours’, is meant to imply
that even the making of offerings to crows and others should not be
accompanied by a feeling of disrespect, or contempt.—‘*Patharjunā*’ is
to be construed as ‘*ṛjunā pathā*’.
