*Medhātithi* (p. 189, 1. 14)—‘*Vedaśabdaḥ śākhāvacano
vyākhyātaḥ*’—Hopkins calls this ‘a later view’ and refers to Āpastamba
2. 6.5.

The first quarter of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on p. 24, l.
36), in amplification of Yājñavalkya’s statement that ‘Studentship is to
extend over twelve years’, and the meaning is deduced that twelve years
should be devoted to the study of each Veda.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 131);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 505), where the note is added that—‘If one
intends to perform the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and such other sacrifices, which can
be performed only with the help of the three Vedas, one has to learn all
the three Vedas, the Ṛk, Yajuṣ and Sāman;—if he is going to perform the
*Prākṣaumika* and the *Haviryajñas*, he has to learn only, two, the Ṛk
and the Yajuṣ;—while if he intends to perform only the *Pākayajñas*, he
should learn only his own hereditary rescensional Vedic text; in the
case of the other Vedas also, he should confine himself to only those
rescensions which may have been studied by his forefathers, and not any
one at random.

The verse is also quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 587) in support of the
view that every Brāhmaṇa is entitled to the study of various Vedic
rescensional texts;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 680); in *Saṃskāraratnamālā*
(p. 568);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 49a).
