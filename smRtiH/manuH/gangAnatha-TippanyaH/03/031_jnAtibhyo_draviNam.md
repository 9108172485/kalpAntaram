This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 852), where it
explains ‘*Āpradānam*’ as *ādānam grahaṇamiti yāvat*, *i.e*.,
‘taking’;—and ‘*Svācchandyāt*’ as ‘of his own free will, not in
obedience to the wish of the bride’s father,’ his right over her having
been created by purchase.

*Smṛtitattva* (I, p. 593) quotes the verse and refers to Kullūka Bhaṭṭa
as explaining ‘*āpradānam*’ as ‘taking of the girl’; and it explains
‘*svācchandyāt*’ as ‘by his own will.’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dana, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 229), which explains ‘*āpradānam*’ as ‘*ādānam*’,
‘taking’, and ‘*svācchandyāt*’ as ‘at one’s will’, irrespectively of the
willingness or otherwise of the gill, thus differing from the
‘*Gāndharva*’ in which both are willing.
