Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa raise the question as to the prescribed
offerings and wedding ceremonies being performed in the cage of the
Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca forms of marriage; and on the strength of
a text of Devala’s and another of Śaunaka (*Bahvṛca Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa*)
they declare that the offerings must be made, but that no Vaidika
mantras should be recited; this latter reservation being based on Manu’s
text (8.226). Medhātithi discusses this at great length under verse 34
below, from which it appears that the opinion on this subject has always
been divided. In support of the view that the subsequent rites are
essential, several texts are quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, pp.
861-862).

This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 855), where the
‘*Anyonyasaṃyogaḥ*’ is explained as ‘mutual agreement’,—‘*Maithunyaḥ*,’
‘conducive to all acts accomplished by means of sexual intercourse’,—and
‘*Kāmasambhavaḥ*,’ as ‘originating from excessive lust’;—in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 229), which
explains ‘*Maithunyaḥ*’ as ‘favourable to sexual intercourse.’
