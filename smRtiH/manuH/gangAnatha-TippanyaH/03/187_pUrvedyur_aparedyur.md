“Regarding the diseases which are punishments for sins committed in a
former life, see below, 11.49 *et. seq*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 454), which adds that what is
meant is that ‘if a blind man remains in a place from where a man with
eyes could see the Brāhmaṇas eating,—then he destroys the merit that
would result from the feeding of ninety men’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha,
p. 499).
