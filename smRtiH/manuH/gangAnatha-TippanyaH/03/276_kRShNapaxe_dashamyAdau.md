This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 666) as laying down
what one should do in the event of his being unable to perform the
*Śrāddha* throughout the dark fortnight;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 524),
which remarks that this verse implies also the alternative of beginning
the *Śrāddha* on the *fifth* and going on daily till the *fifteenth*;—in
*Smṛtitattva* (on p. 173, again on p. 252) as forbidding the performance
of *Śrāddha* on the fourteenth,—and again on p. 845 as forbidding the
performance of the *Śrāddha* on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight
of all months;—in *Aparārka* (p. 422), which adds that the alternative
here laid down is that of beginning the performance of the *Śrāddha* on
the tenth day of the fortnight;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 467),
which says that it refers to the *Mahālayā-śrāddha*;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p, 187) in support of the view that only five, *not
ten*, days of the *kṛṣṇapakṣa* are specially commended, these being the
10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 15th days;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
6);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p, 350);—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p.
382);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla p. 461), which adds that the fourteenth day is
not to be excluded entirely, it is to be avoided only for the Śrāddha to
three ‘deities’ with the exception of that offered to those killed with
weapons;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 194).
