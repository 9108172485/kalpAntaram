Hopkin’s remarks—“A significant alteration in the Mahābhārata 13.47.9
makes the last part of this verse read—‘He is nevertheless purified by a
ceremony known in law’.”—One fails to see what is ‘significant’ in this,
when Hindu law bristles with expiatory ceremonies in connection with
much more heinous offences than the marrying of a Śūdra wife.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.265, p. 1326) as meant to
indicate the gravity of the offence, and as laying down the actual
irrevocable loss of Brāhmaṇahood;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495)
as prohibiting the marrying of the Śūdra by the twice-born;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 750);—in *Aparārka* (p. 87);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 361);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 208),
which notes that what this forbids is the marrying and begetting of
child on a Śūdra wife before a Brāhmaṇa wife.
