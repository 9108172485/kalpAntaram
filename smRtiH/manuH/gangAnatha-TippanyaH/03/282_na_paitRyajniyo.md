‘*Kālaśāka*’—Buhler has misread Medhātithi; there is no such expression
in Medhātithi as ‘*Kṛṣṇavāsudeva*’; the word used is *Kṛṣṇe
vāstukabhede*, which means ‘the darker variety of the *vāstuka* herb’.
According to Nandana, it stands for the ‘Black
*neem*’.—*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 706) quoting the verse, explains
it as ‘well known in the northern country’.

‘*Mahāśalka*’—Medhātithi explains this as ‘*śalyakā*’, ‘the porcupine’,
or (according to ‘others’, a *kind of fish*). \[Medhātithi says nothing
as to ‘others’ *reading ‘saśalkhān*’\].—*Parāśaramādhava* explains it as
‘a particular kind of fish’;—‘*loha*’ as ‘the red-coloured goat’—and
‘*munyanna*’ as ‘*Nīvāra* and the like’.

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 541 and 586);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 14), which says that according to the
‘ancients’, ‘*mahāśalka*’ stands for the *Rohita* fish;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 536).
