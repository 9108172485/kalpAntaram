This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 437) in support of
the view that counting from the first day of the menses, sixteen days
constitute the ‘season’, of which the first four days are condemned by
good men.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 539) quotes this verse, and adds that the
addition of the term ‘*svābhāvikaḥ*’, ‘normal,’ indicates that the
period may vary, on account of the presence of certain diseases and
other causes.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 166);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 680), which adds that the specification of
‘night’ implies the prohibition of intercourse during the day;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 38).
