This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 748), which
explains that the addition of the particle ‘*eva*’ is meant to emphasise
that ‘they should not give up eating, even though they may happen to
touch one another.’

The second half of the verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 497);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 170), which says that this verse forbids the
praising of the food even by means of gestures;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 553), which adds the same note.
