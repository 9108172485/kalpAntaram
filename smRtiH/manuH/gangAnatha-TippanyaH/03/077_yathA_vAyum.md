*Medhātithi* (P. 217, l. 27)—‘*Etadevānyatra paṭhitam*’.—The verse is
quoted from Yājñavalkya (1.97), where *Mitākṣarā* explains the phrase
‘*smārtam karma*’ as ‘the Vaiśvadeva and other religious rites
prescribed in the *Smṛtis*’, as also ‘the ordinary worldly acts of
cooking and the like’, while *Aparārka* explains it simply as ‘acts laid
down in the *Smṛtis*’.

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 301);—and in *Śāntimayūkha*
(p. 4).
