This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 241), which explains the word
‘*mantravat*’ (the reading adopted by it, along with Medhātithi, in
place of ‘*mantravit*’), as referring to the *Yajurveda-text*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaro rasāya—namo vaḥ pitaraḥ śoṣāya—namo vaḥ pitaro jīvāya—namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ svadhāyai—namo vaḥ pitaro ghorāya—namo vaḥ pitaro manyave*,’
where, according to Halāyudha, the six
names—‘Rasa—Śoṣa—Jīva—Svadhā—Ghora—and Manyu’—stand respectively for the
six seasons—Spring, Summer, Rains, Autumn, Pre-winter and Mid-winter;
and what is meant is that these should be thought of as ‘Pitṛs’ and then
saluted.—It further adds that as no such ‘salutation to the Seasons’ is
spoken of in Gobhila’s *Gṛhyasūtra*, what Manu says should be taken as
applying to Brāhmaṇas other than those who belong to the Sāmaveda.

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) also quotes this verse, and adds that the
salutation to the Seasons is to be made with the *mantra*—‘*namo vaḥ
pitaraḥ &c*., *&c*.’

*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 328) quotes this verse, and adds that Medhātithi has
explained the phrase ‘*trirāyamya asūn*’ as ‘*triḥ prāṇāyāmam kṛtvā*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 507);—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1451) to
the effect that the sipping of water should be done after the washing of
the hand;—and in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 193), which adds that the
mantra for bowing to the seasons begins with ‘*vasantāya*’ and that for
saluting the Pitṛs, with ‘*amīmadanta*.’
