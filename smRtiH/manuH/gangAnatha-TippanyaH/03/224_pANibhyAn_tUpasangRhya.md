‘*Apasavyam*’—‘In such a manner that they tend towards the South’
(Medhātithi);—‘Passing the sacrificial thread over the right shoulder
under the left arm’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘with the right hand’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, which he rejects).

‘*Āpasavyena hastena*’—‘With the right hand’ (Kullūka). This
explanation, which Buhler wrongly attributes to ‘others’ (in
Medhātithi), is really put forth by Medhātithi in connection with the
former term ‘*Apasavyam*’, and not the second expression ‘*Āpasavyena
hastena*.’ Nor is it right to say that according to Medhātithi this
second expression means ‘out of the Tīrtha of the right hand which is
sacred to the Manes’; because, as a matter of fact, Medhātithi has given
no explanation of this expression at all. Buhler seems to have got an
imperfect copy of Medhātithi; or did he not pay careful attention to
reading it?

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601) without any
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1321) as distinctly laying down
the ‘*Prācīnāvīta*’.
