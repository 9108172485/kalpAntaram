‘*Vṛṣalī*’—‘Woman in general’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nandana and
Rāghavānanda);—‘a Śūdra woman’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 702), where it
apparently takes the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’ as standing for the Śūdra
woman;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1006), which adds the following
notes—‘*vṛṣalī*’ stands here for *woman in general*,—the Brāhmaṇī also
is a ‘*vṛṣalī*’ in the sense that she ‘hankers after the male’
(*vṛṣasyati bhartāram*); hence the meaning is that ‘if after having
accepted the invitation, one enjoys the company of his wife he incurs
sin,’—‘*modate*’ means *enjoying*, hence conversing and embracing also
are to be avoided,—‘*dātuḥ*,’ of the performer of the
Śrāddha,—‘*duṣkṛtam*’ sin,—becomes transferred to the said transgressor,
*i.e*., some disagreeable results accrue to him. If the words were to be
taken in the literal sense then there could be nothing wrong in eases
where the inviter is a pure, sinless man.
