This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 731) in support of
the view that one should not many a girl with defects;—it explains
‘*vācāṭā*’ as ‘garrulous’ and ‘*piṅgalā*’ as ‘with reddish eyes.’

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 149) quotes it and adds that the defects here
described do not deprive the girl, if married, of the character of the
‘lawful wife,’ as visible (physical) defects can mean only physical
disabilties, and cannot affect the nonphysical spiritual or moral
character of anything.

The verse is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 120), where
‘*rogiṇī*’ is explained as ‘suffering from epilepsy and such diseases,’
and ‘*vācāṭām*’ ‘as one who talks much of improper things,’—and not
simply as ‘garrulous’, which is the explanation of the same author in
another place \[Saṃskāra-prakāśa, p. 731, see first note above\];—also
in *Aparārka* (p. 78) to the effect that one should not many a girl who
is not endowed with the proper marks;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 74);—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 510), which explains ‘*kapilām*’, as ‘of the
colour of red lice,’ and ‘*piṅgalā*’ as ‘of the colour of fire:’—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 200), which explains ‘*vācāṭā*’ as
‘garrulous,’ and *piṅgalā*’ as ‘with tawny eyes;’—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 50a).
