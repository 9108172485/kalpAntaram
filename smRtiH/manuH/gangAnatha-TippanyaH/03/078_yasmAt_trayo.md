‘*Upaskaraḥ*’—‘The pot, the kettle and other household implements’
(Medhātithi);—‘a pot, a broom and the rest’ (Kullūka);—‘a broom and the
rest’ (Rāghavānanda);—all these take the word in the collective sense,
including all ‘household implements’;—Nārāyaṇa alone takes it in the
purely singular sense of ‘the broom’ only.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 533) as laying down the
sources of ‘the sin of the slaughter house’;—it adds the following
explanations:—‘*Sūnā*’ means occasions for killing’;—‘*cullī*’ is the
cooking place’;—‘*Peṣaṇī*’ ‘grinding stone’;—‘*upaskaraḥ*’ ‘the broom
and the rest’;—‘*Kaṇḍanī*,’ ‘mortar and pestle’;—by making use of these
the man incurs sin.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 389) quotes the verse and adds the following
explanations:—‘*Sūnā*’ is ‘occasion for the killing of living
beings’;—‘*Upaskaraḥ*’ is ‘the broom, the pot, the stick and the rest’;
‘*bādhyate*’ (which is its reading for ‘*badhyate*’) means ‘is
stricken—*i.e*., by sin accruing from the killing of
animals’;—‘*vāhayan*’ means ‘making use of,’ ‘operating.’
