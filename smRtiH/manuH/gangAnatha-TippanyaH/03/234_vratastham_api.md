‘*Kutapam*’—The commentators are agreed in explaining this as ‘blanket,’
The word also means ‘the hour of the day after half-past eleven, the
best suited for the offering of Śrāddhas.’ This meaning, however, is not
applicable to the present verse.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 475), which explains ‘*kutapa*’
as ‘blanket.’
