‘*Asapiṇḍā ca yā mātuḥ—asagotrā ca yā pituḥ*’—Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda hold the first ‘*ca*’ to mean that the ‘sagotrā’ of the
mother also is excluded; this exclusion is supported by Vaśiṣṭha as
quoted by Medhātithi;—according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, the second ‘*ca*’ connects the ‘*asapiṇḍā*’
with ‘*pituḥ*’ also. But there appears to be no point in this as the
father’s ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ would be already included under the father’s
‘*asagotrā*’. Medhātithi appears to have been conscious of this, as he
adds that the term ‘*sapiṇḍa*’ here stands for ‘relations’ \[see
*Trans*. p. 26, ll. 3-4, which should be as follows, and not as it
appears there—“*In the present phrase* ‘*asagotrā ca pituḥ*’, *the
particle* ‘*ca*’ *excludes the fathers sapiṇḍā also*.”\]

‘*Amaithunī*’—This is the reading adopted by Medhātithi, to whom Buhler
wrongly attributes the reading ‘*maithune*’ (‘for conjugal union’),
which is the reading of Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka, the last
however explaining it to mean ‘(she is recommended) for the Firelaying,
child-begetting and other acts to be performed by the husband and wife
jointly.’—Medhātithi notes a third reading ‘*amaithune*’, and explains
it to mean that ‘the girl is recommended as an associate at religious
functions, and *not for sexual intercourse*, though he does not consider
this satisfactory.—Medhātithi’s reading ‘*amathunī*’ has been explained
by him to mean ‘not born of unlawful intercourse’, and added for the
purpose of excluding the girl horn of *Niyoga*. Though Nandana also
adopts this same reading, he explains it as one ‘who has had no sexual
intercourse.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 81) in support of the view that
the girl to be married should be one who is ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ on both the
paternal and the maternal sides; it adds that ‘*asagotrā*’ alone would
preclude the *father’s* ‘sagotrā’ also (the gotra of the man being the
same as his father’s); the word ‘*pituḥ*’ has therefore been added with
a view to the ‘*putrikāputra*’.—Such a girl is ‘recommended’—for
‘*dārakarma*’—such rites as cannot be performed without a wife and for
‘*maithune*’, *i.e*., such rites as can he done only conjointly by the
pair, *e.g*. the *Pākayajña*, and the like,—‘*asapiṇḍā ca yā mātuḥ*’ is
meant to preclude the marrying of the daughter of the maternal uncle,
she being the man’s ‘mother’s *sapiṇḍā*’.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 468), where the
following explanation is added—‘who is *asapiṇḍā* of the mother, as also
her *asagotrā*—who is *asagotrā* of the father, and also his
*asapiṇḍā*,—is recommended for all acts to be performed by the
couple’.—It raises the question that the separate mention of the
‘mother’ is superfluous; as the wife has no ‘*piṇḍa*’ or ‘*gotra*’ apart
from the husband; so that the ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ and ‘*asagotrā*’ of the
‘mother’ would be the same as those of the ‘father’;—and supplies the
answer that in the case of the *Gāndharva* and some other forms of
marriage, the bride being not given away by her father, she retains her
*gotra* and *piṇḍa*; so that her ‘*sapinda*’ and ‘*asagotra*’ would not
be the same as those of her husband.

In connection with this verse a peculiar point of view has been set
forth by ‘some people’ in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 691):—

> “Three kinds of *sapiṇḍā* have got to be excluded—
>
> 1.  who is one’s own and his father’s *sapiṇḍā*,
> 2.  who is one’s own *sapiṇḍā*, but not the *sapiṇḍā* of his father,
> 3.  who is not one’s own *sapiṇḍā*, but is the father’s *sapiṇḍā*.
>
> To the first category belongs the girl who is one’s own *sapiṇḍā* as
> being the *sapiṇḍā* of his father, who is the married husband of his
> mother;—to the second category belongs the girl who is not the
> *sapiṇḍā* of that ‘father’ who is only the *supporter* (not the
> *progenitor*), and is one’s own and his natural father’s
> (progenitor’s) *sapiṇḍā*,—and who thus is his own *sapiṇḍā*, but *not*
> that of his supporter-‘father’;—and to the third class belongs that
> girl who is the *sapiṇḍā* of the supporter-‘father’, but not one’s own
> *sapiṇḍā*. All this diversity is based upon the fact that in the case
> of the ‘adopted’ son (in whose case the supporter-father and the
> progenitor-father are different), the son’s body (*piṇḍa*) does not
> contain the constituent elements of the body of the father.
>
> For the same reasons there are four kinds of ‘father’ also—
>
> 1.  the progenitor, the husband of the mother;
> 2.  the owner of the ‘field, *i.e*. the mother’s husband, who is not
>     the progenitor;
> 3.  the owner of the ‘seed’, *i. e*. the progenitor, who is not the
>     husband of the mother;
> 4.  and the supporter, *i.e*. the adoptive father.
>
> Of these the ‘progenitor’, husband of the mother, and the ‘seed-owner’
> both transmit the constituents of their body to the child; and on that
> ground the *sāpiṇḍya* ‘consanguinity’; of these two Fathers to the
> *Aurasa* and *Kṣetraja* sons would be direct; while that of the
> ‘field-owner’ (the second kind of ‘father’) would be only indirect,
> through the *field* (*i.e*., the body of his wife); the bodies of the
> husband and wife having been declared to bo *one*.—Now the girls that
> fall within these three kinds of ‘consanguinity would become excluded
> by the test that ‘one should marry a girl younger than himself, who is
> not his *sapiṇḍā*’ (Yājñavalkya 1. 52). But the *Sapiṇḍā* of the
> Supporter (adoptive) father would not be the *Sapiṇḍā* of the adopted
> son, and as such she would not he excluded by the said text. Hence it
> becomes necessary to find out a text excluding the ‘father’s
> *Sapiṇḍā*;’ and such a text is found in Manu 3. 5 (the present verse).
> This text clearly implies that the girl who falls within seven degrees
> of the ‘*Sāpiṇḍya*’ of the *Secondary Father* (not the progenitor) is
> to be avoided; in this sense the term *pituḥ*, being taken in its
> etymological sense of one *who supports*, *pāti iti pitā*, includes
> the *adoptive*, father also.”

This view is not accepted by the author of *Vīramitrodaya* himself, who
takes Manu’s text to mean the exclusion of the girl who is one’s
*Sapiṇḍā* or *Sagotrā* either through his father or through his mother.

*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 106) quotes this verse, explaining *daṛa-karma* as
‘the act of making a wife’ *i.e*., *the, taking of a wife*.

The first half of the verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1. 53, p. 34)
in the sense that the *sagotrā* girl is to be excluded.

*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 690) quotes this verse and adds that the second
‘*ca*’ excludes the father’s ‘*Sapiṇḍā*’ also. Here also we have a
reproduction of the discussion found in *Parāśaramādhava* (see above).

The verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 133), which adds the
following explanatory notes:—The meaning of this is as follows—The girl
who is *not-sapiṇḍā* of the mother,—and also her *not-sagotrā*, which is
implied by the first ‘*ca*’—is recommended, *i.e*., is fit for being
married. The purport of all this is as follows—Twice-born men are
entitled to marry girls belonging to the same caste as themselves, as
also those belonging to lower castes; the marriage with a girl of the
same caste is the principal or primary form of it, while that with a
girl of a different caste is only secondary;—for the married man two
kinds of acts have been enjoined—sacrifices and intercourse; and in the
text the former set of acts is spoken of by the term ‘*dāra-karma*’, and
the latter set by the term ‘*maithuna*’

Having explained the verse, *Madanapārijāta* also raises the question
why the *Sapiṇḍā* and *Sagotrā* of the *Mother* should be mentioned
apart from that of the *Father*, and deals with it in a somewhat
different manner from that in *Parāśaramādhava* or *Vidhānapārijāta*.
Its answer is that the separate mention is meant to meet the following
case—Devadatta has for Ids mother the *adopted* daughter (of his
grandfather), who has been ‘appointed’ by her adoptive ‘father’;—hence
Devadatta does not inherit the *gotra* of his Progenitor-father;—now the
husband of the aforesaid adopted daughter (*i. e*. the progenitor of
Devadatta) has adopted a daughter, who is the *Sapiṇḍā* of her adoptive
father (Devadatta’s Progenitor), but not the *Sapiṇḍā* of
Devadatta;—thus Devadatta might marry the adopted daughter of his
progenitor. This contingency has been prevented by the separate
exclusion of the ‘Mother’s *Sapiṇḍā*; as the girl, though not the
*Sapiṇḍā* of Devadatta or his adoptive Father, would still be the
*Sapiṇḍā* of his mother, whose *piṇḍa* is one with that of her husband,
(the adoptive father of the girl concerned).

Another question raised is why should the mother’s *asapiṇḍā*, who is
included in the mother’s *asagotrā* implied by the *eha* in the text, be
mentioned separately?—The ‘mother’s *Sapiṇḍā*’ has got to be so
mentioned for the purpose of excluding the girl born in the family of
the father of one’s step-mother, who is one’s own ‘*asapiṇḍā*’, as also
the ‘*asagotrā*’ of the mother, but is the ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ of the mother; so
that if the text had excluded only the ‘mother’s *asagotrā*,’ the said
girl would he marriageable; she becomes excluded, however, by the
condition that she should *not* he his *Another’s sapiṇḍā*’.

It goes on to raise a. further question that the phrase ‘*asagotrā ca
pituḥ*’ need not be taken to include the father’s ‘*asapiṇḍā*’ also, as
the latter is already included under the term ‘father’s *asagotrā*’.—The
answer to this is that the separate exclusion of the ‘father’s
*sapiṇḍā*’ is necessary in view of the following case:—Devadatta’s
father, Yajñadatta, is the adopted son of his father, Bhānudatta,—a girl
is born in the family of Yajñadatta’s *progenitor-father*,—this girl
would be *asagotrā* of Devadatta’s ‘father’ (adoptive), and also
‘*asagotrā*’ of his ‘mother’:—thus there would be a likelihood of
Devadatta marrying this girl;—and this becomes precluded by taking the
‘ca’ to mean the ‘*father’s asapiṇḍā*’. If this had not been intended by
Manu, he would have said ‘*one’s own asagotrā*’ (‘*asagotrā ca
yātmanaḥ*’). Thus the upshot of all this is that the girl to be married
should be ‘*asapiṇḍā* and *asagotrā*’ of his Mother, and also
‘*asapiṇḍā* and *asagotrā* of his Father’.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 196);—in
*Gotra-pravara-nibandha-kadamba* (p. 131), which adds the following
notes:—In as much as the text forbids only the ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ of the
mother, it follows that the *sagotrā* of the mother is not forbidden;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 184), which adds the following
explanation:—The girl who is not ‘*sapiṇḍā*’ either of the bridegroom or
of his mother, and who is not the ‘*sagotrā*’ of the bridegroom or his
father, is commended for the purpose of marriage;—in *OodādharUpaddhati*
(Kālasāra, p. 223), which adds the following notes—‘*Dārakarmaṇi*’, in
the rite that makes a ‘wife’,—‘*maithune*’, in the act of intercourse
*which is consummated conjointly by man and woman*;—the sense is that
the said girl is commended not only for cooking and such other acts as
are done by the woman alone, but also in that joint act which is done by
both conjointly; according to *Kalpataru*, ‘*maithune*’ means ‘in the
begetting of the lawful son by means of sexual intercourse’.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 477), in support of
the view that not only the girl, but her family also should be carefully
examined;—also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 588);—in *Aparārka* (p.
84);—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 508);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 204).
