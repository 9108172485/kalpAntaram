This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 138), where it is
explained as meaning that in the case of Brāhmaṇas, that marriage is
considered most commendable in which water is the only substance used as
the instrument; while in that of the Kṣatriya and others, it may bo
accomplished, even without the pouring of water, simply by mutual
consent, the father of the bride agreeing to give, and the bridegroom to
receive, the girl. This does not mean, however, that in the latter case
water should never be used.
