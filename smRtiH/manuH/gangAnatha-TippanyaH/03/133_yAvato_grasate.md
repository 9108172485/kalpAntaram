According to Nārāyaṇa the punishment here mentioned falls on the
*eater*.—Medhātithi mentions both explanations.

For ‘*guḍān*’ Nandana reads ‘*hulān*’ and explains it as ‘double-edged
sword.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 449), which explains ‘*śūlam*’
and ‘*ṛṣti*’ as particular weapons,—and ‘*ayoguḍa*’ as ‘an
iron-ball’;—and *in Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 401).
