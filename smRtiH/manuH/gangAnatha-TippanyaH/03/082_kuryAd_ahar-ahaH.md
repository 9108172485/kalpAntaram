‘*Bhṛtya*’ stands for ‘aged parents and others’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja
and Kullūka),—or ‘born slaves and others too old to work for them
living,’ also aged cattle &c., which is the alternative explanation,
suggested by Medhātithi, and not only ‘animals unfit for work,’ as noted
by Buhler. Nārāyaṇa, and Nandana read ‘*bhūtānām*’ and explain it as
‘goblins or living beings.’

This verse is quoted in *Viramītrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 392), which reads
‘*bhūtānām*’ for ‘*pāñcānām*’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 146), in support of
the view that there is nothing wrong in doing the cooking for one’s own
self along with the gods and *Pitṛs*; it is only when one cooks for
himself alone that it is wrong.
