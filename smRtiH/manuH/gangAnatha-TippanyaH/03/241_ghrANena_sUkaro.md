‘*Brahmodyāḥ kathāḥ*’—Buhler does not represent Medhātithi quite
rightly: The explanation that he attributes to him, ‘riddles from the
Veda’, is not found in Medhātithi at all. Medhātithi’s *first*
explanation is—‘stories related in the Veda’;—the *second* alternative
proposed is ‘such Vedic texts as the one contained in 23.9 of the
Vājasaneya Saṃhitā’;—and the third explanation, ‘discourses, inordinary
language, on the meaning of Mantras bearing upon Brāhmaṇ’, is offered as
that of the reading ‘*Brahmodyāḥ kathāḥ*’. It will thus be seen that
‘riddles from the Veda’ are not found in Medhātithi at all. It is the
third explanation apparently that has misled Buhler. Hopkins has quoted
Medhātithi correctly.

This verse is quoted in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 546);—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 158);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1027),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Brahmodyāḥ*’, stories that are related
by the Brāhmaṇa, such as accounts of the war between the Gods and the
Asuras, of the killing of Vṛttra, of Saramā and so forth,—or it may
refer to such texts as ‘*Kaścidekāki charati* etc.’; ‘*Brahmādyāḥ*’ is
another reading, which means—‘Those mantras and Arthavāda texts which
deal with Brahman’; ‘*Kathāḥ*’, conversations in the ordinary language
should be carried on, in connection with the said subjects;—‘*this is
liked by the Pitṛs*’—this is *Arthavāda*.
