‘*Gaṇānām-yājakaḥ*’—‘One who sacrifices to the gods; *i.e*., he who
performs the well known *Gaṇayāgas*,’ (Medhātithi);—‘one who sacrifices
for a group of men or friends’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 688) without
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 482).
