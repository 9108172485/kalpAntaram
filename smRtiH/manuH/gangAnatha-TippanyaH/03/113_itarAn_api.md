This verse is quoted without comment in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
394);—and in *Aparārka* (p. 154) as laying down the treatment to be
accorded to such relations and friends as happen to arrive after the
Householder himself has eaten,—and as implying that the wife should eat
*after* the husband has eaten.
