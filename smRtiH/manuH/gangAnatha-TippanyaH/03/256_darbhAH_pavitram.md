This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.239) in support of the view
that ‘the food served to the Brāhmaṇas should be served in sufficiently
large quantities, to make it possible for there being *leavings*, which
constitute the share of the servants and others;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Āhnika, p. 376), without any comment;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 325);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 504), which adds that what has been left fallen on the
ground by the Brāhmaṇas should be offered for such honest and hard
working slaves as may have died;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 151 and
1511), which adds that *dāsavarga* here stands for the father’s
principal servant who may be dead;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
562).
