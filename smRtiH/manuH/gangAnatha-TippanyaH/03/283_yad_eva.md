“The day meant is *Bhādrapada*, *Badi*, 13”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 117) without comment;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 555), which adds that the Accusative ending in
‘*trayodaśīm*’ has the force of the Locative;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
201);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 272), which explains the meaning as
‘whatever mixed with Honey is offered on the thirteenth of the month,
under the asterism of *Maghā* becomes inexhaustible’;—in
*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 385);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 356);—and in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 470 and Śrāddha, p. 87).
