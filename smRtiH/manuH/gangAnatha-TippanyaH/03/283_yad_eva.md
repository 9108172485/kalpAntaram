This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 391) in support of
the view that in case one is unable to perform all the three rites of
*Tarpaṇa, Śrāddha* and *Bali*, if he performs even one of them, he is
saved from the sin of neglecting the ‘offerings to the Pitṛs’;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 946).
