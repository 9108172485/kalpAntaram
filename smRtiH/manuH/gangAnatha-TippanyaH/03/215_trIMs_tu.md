This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 601), without any
comment;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1427), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tasmāt haviḥśeṣāt*’, out of the remnant of the substance
offered into the Fire,—‘*audakavidhi*’ stands for the method by which an
offering of water is made with hands in the *Apasavya* form, as laid
down in the preceding verse.
