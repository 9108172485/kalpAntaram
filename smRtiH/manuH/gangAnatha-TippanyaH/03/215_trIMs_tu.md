This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 456) as meaning that the Brāhmaṇa
to be fed in honour of the Viśvedevas should be invited before that to
be fed in honour of the Pitṛs; and concludes that the matter is purely
optional, in view of the contrary rule laid down by Pracetas;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī*, (p. 54);—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 526),
which explains ‘*daivādyantam*’ as ‘beginning and ending with the
offering to the Devas’, which means that the invitation is to be made
afresh in connection with the *Devakṛtya*, and the concluding rites
should be performed last of all for the Devas;—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1045), which says that the other rites shall begin with the
Devas, but the *Visarjana* is to be done last for the Devas.
