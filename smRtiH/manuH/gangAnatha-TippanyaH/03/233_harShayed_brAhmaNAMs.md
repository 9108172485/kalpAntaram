This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1026), which has the
following notes:—‘*Tūṣṭaḥ*,’—even though he may have real cause for
grief, he should not show it by sighs or other expressions, he should
show himself happy; ‘*Brāhmaṇān harṣayet*’ with singing and other things
done by others,—or by himself, in due conformance with propriety, or
with jokes suggested by the occasion; the meaning is that if the invited
appear to become bored by the long-continued recitation of Vedic hymns
*&c*., he should amuse them by means of stories of heroic deeds or songs
and the like;—‘*Shanairbhojayet*,’ should feed them with such gentle
persuasive expressions as ‘this is very tasty, do please take a few
morsels’ and so forth;—‘*annādyena*’ milk-rice and such
foods,—‘*guṇaiḥ*’, vegetables,—‘*asakṛt*,’ again and again;
‘*parichodayet*,’ should urge, with such words as ‘these cakes are very
nice, this preparation of milk is very tasty’, ‘taking each thing in his
hand, he should stand before the invited, and repeat the persuasion
again and again,—this is what is meant by ‘urging.’
