‘*Vṛṣalī*’—Neither Medhātithi nor Kullūka takes this in the sense of a
‘Śūdra female.’ Buhler is not right in attributing this explanation to
them. Both of them explain it as ‘any woman’; and they derive this
meaning etymologically, by using the term ‘*vṛṣasyati*,’ ‘one who
attracts to herself the male.’ Nor is Buhler right in attributing to
Nārāyaṇa the explanation that the word ‘*vṛṣalī*’ means ‘a seducing
woman’; as Nārāyaṇa also uses the term ‘*vṛṣasyanti*’ only by way of
pointing out the etymological signification of the term ‘*vṛṣalī*’.
