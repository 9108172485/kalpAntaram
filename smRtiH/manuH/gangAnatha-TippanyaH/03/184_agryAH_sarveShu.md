This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.222) as providing the
definition of the ‘*Kuṇḍa*’ and the ‘*Golaka*’, who have been declared
by Yājñavalkya, (1.222) to be unfit to be invited at *Śrāddhas*;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 445), which adds that this refers to the *Kṣetraja* son,
the other being excluded on the ground of his being a non-Brāhmaṇa;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 362);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 39);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 422.)
