This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 354) as laying down
certain distinctions to he borne in mind in entertaining guests;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 450), which adds that as regards food and
other things, it must he the same for all, specially when they are all
dining together in the same line; as specially laid down by Hārīta;—and
in *Aparārka* (p. 156), which adds that the ‘following’ is to be done
when the guest departs.
