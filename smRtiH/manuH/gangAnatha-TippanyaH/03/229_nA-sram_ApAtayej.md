‘*Avadhūnayet*’—‘Shake; *i.e*., throw it by the hand and then take it
in’ (Medhātithi);—‘Shake a piece of cloth over the food, as is often
done for the removing of dust etc.’ (‘Others’ mentioned in Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1029), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘there should be no weeping’, and goes on to add—what
is forbidden is not the tear of joy (at the offering), but the tears
that may come to the eyes by reason of the death of the beloved
relative,—the telling of lies which has already been prohibited
elsewhere from moral considerations, is here forbidden as affecting the
performance of the offering;—one should not touch with his feet any kind
of food, whether, clean or unclean,—nor should cloth be shaken over the
food;—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 161), which explains ‘*asram*’ as
tears of grief, and in regard to the ‘shaking of cloth’, it says that
some people explain it as *dusting the doth over the food*, while
according to others, what is forbidden is the fanning of the food with a
piece of cloth;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 549).
