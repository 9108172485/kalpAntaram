+++
This verse is quoted in ‘*Vīramitrodaya*’ (Saṃskāra, p. 856), where the
following explanation is given—‘*Hatvā*’—‘having beaten, those
obstructing him’;—‘*Chittvā*’—having cut off, the heads of the
obstructors’;—‘*Bhittvā*’—‘having pierced, with strokes of
weapons’;—‘*Krośantīm*’—calling for her relations;—all this indicates
fighting.

The second half is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 129) in support of
the view that what distinguishes the *Rākṣasa* form is *forcible
abduction*.

The verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 685);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra,:p. 229), which explains ‘*prosahya*’ as ‘by force’.
