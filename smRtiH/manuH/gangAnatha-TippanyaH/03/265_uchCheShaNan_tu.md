This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 331);—in *Gadādharapaddhati*
(Kāla, p. 490), which explains ‘*Gṛhabali*’ as standing for *Bhūtayajña*
and implying the entire Vaiśvadeva offering,—as held in *Kalpataru*;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 958), which notes that according to Medhātithi
and Karka the term ‘*bali*’ here stands for the Vaiśvadeva offering; but
for the Kākabali, according to Divodāsa;—in *Hemādri* (*Kāla*, p. 606),
which reproduces the entire commentary of Medhātithi—in

*Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 426), which also quotes Medhātithi to the
effect that ‘*bali*’ stands for the *Vaiśvadeva* offering;—and in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1062), where also Medhātithi’s commentary is
reproduced *in toto*.
