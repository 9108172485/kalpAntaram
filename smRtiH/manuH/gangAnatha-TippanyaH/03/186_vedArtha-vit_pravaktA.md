This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 557), which explains
‘*pravaktā*’ as ‘the expounder of the meaning of the Veda’;—and
‘*Sahasradaḥ*’ as ‘one who gives a thousand *cows*’ (quoting Medhātithi
as the propounder of this explanation),—and ‘*śatāyuḥ*’ as ‘one who has
completed a full hundred years’.

‘*Brahmacāri*’ is explained by Nandana as ‘the chaste man’.
