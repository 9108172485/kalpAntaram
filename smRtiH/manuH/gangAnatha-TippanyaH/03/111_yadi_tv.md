‘*Kāmam*’—May; *i.e*., ‘it is not incumbent upon him; it is left to his
choice’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘as much as the person wishes’
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 354) as laying
down what should be done if a *Kṣatriya* comes to one’s house as a
guest;—in *Aparārka* (p. 152) as laying down that the Householder may,
if he likes, entertain guests other than the Brāhmaṇas;—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 440), which notes that this lays down the rule that to the
*Śūdra* thus arrived one should offer the food left in the dishes.
