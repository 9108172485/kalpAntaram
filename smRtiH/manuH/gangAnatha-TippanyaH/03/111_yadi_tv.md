Compare Hitopadeśa, 1.33.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.107, p. 78), which explains it
to mean that if there is no food to be given, the guest may be duly
honoured even with ‘grasses, place, water and speech’;—also in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 441), where ‘*Sūnṛtā*’ is explained as
‘agreeable and true’.
