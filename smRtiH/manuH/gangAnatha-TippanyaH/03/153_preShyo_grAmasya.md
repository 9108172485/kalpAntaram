It is interesting to note that this verse is omitted in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 687) and *Madanapārijāta* (p. 560), though
both quote the preceding and the following verses. But the former
includes it in the explanations given later on (on p. 690), where the
term ‘*tyaktāgnim*’ is explained as ‘one who abandons the Śrauta and
Smārta fires without any reason for giving up the compulsory
duties,’—‘*vārdhuṣin*’ is explained as ‘one who borrows money at a cheap
rate and lends it at a higher rate of interest’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 481);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Śrāddha p. 9a);—and in *Śrāddha-kriyākaumudī* (p. 40), which explains
‘*guroḥ pratiroddhā*’ as ‘one who behaves disagreeably to the Teacher,’
and ‘*vārdhuṣī*’ as ‘one who lives by lending money on interest’
