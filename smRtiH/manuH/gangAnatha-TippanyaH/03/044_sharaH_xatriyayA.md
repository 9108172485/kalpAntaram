title = "044 शरः क्षत्रियया"

+++
This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 835), which adds
that what is meant by the phrase ‘*Kṣatriyayā grāhyaḥ*’ is that ‘the
Kṣatriya girl should catch hold of the arrow already held by the
bridegroom,’ and so on with the rest also.

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 496);—and in
*Smṛtitattva* (II, page 107).
