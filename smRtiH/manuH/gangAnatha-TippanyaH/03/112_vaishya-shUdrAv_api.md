The first half of this verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
351) in support of the view that a guest is to be treated as such only
on the day on which he arrives, not if he stays till the next day.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 438) as explaining
what is meant by the term ‘*atithi*’ (guest);—in *Aparārka* (p. 155);—in
*Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 676 and Śrāddha, p. 427).
