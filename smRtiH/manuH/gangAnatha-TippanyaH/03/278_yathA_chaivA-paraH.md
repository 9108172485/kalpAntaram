*Medhātithi* (P. 297, l. 16)—‘*Vacanāni tvapūrvatvāt*.’—This is Mīmāṃsā
sūtra 3.5.21. The question arising as to whether or not there should be
an ‘eating of remnants’ in the case of the *Soma juice*,—the conclusion
is that there should be the eating of it; and this conclusion is based
upon a passage referring to a totally different subject; which shows
that even an unknown fact can serve as an illustration in support of a
definite conclusion.

This verse is quoted in *Kālaviveka* (p. 366), which explains that the
precise meaning of the verse is that ‘from the three parts into which
the day is divided, forenoon, mid-day and afternoon, the afternoon is
superior to the other two.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 465), which adds that the term
‘*aparāhṇa*’ stands here, not for the fourth part of the day divided
into five parts, but simply for ‘the latter half of the day,’ which is
its etymological meaning;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 373);—in
*Śrāddhakriyakaumudī* (p. 314);—in *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 236);—in
*Śrāddhakaumudī* (p. 248); and in *Kālamādhava* (p. 109).
