This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 557), which supplies the
following explanations:—‘*Triṇāciketaḥ*’—‘one who studies that portion
of the Yajurveda which is

called the *Triṇāciketas*, and who keeps the observances connected
therewith’;—‘*Pañcāgniḥ*’—‘one who maintains the five Fires—(1)
*Gārhopatya*, (2) *Dakṣiṇāgni*, (3) *Āhavanīya*, (4) *Sabhya* and (5)
*Āvasatha*’;—‘*Trisuparṇa*’—is the name of a portion of the Yajurveda
(Medhātithi says it is a *mantra* found in the *Taittirīya* and the
*Ṛgveda*); and he who knows that text and its meaning is also called by
the same name;—‘*ṣaḍaṅgavit*’—‘one who knows the texts.and meanings of
the six subsidiary sciences, *Śikṣā, Kalpa* and the
rest’;—‘*Brāhmadeyānusantānaḥ*’—‘one who is born of a mother married in
the Brāhma form’;—‘*Jyeṣṭhasāmagaḥ*’—‘one who is constantly singing Sāma
hymns,’ or ‘he who keeps the observance known as *Jyeṣṭha-sāma*, and
knows the Sāma texts known under that name’.

‘*Triṇāciketaḥ*’—see Āpastamba, 2.17.22.

‘*Pañcāgniḥ*’—‘Knowing the Pañcāgnividyā, taught in the Chāndogya
Upaniṣad 4.10 *et. seq*.’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘who keeps the five
Fires’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

‘*Trisuparṇa*’.—‘One who knows the text of Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 10.38-40’
(Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘one who knows Ṛgveda 10.114.3-5’
