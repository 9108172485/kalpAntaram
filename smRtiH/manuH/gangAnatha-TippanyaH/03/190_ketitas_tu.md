What is meant is that ‘the man will be born as an animal feeding upon
the things specified’ (according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—that ‘the food will be rejected by the Pitṛs and Gods, as
impure’ (according to Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Apratiṣṭham*’—‘Has no place’ (Medātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghvānanda);—‘secures no fame to the giver’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 454).
