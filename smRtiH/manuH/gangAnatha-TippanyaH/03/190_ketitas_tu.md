‘*Atikrāman*’—‘Does not present himself at the time of eating, and does
not maintain continence’ (Medhātithi, who is slightly misrepresented by
Buhler, who attributes to him only the latter part of the
explanation);—‘breaks the appointment’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa
and Rāghavānanda);—‘who does not accept the invitation’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi, who rejects this explanation).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 701) in support of
the view that the man ‘who having accepted the invitation, subsequently
refuses it, even though quite fit to respond to it, incurs a sin.’ It
explains ‘*ketitaḥ*’ as ‘being invited.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 565) quotes the verse;—also *Aparārka*, (p. 457),
which adds that this refers to the person who has accepted the
invitation;—and *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1002), which adds the following
notes;—‘*Ketitaḥ*,’ invited;—the meaning is that if, on an invitation,
the invited fails to keep the restrictions, he becomes a
pig;—‘*Kathañcit*,’ intentionally or through forgetfulness; others hold
that ‘*atikrāman*’ means ‘not accepting the invitation,’ but this view
has been criticised and rejected by Medhātithi.
