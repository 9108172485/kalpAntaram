This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1353), which adds the
following notes:—The meaning is that ‘after having made offerings to (1)
Agni, (2) Soma and (3) Yama, one should satisfy the Fathers who are
present in the person of the invited Brāhmaṇas’;—according to the
explanation given by Medhātithi and Harihara, we have only two deities
here—(1) Agni and (2) the joint deity Soma-Yama; and the genitive ending
in ‘*agneḥ*’ has the sense of the Dative, and this conjoint deity is to
be accepted only by those in whose *Gṛhya* such a joint deity is
mentioned. Our view is that the two, Soma and Yama, are to be treated
separately, not jointly, as is clear from the reading
‘*agnisomayamānāñca*’ adopted by some *Nibandhas*.
