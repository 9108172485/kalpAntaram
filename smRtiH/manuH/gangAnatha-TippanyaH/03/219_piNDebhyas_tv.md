‘*Vidhivat*’—‘Giving to the Brāhmaṇa invited in honour of the Father a
piece out of the Ball offered to the Father, and so forth’
(Kullūka);—‘after they have sipped water, and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa).

“Nandana inserts here verse 223 and states that it is explanatory of the
term ‘according to rule.’”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 326);—and in *Hemādri*
(Śrāddha, p. 1476).
