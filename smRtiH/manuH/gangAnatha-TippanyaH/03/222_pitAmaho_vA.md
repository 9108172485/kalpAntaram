The first half of this verse is quoted without comment in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 542);—also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 362);—and in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 554), which notes that ‘*Śrāddham*’ stands for
the ‘Śrāddha-oflferings,’ the things offered; as the ‘*Śrāddha*’ itself
cannot be eaten, the meaning is that the living grandfather should be
fed on the substances offered at the Śrāddhas, and then the offerings
made to the dead Father and Great-grandfather.
