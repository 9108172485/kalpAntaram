*Medhātithi* (p. 190, 1. 21)—‘*Sāntānikatayā*’—Apte explains
‘*sāntānika*’ as ‘a Brāhmaṇa who wishes to marry for the sake of issue.’
This is not quite correct. The word occurs in Manu 11. 1, where Kullūka
explains it as ‘*vivāhārthi*,’ which has apparently misled the
lexicographer. The word really means ‘he who is desirous of *santāna*,
propagation of his race’, and is applied to the Father who, if poor, has
to beg for the purpose of marrying *his son*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 76), which adds the following
explanation: When the Accomplished Student has been understood
(*pratīta*) as inclined to take a wife;—he being
‘*brahmadāyahara*’—*i.e*., equipped with study of the Veda, and
inherited property, *i.e*., being quite able to maintain a family;—if
the father be devoid of property, he should acquire enough by means of
begging, and then marry; and thus obtain the ‘domestic fire,’ without
which he could not perform the *Pākayajñas*.—‘*Sragvin*’ indicates the
presence of ornaments;—‘*talpa*’ is *bedstead*; when the young man is
seated upon it his father ‘should worship him first with the
*cow*’—*i.e*., with the *Madhuparka*.
