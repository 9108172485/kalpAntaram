This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 542), which explains
‘*pūrveṣām*’ as ‘the three beginning with the grandfather’. Hopkins is
not right when he says that “in this case he offers of course only two
Balls.”

The first half is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 361), in support of the
view that the Ball should be offered to the Father’s father, grandfather
and great-grandfather.

The verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 553), which has the
following notes;—‘*Pūrveṣām*,’ the *father’s* forefathers; another
alternative is that the living Father should be respectfully fed and
then Śrāddha offered to the next two ancestors, *i.e*., the grandfather
and the greatgrandfather.
