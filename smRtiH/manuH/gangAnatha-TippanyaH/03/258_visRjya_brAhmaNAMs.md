Burnell is wrong in saying that ‘verse 248 is apparently omitted by
Medhātithi’ It is strange that scholars of the ‘Critical School’ should
be making such statements on the strength of Mss. which they know to be
imperfect and incomplete.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 802) as likely to be
interpreted as indicating the ‘offering of the Ball’ to be the principal
factor. It combats this view and adds that in the compound
‘*piṇḍanirvapaṇam*’ the term ‘*piṇḍa*’ is to be understood as synonymous
with ‘*pitṛ*’, so that what the compound means is ‘offering to the
Pitṛs.’

*Medhātithi* (P. 286, l. 14)—‘*Sapiṇḍīkaraṇaśrāddham* *&c*.’ This
appears to be a paraphrase of the verse, which is quoted also in
*Mitākṣarā* (on ll. 253-254), where, however, the reading is ‘*pretānna
nirdishet*.’ See below Bhāṣya, p. 289, ll. 15-20.
