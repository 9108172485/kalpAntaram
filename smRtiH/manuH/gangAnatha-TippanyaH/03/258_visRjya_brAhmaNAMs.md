The second half of this verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 183), which
adds the following notes:—Vācaspati Miśra has explained this to mean
that ‘though actually facing the East, the man should, *in thought* face
the South’; but this is not right; as Gobhila has distinctly laid down
that the man should be actually facing the South.—Nor is there any
reason for taking the words of Manu in that sense; it is for this reason
that the commentators have explained the phrase ‘*dakṣiṇām
diśamākāṅkṣan*’ as ‘looking towards the South’.

The verse is quoted in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 207), which has the
following notes:—‘facing the East but looking sideways towards the
South’; Kullūka has explained ‘*ākāṅkṣan*’ as *looking towards*; but
such is not the meaning of the word;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1483), which explains the meaning as—‘Dismissing them, to go their way,
rising and following them and bringing them to the place for washing the
feet, and then looking towards the South, should ask for the desired
boons.’
