‘*Prākchāye kuñjarasya*’—‘In the afternoon, when the shadow cast by the
elephant falls towards the East’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘daring an eclipse’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi, who rejects
it).—*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.218) quotes a definition by which the name
applies to a particular day—

> yadenduḥ pitṛdaivatye haṃsaścaiva kare sthitaḥ \|  
> yāmyāṃ tithirbhavetsāhi gajacchāyā prakīrtitā \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 109), which quotes from
*Vāyupurāṇa* a definition of ‘*Gajacchāyā*’ as the 13th day of the month
during which the sun lies in the asterism of Hastā, and the moon in that
of Maghā;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 245);—in *Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p.
271), which explains ‘*dadyāt*’ as ‘*dadāti*’ and ‘*prākchāye etc*.’ as
‘when the shadow of the elephant is cast towards the East,’ and notes
that this is mere *Arthavāda*;—and in *Vaṛṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 355).
