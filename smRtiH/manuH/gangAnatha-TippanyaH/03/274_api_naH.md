There is nothing in Medhātithi to show that he reads ‘*pūjayet*’ for
‘*bhojayet*’, as stated by Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 512), which explains ‘*Jñāti*’ as
‘relations on the father’s side’, and ‘*bāndhava*’ as ‘relations on the
mother’s side’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1515), which has the
following notes:—‘*Jñāti*’ are relations on the father’s side, *i.e*.,
Sapiṇḍas;—the remnant of the food cooked for the *Śrāddha* should be
made to reach those; *i.e*., they should be fed with it with due
respect; after which one should honour the ‘*Bāndhavas*,’ *i.e*.,
relations on the mother’s and the wife’s side; if, however, on being
asked ‘what shall be done with the remnant?’—the Brāhmaṇas should say
‘give it to us’—then other food should be cooked for the relations; and
these are to be fed with the remnant, only if so permitted by the
Brāhmaṇas. It may be regarded as incumbent on the Brāhmaṇas to give this
permission.
