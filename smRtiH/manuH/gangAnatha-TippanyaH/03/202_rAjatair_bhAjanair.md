This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 61 and 1005), which adds
the following notes ‘*Akrodhanāḥ*,’ free from anger,—‘*śaucaparāḥ*’ is
qualified by ‘*satatam*’, ‘always pure,’—hence the invited should sip
water immediatly on sneezing or spitting,—‘*brahmacāriṇaḥ*,’ avoiding
intercourse with women,—‘*nyastaśastrāḥ*’, who have renounced
cruelty,—‘*mahābhāgāḥ*’, endowed with mercy, generosity and other such
qualities; ‘since Fathers are such the invited who take their form,
should also be so.’
