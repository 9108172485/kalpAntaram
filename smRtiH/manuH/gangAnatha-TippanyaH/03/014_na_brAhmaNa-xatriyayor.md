This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 495) as
countenancing the view that it is better by far that the Brāhmaṇa and
the Kṣatriya should avoid a Śūdra wife altogether, even though he he
overpowered by lust;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 144), where the prohibition
herein contained is explained as referring to the *first*, marriage;—and
‘*āpat*’ is explained as ‘the contingency of not finding a girl of the
same caste’;—and it adds, on the strength of the next verse, that what
is here said is applicable to the Vaiśya also.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 749) quotes the verse and explains
‘*vṛttante*’ as ‘in a story.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 87), which adds that though the verse
mentions only the ‘Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya’ it does not mean that it
is permissible for the Vaiśya; all thaí is meant is that for the two
higher castes it is specially reprehensible;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 205), which says that this prohibition is meant for the
*first* marriage, as is clear from the foregoing verses.
