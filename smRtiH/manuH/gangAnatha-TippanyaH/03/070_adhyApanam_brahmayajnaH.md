‘*Adhyāpanam*’—Nandana reads ‘*adhyāyanam*’ and explains that it is the
same as ‘*adhayanam*.’

Burnell declares that what makes India ‘the land of vermin’ is this
habit of the Hindus of offering food to all living beings!—To what
lengths will the detractor of a religion not go!

This is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 392);—in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
533);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 305), which adds that ‘*adhyāpana*’ stands
for ‘*adhyayana*’ ‘study,’ and ‘*tarpaṇa*’ for ‘*Śrāddha*’;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* ‘(II p. 306), which adds (like Medhātithi) that
‘*adhyāpana*’ includes ‘study’ also; and ‘*tarpaṇa*’ stands for the
daily *Śrāddha* offering;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 918), which
adds that this is only an enumeration of the rites and not an injunction
of the order in which they are to be performed,—some people hold that
the four ‘sacrifices’ here mentioned go under the name of
‘*Vaiśvadeva*,’ but according to *Mādhava*, that name applies to only
three—the Devayajña, the Pitṛyajña and the Bhūtayajña.
