‘*Cokṣesu*’—‘ Naturally clean’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa);—and ‘pleasing’ (Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 471), which explains ‘*cokṣa*’ as
a ‘place that is naturally clean’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 160);—and
in *Śrāddhakriyākaumndī* (p. 102).
