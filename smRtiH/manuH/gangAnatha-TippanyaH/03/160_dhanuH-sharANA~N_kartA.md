This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 687) among others,
enumerating persons who should not be invited at *Śrāddhas*; it adds (on
688) the notes that—the ‘thief’ meant here is one who steals the
belongings of others than the Brāhmaṇas, the stealer of the latter’s
goods being included under ‘outcastes’,——‘*nāstikavṛtti*’ is one who
derives his livelihood from one who denies that there are any rewards
for acts in the other world;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 447), which explains
the ‘*nāstika*’ as ‘one who holds the opinion that there is nothing that
is *divine*,’ and the ‘*nāstikavṛtti*’ as ‘he who makes a living by
expounding and writing on the works of such unbelievers.’

It is quoted also in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 480);—and in
‘*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Śrāddha, p. 9a).
