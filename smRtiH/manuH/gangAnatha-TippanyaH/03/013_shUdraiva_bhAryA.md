Hopkins compares this with the Mahābhārata 13, 47. 8.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404) as an
amplification of what has been declared in the latter half of the
preceding verse;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 740) along with the
preceding verse; and in *Aparārka*, (p. 88), which adds that what is
stated hero is permissible only in the case of people moved by lust, and
not of those who are subject to righteousness; so that these are to be
regarded as ‘inferior—‘*Kramaśaḥ*’ (verse 12) in due order, not in any
topsy-turvy ‘order—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 3), which observes that the
*eva* in ‘*śūdraiva*’ is meant to preclude marriage of the ‘inverse’
order;—*i.e*., where the bridegroom’s caste is lower than that of the
bride;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 206), which adds that this
pertains to marriage for pleasure’s sake.
