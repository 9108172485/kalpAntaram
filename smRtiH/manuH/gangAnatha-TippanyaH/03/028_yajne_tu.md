Hopkins is not quite right when he says that ‘the priest receives the
maiden as part of the fee.’ It is not so, as has been made clear by
Medhātithi. Further the ‘fee’ is always given *after the completion* of
the rite, and not only when ‘*it has begun*’, or while the priest is
still ‘*doing his work*.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849), where the
explanation is added—*Samyak sauṣṭhavena karma kurvate ṛtvije
ityanvayaḥ*; the construction is that the girl is given ‘to the priest
who is doing the work efficiently, in a proper manner’;—in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 684);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 228.).
