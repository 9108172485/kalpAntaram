“Govindarāja is of the opinion that the persons named above (4.22) are
here intended. But from what follows (verses 94, 95) it appears that
those Brāhmaṇas are meant who, though solely intent on the acquisition
of Supreme Knowledge, and retired from all worldly affairs, continue to
reside in their houses; see also 4.257. Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa assume
that they remain Householders, while Kullūka counts them among the
ascetics.”—*Buhler*.
