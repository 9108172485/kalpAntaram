Buhler is not right in asserting that “according to Medhātithi the word
‘*brāhmaṇā*’ is not intended to exclude other Aryans (*dvijas*)”.—He has
evidently been misled by the words in which Medhātithi has set forth an
objection to the text using the word ‘Brāhmaṇa’. See *Translation*.

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57) in
support of the view that the *Brāhmaṇa alone* is entitled to enter the
fourth stage of the Renunciate;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 564) to
the same effect;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 176),—which says that
‘*brāhmaṇa*’ here stands for all the twice-born persons;—and in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 65) which quotes ‘my grand-father’ to the effect
that ‘*brāhmaṇa*’ stands for all twice-born men,—while it itself favours
the view that it stands for the *Brāhmaṇa only*.
