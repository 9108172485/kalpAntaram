‘*Mātrā*’—‘Implements, vessels, staff and so forth’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘portion, mouthful’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 963), which explains ‘*mātrā*’
as ‘*upakaraṇadravyam*, accessories’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 563), which explains ‘*mātrā*’ etymologically as ‘*mīyante iti*’, as
meaning ‘objects’; since he is free from attachment to all objects,
therefore he should be neither glad at getting them nor sorry at not
getting them.
