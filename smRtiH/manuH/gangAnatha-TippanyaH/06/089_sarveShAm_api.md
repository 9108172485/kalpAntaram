**(verses 6.89)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 563), which
explains the meaning to be as follows:—As a matter of fact we find that
all the scriptures lay down in great detail the duties of the
Householder; hence this is recognised as superior to the other
life-stages;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 175).
