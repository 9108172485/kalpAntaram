‘*Āsām anyatamayā*’—‘The aforesaid austerities as also the *Great
Journey*’ (Medhātithi); so also ‘others.’ There is no difference of
opinion among the commentators, as Buhler makes out,

Hopkins is wrong in translating ‘*bhṛguprapāta*’ as ‘drowning;’—Buhler
has understood it rightly to mean ‘precipitating himself from a mount.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.55), winch adds the following
notes:—The ‘*brahmoloka*’ here meant is not ‘the eternal Brahman’, but a
particular *region*; otherwise there would be no sense in the adding of
the term ‘*loka*’; also because Liberation (which would be the ‘reaching
of the eternal Brahman’) is not held to be attained without the fourth
Life-stage of Renunciation; as is clear from the *Śruti* text
(Chāndogya) which speaks of the first three life-stages as
‘*puṇyalokāḥ*’, ‘leading to sacred regions’, and of the
‘*Brahmasaṃstha*’ (Renunciate) alone as attaining immortality.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 5.31);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 945), which adds that the ‘methods’ referred to are those
described under verse 23 *et. seq*. it adds that all that has been
prescribed under the ‘duties of the Religious Student’ has to be
followed by the Householder, the Hermit and the Renunciate also, in so
far as it does not militate against anything that has been prescribed
specifically for any of these.

It is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 398).
