This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57), to the effect that until
one has begotten offsprings he is not entitled to the life of
Renunciation;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 373);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
808), which says that ‘*mokṣa*’ here stands for *jñāna*, knowledge, as
is clear from the use of the term ‘*sevamānaḥ*’—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 3) along with the next verse (see below).
