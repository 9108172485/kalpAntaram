**(verses 6.87-93)**

“According to the commentators, the following discussion (87-93) is
introduced in order to show, (1) that there are four orders only, and
that the *Vedasannyāsika* belongs to these, and does not form a fifth
order, or stand outside the orders; (2) that as the order of the
Householders is most distinguished, it is proper that a man may continue
to live in his house under the protection of his son.”—Buhler.

**(verse 6.87)**

This verse is quoted in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 445), which explains
‘*gṛhasthaprabhavāḥ*’ as ‘dependent upon the Householder’;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 64), which has the same note;—and also in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 173).

**(verse 6.88)**

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 173), which says
that ‘*kramaśaḥ*’ indicates that any inversing of the order of the
Life-stages is forbiddenand in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 64), which has the
same note.
