‘*Anīśvarān guṇān*’—‘The three attributes of the Root Evolvent *i.e*.,
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas; these are *anīśvara*, *i.e*., dependent (upon
the Conscious Being) (Medhātithi);—‘qualities of anger, greed etc.,
which are *anīśvara*, *i.e*., do not reside in God’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda) qualities opposed to virtue, knowledge, dispassion and
power’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 41), which says that
what this verse mentions are
‘*Yama*—*niyama*—*āsana*—*prāṇāyāma*—*pratyāhāra—dhāraṇā* and *dhyāna*’,
all the accessories of Yoga except ‘Samādhi,’ which have been described
in the ordinances as the means of acquiring Right Knowledge.
