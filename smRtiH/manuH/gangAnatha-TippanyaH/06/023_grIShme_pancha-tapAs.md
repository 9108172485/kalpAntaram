to himself on his four sides and shall expose himself to the sun at the
head.

During the rainy season, he shall have the sky for his sole shelter;
*i.e*., he shall live in a place where the rain falls, and he shall not
hold the umbrella or any such thing to ward off the rain.

‘*During the winter*’,—*i.e*., whenever it is cold; *i.e*., during the
two seasons of *Hemanta* and *Śiśira* (Winter and Midwinter)—he shall
have his clothes wet.

‘*Gradually*’— In due course.—(23).
