This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 20), which explains
‘*brahmavedinaḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*brahmavādinaḥ*’) as
‘knowing the Brahman with properties’, which is clear from its being
mentioned along with ‘effulgent regions’ which could have no connection
with one who knows the absolute Brahman.

It is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 460).
