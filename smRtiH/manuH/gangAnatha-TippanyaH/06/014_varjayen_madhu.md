‘*Bhaumāni kavakāni*’—Medhātithi prefers to take the two
separately—‘*bhaumāni*’ being ‘the vegetable known among foresters’ as
‘*gojihvikā*’ and ‘*kavakāni*’ as ‘mushrooms’;—Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa take the two together ‘mushrooms growing on the ground.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 942);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 529), which explains ‘*Kavakāni*’ as ‘mushrooms.’
