‘*Yathāvidhi*’—‘By swallowing the ashes and so forth’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘by repeating the vedic text, Taittirīya
Saṃhitā 2.5.8.8’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 944), which explains ‘*niketa*’
as ‘home’,—‘*muni*’ as ‘observing silence,’—and adds that alms should be
begged only in the event of his being unable to obtain wild fruits and
roots,—as is clear from what follows in verse 27 below.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.54), which explains ‘*muniḥ*’ as
‘observing the vow of silence’; and adds that in the event of his being
unable to get roots and fruits, he may beg from the houses of other
hermits, just enough to keep himself alive.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 531).
