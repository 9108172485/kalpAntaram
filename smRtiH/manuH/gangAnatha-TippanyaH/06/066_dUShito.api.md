*Cf*. 3.50 and 12.102.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.65);—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 35), which reads *bhūṣitaḥ*’ for ‘*dūṣitaḥ*’,
explains it as ‘*adorned* with the staff and other signs of the
Remmciate’ and says that the particle ‘*api*’ implies that even when
without these, he should meditate upon the identity of the individual
and supreme selves.
