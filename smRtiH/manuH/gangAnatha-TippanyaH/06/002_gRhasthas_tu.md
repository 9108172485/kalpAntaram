“Medhātithi notes that the Śiṣṭas insist on the necessity that he who
takes to forest-life must have sons and son’s sons, and that hence
‘*apatya*’, ‘offspring,’ is to be taken in this restricted sense (of
*grandson*, not *grand-daughter*);—Nārāyaṇa holds that the verse gives
three separate grounds for entering the third order, each of which is
sufficient in itself; while Medhātithi thinks that the three conditions
must exist together—\[There is nothing in Medhātithi to indicate this\].
‘Others,’ mentioned by Medhātithi, took the verse to give a description
of the approach of old age, which entitles the house-holder to turn
hermit”—Buhler.

Medhātithi mentions,—but with disapproval—another explanation, by which
the whole verse serves only to indicate that one should take to the
hermit’s life neither ‘too early’ nor ‘too late.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* to the effect that one should retire
to the forest either when he has become decrepit with old age, or has
got a grandson in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 527);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 131);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 68b).
