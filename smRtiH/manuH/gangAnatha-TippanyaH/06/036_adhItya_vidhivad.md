This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 3) along with 35 which
has the following notes:—These two verses mean that a man who has not
already acquired dispassion towards worldly and celestial things should
do all things according to the scriptures and then have recourse to
Renunciation,—‘*vrajatyadhaḥ*’ *i.e*., lingers in the *satya* and other
regions lower than Liberation,—the *Jabāla śruti* justifies Renunciation
also for those who have not passed through all the preceding
life-stages.
