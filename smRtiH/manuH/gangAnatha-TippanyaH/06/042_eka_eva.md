This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 953), which explains ‘*siddhim na
jahāti*’ as ‘he is not abandoned by success’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 557), which adds the following explanation:—Coming to the
conclusion that when a man moves about alone, without a companion, he is
free from any such obstacles as attachment aversion and the like, and
thus becomes enabled to attain ‘success’ in the shape of True
Knowledge;—*i.e*., he acts without shackles towards its attainment; and
of that success lie is not deprived, *i.e*., he attains it. If, on the
other hand, he moves about with two or three companions, then he becomes
liable to attachment and aversion, and by reason of these obstacles, he
fails to attain that success.
