The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.57) to the
effect that the Brāhmaṇa only is entitled to the life of Renunciation.

The verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 538), in the sense
that when going to enter the stage of Renunciation, the man should
perform the Prājāpatya sacrifice in which he should give away all his
belongings as the ‘sacrificial fee’;—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p.
13).
