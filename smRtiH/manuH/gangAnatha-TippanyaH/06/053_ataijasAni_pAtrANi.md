This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Ācāra, p. 567);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 3.60), which remarks that the citing of the instance of
‘Cups at the sacrifice’ indicates that the vessels may be considered
*pure* for practical purposes;—in *Āparārka*, (p. 964);—in
*Madanapārijāta*, (p. 377);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasādā*, (Saṃskāra, p. 70b);—and
in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha*, (p. 78), which shows that the example of
‘*chamasa*’ indicates that the things are ‘clean’ only so far as to be
used.
