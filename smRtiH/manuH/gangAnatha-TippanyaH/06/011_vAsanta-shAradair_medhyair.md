This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.46), which notes that even
though the ‘*munyanna*’ is by nature pure, yet the text has added the
epithet ‘*medhya*’ with a view to indicate that the grains should be
*fit for being offered at a sacrifice*;—and in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 528), which explains ‘*munyanna*’ as ‘uncultivated grains,’ and
‘*medhya*’ as ‘fit for being offered at sacrifices.’
