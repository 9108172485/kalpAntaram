‘*Saptadvāra*’—(*a*) (1) Dharma-Artha, (2) Dharma-Kāma, (3) Artha-Kama,
(4) Kāma-Artha, (5) Kāma-Dharma, (6) Artha-Dharma, (7)
Dharma-Artha-Kāma;—or (*b*) The seven life-breath in the head;—or (*d*)
‘the six sense-organs and Buddhi’ (Medhātithi);—Kullūka has only
(*c*);—‘the five senses, mind and Ahaṅkāra’ (Nārāyaṇa);—Govindarāja has
(*a*) only;—‘seven worlds’ (mentioned by Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 954), which, reading *na vācam
samudīrayet* (for *na vācamanṛtam vadet*) explains this much
misunderstood second line as—he should not utter words vitiated by (1)
desire, (2) anger, (3) greed, (4) delusion, (5) arrogance, (6) jealousy
and (7) vanity.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 569).
