‘*Yuktaḥ*’—‘Intent on the practice of yoga’ (Govindarāja and
Kullūka),—‘firmly resolved’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānaṇda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 945), which adds the following
notes:—‘*yuktaḥ*’ means ‘*samāhitaḥ*’, ‘intent, calm, collected’; this
teaching regarding the ‘Great Journey’ is only by way of an illustration
for all such means of self-immolation as burning, drowning and the like.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.55);—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
1660), which explains ‘*aparājitā*’ as ‘the north-easterly
direction,’—towards that he should go straight on, till his body falls,
living upon water and air and with mind duly concentrated and calm.
