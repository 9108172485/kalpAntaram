‘*Yadetadabhiśabditam*’—‘What has been described in the immediately
preceding *verses*’ (Medhātithi);—‘what has been described in the
preceding *one verse*’ (Kullūka);—‘what has been described in all the
preceding *chapters*’ (Govindarāja and Nandana);—‘what can be expressed
by words’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Kriyāphalam*’—‘The reward of fulfilling the duties of the Renunciate’
(Medhātithi);—‘reward of the act of meditation’ (Kullūka);—‘reward of
the performance of rites’ (Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

Buhler has misunderstood Kullūka, who does not explain ‘*adhiyajñam*’ as
‘*Brahma-veda*’; he explains it as *yajñam adhikṛtya pravṛttam brahma
vedam*’—where ‘*brahma*’ of the text is explained as ‘*veda*’.
