This verse lends support to the view that one should pass through all
the life-stages.—‘*Passing from stage to stage*; that is passing from
the Householder’s stage to that of the Hermit.

‘*After offering the sacrifices*’—during both the stages.

‘*With senses subdued*’.—when he becomes so, then alone he should go
forth.

‘*If he dies*, *then he prospers*’—‘*i*. *e*., obtains most excellent
for splendour,

‘*Tired of alms and offerings*’—by having recourse to these along time.

This is reiterative reference to the duties of the Life-stages.—(35).
