‘*Iyam*’.—According to some this refers to [verse
72](/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc201950.html),
and these people hold that “in the case of wilful murder the penance has
to be made severer by doubling or trebling the term of twelve
years.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.226), where it is put forward (by
the Pūrvapakṣin) in support of the view that in the case of *wilful*
murder there is no expiation at all;—but the *Siddhānta* view is that
‘*iyam*’ refers to the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance mentioned before (verse
72), and the latter half of the verse does not entirely deny all
expiation; since several texts have definitely prescribed *expiation* by
death in such cases.—It is quoted again under 3.243, in support of the
view that the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance is meant to meet cases of
unintentional murder;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 77);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 2a);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 354), which
says that this precludes only the ‘Twelve Years Penance,’ and not all
kinds of expiation, as *suicide* is actually laid down as the expiation
for intentional Brāhmaṇa-murder;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 65),
wḥich says that the meaning is that the ‘Twelve Years’ and other
penances are precluded from intentional Brāhmaṇa-murder, and the
implication is that there is no expiation for it.
