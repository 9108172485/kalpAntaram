This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 909), which notes that
(*a*) according to *Aparārkā* the ‘*ājya—homa*’ should begin with
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and end with ‘*Vahnayesvāhā*’ and after these
‘Principal offerings’ there should be one more offering of *Ājya* with
the mantra ‘*Samāsiñcantu etc*.’—(*b*) while according to
*Smṛtimañjarī*, after the ‘Principal offerings,’ the offering of
clarified butter with the mantra ‘*Samasiñcantu etc*.’ should be made to
Suvarchala and other deities;—so that in view of these two views, this
is a case of option.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 436);—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 1140), which adds the following notes:—The first
offerings to be made are the offerings of *Ājya* with the mantras
‘*Vātāya svāhā*’ and so forth;—the time for the offering is the ‘night,’
and that on the *Amāvāṣyā* day.
