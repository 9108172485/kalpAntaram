This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), which explains that
‘*payaḥ*’ here stands for *milk*;—again on p. 1160, where it is added
that this refers to cases where the water has been drunk and vomitted by
women or children, and it was contained in a vessel that had contained
wine, hut was not wet with it, so that the water had not imbibed either
the taste or the smell of the liquor.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 349), which adds that
this refers to cases of unintentional repeated drinking of the
water;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 324), which says that ‘*payaḥ*’
means *milk*; ‘*Śaṅkhapuṣpī*’ is a particular herb.
