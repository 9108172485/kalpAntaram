‘*Vṛṣalī*’—‘*Cāṇḍālī*’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘a Śūdra woman’
(Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.260), which explains ‘*vṛṣalī*’
as *Cāṇḍālī*;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 363), which says that this
lays down the expiation for the marrying of a *Śūdra girl, in a manner
not sanctioned by the scriptures*.
