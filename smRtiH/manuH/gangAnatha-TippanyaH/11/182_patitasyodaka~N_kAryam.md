This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 964), which explains
‘*nindite ahani*’ as on the 4th or 9th or 14th day of the month; and
such other forbidden days;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 408);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1206);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 295), to the effect that the rites in
question are to be performed near elders during the fifth part of the
day and on such forbidden days as the 4th or 9th or 14th of the month.
