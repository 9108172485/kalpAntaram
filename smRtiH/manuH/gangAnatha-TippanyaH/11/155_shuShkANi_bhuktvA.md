‘*Ajñātam*’.—‘Unknown’ (Medhātithi);—‘unintentionally’ (Govindarāja and
Rāghavānanda); ‘*Bhaumāni kavakāni*’.—To be taken together according to
Medhātithi; separately, according to Rāghavānanda, who takes
‘*bhaumāni*’ as ‘mushrooms growing on the ground,’ and ‘*Kavakānī*’ as
‘mushrooms growing on trees’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1166), which adds that the
expiation here prescribed is for the eating of mushrooms growing on the
ground, not those growing on trees;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 285).
