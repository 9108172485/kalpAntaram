This is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which adds that since the
expiation here prescribed is thrice as heavy ns that prescribed in the
proceeding verse, the ‘grass’ and other things mentioned here should be
taken to be of that quantity which would be obtainable at a price three
times that of the single meal.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1110), which notes that this refers to
the stealing of ‘grass’ and other things whose value is three times that
of the single meal of one man;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 875);—and in
*Prāyaścittviveka* (p. 345), which explains ‘*Śuṣkānna*’ as ‘rice &c.’,
and adds that the ‘two days penance’ is for stealing grains sufficient
for two meals, for stealing more than that, there should be heavier
expiation.
