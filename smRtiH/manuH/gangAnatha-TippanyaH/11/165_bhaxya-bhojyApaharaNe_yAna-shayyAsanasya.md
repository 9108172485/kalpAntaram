This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as referring to cases where
the quantity of food stolen is just enough for one meal;—and in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 875), which has the same note, and adds that, in as
much as the ‘conveyance’ and other things have been mentioned in the
same context, these also should he understood to be of just that value
which would be equivalent to the value of a single meal.
