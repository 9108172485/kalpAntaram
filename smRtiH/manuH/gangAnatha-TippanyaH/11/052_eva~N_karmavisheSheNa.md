**(verse 11.51)**

‘*Vāgapahārakaḥ*.’—‘Stealer of speech’,—*i.e*., one who learns the Veda
by stealth’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘a plagiarist’
(Nārāyaṇa).

\[*The additional verse, relating to the ‘stealer of a lamp’ has been
translated by Buhler as part of the text; it has been so accepted by
Rāghavānanda and Rāmacandra, but not by the other commentators. We have
followed the text of Medhātithi here; hence from this verse onward our
verse-numbering will be one less than that in Buhler*\], This additional
verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 248).
