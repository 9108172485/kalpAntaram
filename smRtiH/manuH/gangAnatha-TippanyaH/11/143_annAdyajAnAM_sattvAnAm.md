This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1138), which adds that ‘*ghāte*,’
‘on cutting,’ is to be construed with

this verse;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 242), which explains
‘*anādya*’ as *śaktu* and the rest,—‘*rasa*’ as ‘molasses and the
like,’—‘*phala*’ as ‘the jujube and so forth,’—‘*puṣpa*’ as the
*Madhūka* and the rest,—if one kills the insects produced in these
things *unintentionally*, one should eat clarified butter and then fast
for a day.
