title = "190 बालघ्नांश् च"

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1209), which remarks that the
phrase ‘*viśuddhānapi dharmataḥ*’ clearly indicates that the expiations
laid down in connection with the murder of women and other crimes do
really serve to remove the sin involved.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 155), as indication
of the view that in the case of heinous crimes, even after the
prescribed expiration has been gone through, the offender is not fit for
being associated with, even though for all spiritual purposes he may
have become ‘purified’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 21);—and in
*Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 109), which explains ‘*na saṃvaset*’ to mean
that ‘one should not associate with them in eating or any such act.’
