This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), as implying that it is for
the Brāhmaṇa alone that all the three kinds of liquor are equally
forbidden;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1069), to the effect that (*a*) the *Surā*
is to be avoided by all the twice-born, even before initiation, (*b*)
the *Mādhvī* and the *Gauḍī* are to be avoided by the Brāhmaṇa at all
times, but by the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya only during the period of
studentship.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 225);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika
548);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 814), to the effect that the *Mādhvī* and
the *Gauḍī* are forbidden only for the Brāhmaṇa, not for the Kṣatriya
and the Vaiśya; but they are forbidden for all the three higher castes
during the period of studentship;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 355).
