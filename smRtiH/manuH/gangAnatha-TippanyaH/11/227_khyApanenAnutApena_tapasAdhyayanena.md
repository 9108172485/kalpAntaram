This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 483);—in *Pāraśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 336);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 29), which says
that the mention of ‘*āpadi*’ implies that ‘making gifts’ is the
secondary alternative for ‘Vedic study and austerities’; and notes that
this refers to sins other than that of *killing*.
