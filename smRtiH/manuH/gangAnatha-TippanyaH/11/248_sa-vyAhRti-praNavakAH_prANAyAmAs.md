This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.302), which adds that this refers
to cases where the penetint is unable to give cows;—and in *Aparārka*
(p. 44 and p. 1216), which adds that this is destructive of all heinous
offences; and declares that what is here expressly stated implies also
such observances as celibacy, truthfulness, sleeping on the ground,
eating only *haviṣya* food and so forth.
