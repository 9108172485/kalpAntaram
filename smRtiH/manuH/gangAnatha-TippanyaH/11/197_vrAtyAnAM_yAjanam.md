This verse is quoted in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 383);—in *Aparārka* (p.
1152), which explains ‘*antya karma*’ as the ‘*antyeṣṭi*,’ and adds that
this refers to one who does the acts on hire, and not merely with a
religious motive; and that it refers to the Brāhmaṇa who performs the
death-rites for the Kṣatriya and other castes;—the ‘*Ahīna*’ is the name
for all those *Ahargaṇa* sacrifices which begin with the ‘*Dvirātra*’
and end with the ‘*Dvādaśarātra*.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 429), as laying down
the expiation for officiating at sacrifices performed by those who
should not perform them;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 917), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Antya karma*,’ the rites performed on the
cremation ground,—‘*pareṣām*,’ *non-sapiṇḍas* or *śūdras*,—in the case
of the former it is repetition that is reprehensible, and in that of the
latter, even the first act;—‘*abhicāra*,’ ‘murderous rite,’ is
reprehensible, when it is performed against one who has not done any
similar act against the man;—the ‘*Ahīna*’ is a particular kind of
sacrifice.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 122);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 247), which says that, as ‘*hīna*’ means ‘unrighteous,’ ‘*ahīna*’
means ‘righteous,’ and hence what is forbidden is ‘magical rites against
righteous persons.’
