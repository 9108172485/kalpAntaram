‘*Svarjitā*.’—‘*Svarjit*’ is the name of a sacrifice, according to
Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka;—according to others the term is only an epithet of
‘*gosavena*.’

‘*Trivṛtā*’.—Qualifies the ‘Agniṣṭut’, according to Medhātithi;—but
stands for a distinct sacrifice, the *Trivṛtstoma*, according to
Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa.

For the *Gosava* see Kātyāyana-śrautasūtra 22.11.3 for the *Ābhijit*,
Āśvalāyana-śrautasūtra 8.5.13;—for the *Agniṣṭut*, Ibid 9.7.22—25.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.248);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 405).
