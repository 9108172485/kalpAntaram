This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.259), which offers the following
explanation:—He should himself cut off his testicles and the organ, take
them in his hands and go away straight onwards towards the South-West,
till his body falls off; it adds that the man should go towards the
South-West backwards and with eyes bandaged.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 836), which also adds that the man
should go backwards and with eyes closed;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1083);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 253);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 11a);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 137), which says
that the ‘cutting’ should be done with a *razor* as distinctly
prescribed by *Śaṅkha-Likhita*.
