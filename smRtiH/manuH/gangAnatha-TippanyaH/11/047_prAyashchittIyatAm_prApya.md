This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 774), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Daivāt*,’ *i.e*., for the sake of some offence
committed during the present life,—or for that of some offence the
antenatal committing of which is indicated by the presence, in the
person, of such defects as consumption, rotten nails, black teeth and so
forth,—one should perform the expiatory rites prescribed by Vaśiṣṭha;
but the expiation performed should be that prescribed for the presence
of the said defects, not that for the offences of which those defects
are known to be the effects,—e.g. the presence of rotten nails has been
held to he the effect of stealing gold in a previous life, or
consumption is held to be the effect of Brāhmaṇa-slaughter committed in
a previous life.

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 2a);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 141 and 148), as forbidding association with
sinners.
