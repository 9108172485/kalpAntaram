‘*Ṛkṣatam* (*Ṛcśatam*?).’—‘One hundred verses, the *Gāyatrī* and the
like’ (Kullūka);—‘the *Gāyatrī* itself repeated a hundred times’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.276);—in *Parā* *sha* *ramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 434), which notes that this refers to the cutting of
trees etc., other than that for sacrificial purposes;—in *Aparārka* (p.
1134), which notes that ‘*puṣpitānām*’ goes with ‘*vīrudhām*’;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 920), which notes that there is nothing wrong in
cutting the trees etc., for the purposes of the five great sacrifices
and other religious purpose;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 243), which
says that this refers to the cutting of trees with very few fruits.
