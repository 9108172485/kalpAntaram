title = "140 अस्थिमतान् तु"

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaś chitta, p. 66);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 241), which explains the meaning to be that for
the *unintentional* killing of 1,000 insects with bones, or a cartful of
boneless insects, one should perform the ‘six-montly penance’, which
Manu has prescribed in connection with the killing of a Śūdra; if it is
done *intentionally*, then the ‘one year penance’ is to be performed.
