This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.254), as referring to eases where
the twice-born eats *dry* grain which has come into contact with
liquor;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), where ‘*surāsaṃspṛṣṭam*’ is explained
as ‘that in which the taste of liquor is absent *e.g*. water contained
in a vessel which had contained liquor; the eating of what bears the
taste of liquor being as bad as the drinking of liquor itself; it adds
that here also the re-initiation is to *follow* the prescribed expiatory
rites;—again on p. 1164;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 191) in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 488);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra p. 545);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 298);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
104);—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 279), which says that the ‘*punaḥ
saṃskāra*,’ is always to be preceded by the performance of the
*Tapta-Kṛcchra*.
