**(verses 11.218-219)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1243);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.325),
which add that in the *Yaticāndrā-yaṇa* and other penances, it is not
necessary to follow the movements of the moon; so that there would be no
harm if the beginning were made on even the fifth day of the *lunar*
month, if that happened to be the first day of the *solar* month;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 517).
