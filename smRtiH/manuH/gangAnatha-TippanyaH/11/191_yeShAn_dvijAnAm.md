This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 433), as
laying down the expiation for the ‘*Vrātya*’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
871), which adds that—(*a*) in the case of the omission being due to the
absence of an initiator, the expiation should he that prescribed by Manu
and Yājñavalkya, and (*b*) in the case of omission being due to no such
unavoidable circumstances, nor in times of digress, it should be ‘Three
Years’ Penance’ prescribed under the section on cow-slaughter.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1107), which explains ‘*trīn kṛcchrān*’
as meaning—(1) The *Prājāpatya*, (2) the *Kṛcchra* and (3) the
*Atikṛcchra*;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as laying down what should be done
when one has become a ‘*vrātya*’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
350);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 384.)
