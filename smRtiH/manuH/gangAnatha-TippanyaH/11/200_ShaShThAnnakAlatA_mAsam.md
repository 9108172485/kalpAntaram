See above 3.151 *et. seq*. for ‘*Apāṅktyas*’; and
*Śuklayajurveda-saṃhitā* (8.13) for the *Śākala-homas*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1158), which notes that the
‘*Apāṅktyas’'* have been described by Manu himself under the section on
‘*śrāddhas*’;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (3.286), and again under 3.289, where
it is added that the particular expiation to be performed is to be
determined by considerations of the caste of the offender and such other
circumstances.
