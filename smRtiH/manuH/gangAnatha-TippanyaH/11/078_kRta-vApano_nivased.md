+++
This verse lays down an option regarding observances during the twelve
years of penance (verse 72)—according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa it provides a general rule for all
penances.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.243), which cays that this is an
option to what has been said in verse 72;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 788),
which also adds that this lays down an option;—and in *parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, pp. 399-400), which notes that the ‘*vā*’ of the
‘*Kṛtavāpanaḥ*’ indicates that ‘shaving’ is an option to the wearing of
matted locks.
