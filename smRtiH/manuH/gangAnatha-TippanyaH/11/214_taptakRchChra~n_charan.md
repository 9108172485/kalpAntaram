This v erse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 735), which explains the
meaning to be that ‘he should live for three days each upon water, milk,
and clarified butter and air’;—thus the penance being Completed in
twelve days;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 511), which says that the
‘drinking of hot air’ is done by inhaling the vapour emanating from hot
milk; and that this penance is completed in *twelve* days;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 782);—and in *Yatidharmasaṅgraha* (p. 7).
