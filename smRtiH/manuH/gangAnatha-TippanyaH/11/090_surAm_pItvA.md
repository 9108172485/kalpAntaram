The liquor Here meant is that distilled from ground grains, according to
Medhātithi, Govindarāja And Kullūka;—according to Nārāyaṇa the
death-penance is meant for all twice-born men partaking of liquor
distilled from grains, and by Brāhmaṇas who have drunk any of the three
kinds of liquor described under verse 95.

‘*Mohāt*’.—Nandana reads ‘*amohāt*’ and explains it as ‘not
unintentionally’, ‘intentionally.’

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), which explains ‘*mohāt*’ as
meaning ‘ignorance of scriptural injunctions’.—It enters into a long
discussion regarding the exact connotation in the present context, of
the term ‘*surā*,’ and comes to the conclusion that it stands for the
liquor distilled from ground grains; the partaking of which is equally
heinous for all the three higher castes,—the drinking of the other two
kinds, that distilled from molasses and that from honey, being sinful
for the Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 815), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Mohāt*’ stands for ‘ignorance of the scriptures,’ and not for
‘ignorance of the nature of the liquid drunk’;—‘*agnivarṇām*,’ ‘heated
to the extent of becoming red-hot’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta
9a);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 93), which explains ‘*agnivarṇām*’
as ‘hot as fire,’ and quotes Jikana to the effect that ‘*mohāt*’ means
‘intentionally.’
