This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 67);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 1132), which explains ‘*palāla*’ as paddy-stalks without
grains;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3. 273);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 950), which
adds that the ‘*palālabhāra*’ and ‘one *māṣa* of *Sīsaka*’ are optional
alternatives;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 527), which says that the
gift prescribed removes the sin of the killing.
