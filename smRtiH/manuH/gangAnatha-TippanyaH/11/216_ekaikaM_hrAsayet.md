This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 240), as
laying down the ‘three times bathing’ as part of the ‘*Cāndrāyāṇa*’
penance;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 742), where ‘*triṣavaṇam*’ is explained
as the three ‘*sandhyās*’, morning, evening and mid-day;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1243), which adds that this penance is called ‘barley-shaped’ and
‘ant-shaped’, the latter when it is begun on the first day of the darker
fortnight;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 516).
