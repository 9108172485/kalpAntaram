The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.70), and again
under 3.265, as laying down the ‘Three Years’ Penance’ and such other
penances for the woman’s offence of adultery with a man of the higher
caste;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 98);—and the first half is quoted in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 285), which explains that the first
half of the verse lays down what is to be done by the husband of the
offending woman, and the second half what is to be done by the woman
herself;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 370), which says that the
meaning is that the husband should keep her in a room, without toilet or
bath, meanly dressed, sleeping on the ground, with food just enough to
keep her alive,—all this till her next menstruation.
