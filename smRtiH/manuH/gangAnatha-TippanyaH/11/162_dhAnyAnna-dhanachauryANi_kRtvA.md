This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3. 265);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
874), which adds the following notes:—‘*Dhana*’ stands for valuables
other than gold,—‘*dvijottama*,’ Brāhmaṇa,—his ‘*svajāti*’ is
Brāhmaṇa;—this refers to cases where the Brāhmaṇa has stolen;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 427);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
342), which explains ‘*anna*’ as *cooked* food, and ‘*dhana*’ as cattle.
