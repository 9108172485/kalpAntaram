This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.249), to the effect that the food
to be eaten should be ‘*haviṣya*’ only;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 1060),
which adds that ‘*niyatāhāra*’ means that the food should be either
small in quantity or of ‘*haviṣya*’ kind only;—the man becomes purified
by reciting the text of the Veda three times,—or by being restrained in
food and going along the Sarasvatī from its mouth upwards to its source.
