This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 436);—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 507);—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 191);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 554);—in *Aparārkā* (p. 1140), which notes
that what is emphasised here is (*a*) that the ass should be one-eyed,
and (*b*) that the entire procedure of the *Pākayajña* sacrifice laid
down in *Gṛhyasūtra* should be carried out;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
909), which explains ‘*pākayajñavidhānena*’ as the entire procedure
consisting of the ‘*Parisam* *ū* *hana*’ and ‘*Paryukṣaṇa*’ and ending
with the ‘Principal offerings’ to *Vāta* and the other deities;—it notes
that the ‘night’ meant is that of *Amāvāṣyā* day;—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 363).
