‘*Anirdeśyam*.’—‘What is stated in the first half is not to be
prescribed in the case of the *intentional* drinking of Vāruṇī’
(Medhātithi and Nandana);—‘Any expiation involving death shall not be
prescribed even in the wise of the intentional drinking of Vāruṇī’
(Nārāyaṇa and others.)

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1074), which explains the meaning
to be—‘The intentional drinking of *Surā* is an offence for which no
expiation can be prescribed by any Assembly; it has to be found out by
the offender himself.’ It adds that the re-performance of the
sacramental rites in itself cannot absolve the man from the sin; these
rites have to be performed after the man has undergone the expiation
specifically prescribed for wine-drinking.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.255), which adds that the sacramental
rites are to be performed after the performance of the *Tapta-Kṛcchra*.

It is quoted in *Parāyaścittaviveka* (p. 100), which explains the second
half to mean that ‘if one drinks wine *intentionally*, then the
expiation just prescribed will not serve his purpose his only expiation
will consist in giving up his life.’
