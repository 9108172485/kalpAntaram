This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 851), which notes that in
all these cases the lightness or heaviness of the expiation will depend
upon the caste and capacity of the person concerned;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.261);—in *Parāśaramadhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 23), which defines
‘*saṃsarga*’ as travelling together, sitting together and so forth;—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 141 and 165), which says that this refers to
the *Mahāpātakas* only,—and that ‘*Patita*’ here stands for the mere
‘offender’ or ‘sinner’ (not literally, the *outcast*);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 356).
