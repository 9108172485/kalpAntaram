This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 809):—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (pp.
84 and 345);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 579);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 957), to the effect that in the ease of the omission of those
*Śrauta* and *Smāṛta* rites for which, no specific expiation is
prescribed, the *fasting* here laid down series as the expiation; and
where a specific expiation has been prescribed, it has to be done *along
with* this fasting;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1188), which explains
‘*abhojanam*’ as *fasting*, and adds the same note as the above;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 443), which adds that this fasting has
to he done along with the rites specifically prescribed;—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.242);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 286 and 368), which says that this
refers to a single omission,—and explains ‘*Snātaka*’ as
‘house-holder’;—and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 357), which says that
this refers to cases of *unintentional* omission.
