title = "128 त्र्यब्दञ् चरेद्"

+++
According to Medhātithi and Rāghavānanda this verse only reiterates what
has been prescribed in verse 126, all the details of which are meant to
be observed in the present connection;—but according to Govindarāja and
Kullūka, the special details, of carrying the skull and so forth, which
are not expressly mentioned here, are not meant here.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 128);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 216 and 534).
