This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.254), which adds that this refers
to a case where wine has been drunk by mistake and then vomitted;—again,
as referring to a case where the, wine has been taken unitentionally but
thrown out, after it has merely touched the palate.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 412), to the same
effect,—*i.e*. as referring to a case where the wine has only touched
the palate;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 9b);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 98), which says that this refers either to cases
of *unintentional* but repeated drinking of the *Gauḍī* and *Mādhvī*
wines, or to those of *intentional* drinking, only once, of those wines.
