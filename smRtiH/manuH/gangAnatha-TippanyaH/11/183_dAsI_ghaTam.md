This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 964), which explains
‘*pretarat*’ as wearing the upper cloth over the right shoulder and so
forth;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.295), to the effect that the slave-girl may
make the offerings under orders of the paternal relations of the
outcast—it explains ‘*pretavat*’ as implying that the offender should
face the south, wear the upper cloth over the right shoulder and so
forth;—and in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 408).
