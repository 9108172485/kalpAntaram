“According to Nārāyaṇa this verse refers to an unintentional offence;
according to Kullūka and Rāghvānanda, to the theft of a small
sum.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 415), as
describing the ‘austerity’ mentioned in the preceding verse;—and in
*Aparārka* (p. 1080), which remarks that this refers to a case where the
gold stolen belonged to a Brāhmaṇa devoid of good qualities, or where
the theft has been committed by a Brāhmaṇa possessing good qualities in
times of distress for the support of his family;—and that in a case
where one without qualities has stolen gold belonging; to a Brāhmaṇa
with good qualities, in large quantities, or for such evil purposes as
gambling and the like, the expiation must be one that ends in the
culprit’s death.
