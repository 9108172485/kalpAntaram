The first half of this verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 399).

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 787);—in *Aparārka* (p. 1053), to
the effect that the man should place a human skull on the top of a
flag;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.243), which explains the first half as
prescribing living in the forest and the phrase ‘*kṛtvā
śavaśirodhvajam*’ as meaning that the man shall carry a staff placing at
its top the skull of the man murdered by him;—in *Śuddhikaumdī* (p.
241), which says that the year meant here is the ‘*sāvana*’ one’;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 62 and 522), which says that he is to have
recourse to ‘begging alms’ only when wild growing fruits are not
available.
