This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 192), which has the
following notes—‘*Parivittitā*’, of the elder brother who remains
without wife and fire while his younger brother has taken
both,—‘*parivedana*’ of the younger brother, in the said
circumstances,—‘*ca*’ indicates that these two ‘offences’ apply in the
case of *sisters* also,—the marrying of one’s daughter to either of the
two persons just mentioned,—and officiating as priest at marriages and
other rites of the said two persons.
