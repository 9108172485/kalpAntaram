This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 192), which has the
following notes—‘*Vrātyatā*’, whose Upanayana has not been performed at
the prescribed age, and one who has not performed the
Soma-sacrifice,—‘*bāndhavatyāga*’, abandoning, without reason, of
*Sapiṇḍa* and other relatives,—‘*bhṛtakādhyāpana*’ (which is its reading
for ‘*bhṛtyādhyāpana*’,) imparting knowledge in exchange for wages
received—‘*bhṛtādhyayana*’, learning under a Teacher who teaches for
wages received,—‘*apaṇyānām vikrayaḥ*’ selling of lac and other things
even once, and repeated selling of milk and other things,—this is an
‘offence’ for the Brāhmaṇa.
