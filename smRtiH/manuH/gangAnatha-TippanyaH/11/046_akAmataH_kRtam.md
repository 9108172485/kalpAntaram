This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, (3.226), to the effect that the sin
accruing from ‘*non-degrading*’ offences even when intentional, is wiped
off by the performance of expiatory rites;—in *Aparārka*, (p. 1040)—in
*Madanapārijāta*, (p. 705);—in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p. 18), which says
that all that is meant by the mention of ‘*Vedabhyāsa*’ is that the
expiation of *unintentional* delinquencies is lighter than that for
*intentional* ones,—it explains ‘*pṛthagvidhaiḥ*’ as ‘other kinds of
expiation’;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra*, (p. 354).
