This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), which notes that it refers
to a case where the quantity of water stolen is such as could be
obtained for 250 *Panas*;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 876), which notes
that this refers to the stealing of men belonging to Kṣatriya and other
castes; the stealing of the Brāhmaṇa being regarded as on the same
footing as the stealing of gold;—‘*vāpi*’ and ‘*kūpa*’ have been added
as qualifications for the purpose of excluding water contained in jars
and other vessels. It quotes *Aparārka* as holding that the expiation
here prescribed refers to the ‘stealing’ of tanks and wells full of
water,—and also the above-mentioned remark of *Mitākṣarā*. It adds that
this expiation is to be performed after the stolen article has been
returned to the owner.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 344), which says that
‘*manuṣya*’ and ‘*strī*’ stand here for male and female slaves.
