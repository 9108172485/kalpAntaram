This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 348), which adds the
following notes:—By doing the act unintentionally the man ‘falls’,
‘*patati*’, *i.e*., becomes sinful; hence the repetition of the act
involves the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance—when done intentionally, the act
makes the man turn into the same caste; hence the repetition of this
would involve expiation by death; which however applies only to the act
repeated during a long period of time.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1121), which notes that the said
‘equality’ involves expiation by death;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 543);—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 88), as referring to eases of
intentional continuation of the act for a long time;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 160, 187, 258, 412), which says that this
prescribes the ‘Twelve Years’ Penance’ for the *unintentional* eating of
the Caṇḍāla’s food;—that the accepting of gifts also that is meant is
twenty-four unintentional repetitions of the acceptance.
