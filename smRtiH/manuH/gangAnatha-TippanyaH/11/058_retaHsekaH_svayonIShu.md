This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.231), to the effect that the
‘intercourse’ meant here is the actual consummation of the act, as is
clear from the use of the term ‘*retaḥseka*’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1048),
which also adds that if the intercourse ceases before actual emission,
the offence is not equal to the ‘violation of the Teacher’s bed—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 251), which adds that this refers to
cases where, the act is repeated for fifteen days;—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 844), which notes that the use of the expression ‘*retaḥseka*’
indicates that if the act ceases before emission, it involves an
expiation lighter than that in the case of ‘the violation of the
Teacher’s bed’;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 177), which has the
following notes—‘*Svayonyāsu*’, Sapiṇḍa-women, and such women as are
blood-relations of one’s father or mother,—‘*kumārīṣu*’ Brāhmaṇa
virgins,—‘*Antyajāsu*’, Caṇḍāla and other low-born girls,—‘*Sakhyuḥ
strīṣu*’, wives of Brāhmaṇa friends,—‘*putrastrīṣu*’, wives of sons born
of wives of different castes, or wives of sons other than the ‘body
born’.
