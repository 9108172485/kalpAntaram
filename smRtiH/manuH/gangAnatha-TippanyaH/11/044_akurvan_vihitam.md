This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.220), which notes that the use of
the general term ‘*naraḥ*’ implies that what is here said is applicable
to the ease of men born of reversed parentage; such general sins as
those of killing and the like being possible in their case also;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p. 50), which adds that the verse is indicative
of those sins that accrue from the omission, through sloth, of the
obligatory duties;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 6);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 10), which says that the meaning is that the act
is *sinful*, and hence involves expiation;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
351).
