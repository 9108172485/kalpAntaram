The two verses mentioned are Ṛgveda 1.24.14 and 7.89.5.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 993), which adds that as
the number of repetitions is not mentioned, the texts have to be recited
at all times, except when the man’s time may be taken up by other
necessary acts;—it remarks that what is stated here refers to cases of
repeated offence.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.306), which makes the same remarks as
*Madanapārijāta*.
