This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 748)—which adds the
following notes:—Thrice during the day and thrice during the night; this
rule regarding six baths is applicable to those fit for it physically;
so that the number of baths may be increased or decreased. In
*Tapta-Kṛcchra* penance there is a single hath;—in *Aparārka* (p.
1230);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 38a).
