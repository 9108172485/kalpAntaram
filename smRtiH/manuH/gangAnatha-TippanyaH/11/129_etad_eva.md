“According to Govindarāja and Kullūka, the two penances are to be
performed optionally, in case a virtuous Vaiśya has been killed
unintentionally.—Medhātithi says that the first penance is to be
performed for the murder of a Vaiśya who was less distinguished than the
one referred to in verse 126.—Nārāyaṇa thinks that the verse refers to a
Vaiśya engaged in the performance of a sacrifice, and that the particle
‘*vā*’ takes the place of the?upola, and thus one penance only is
prescribed.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 216 and 534), which
explains ‘*ekaśatam*’ as ‘a hundred and one’.
