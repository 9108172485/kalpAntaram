**(verse 11.16)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 275), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Bhakta*’ is food; ‘*saptame bhakte*,’ on the
fourth day;—‘*aśvastanavidhānena*,’ in such a way that there may be
nothing left over for the second day;—‘*hīnakarmaṇaḥ*,’ from a man whose
religious acts are very poor.—It is quoted again under (2.43), whíere
the meaning is explained as that ‘if, in the absence of food, a man has
gone without food for three days, he should wrest from a man deficient
in religious acts just enough for one day.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 938), which explains the meaning as—‘if a
man has gone without food for six meals, then at the time of his seventh
meal, he should take by force just enough for the day from a man of
lower caste and also from one who is deficient in religious acts.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 352), to the effect that if a man
has gone without six meals, he may steal food; and notes that this
sanction implies that one may even perform the Vaiśvadeva rites with
such stolen food.

**(verse 11.17)**

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.43), to the effect that if, under
circumstances mentioned in the preceding verse, one has stolen food, he
should confess if asked;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 938), to the effect that
the food spoken of in the preceding verse, may be taken from the
threshing-yard and other places.
