‘*Ninditānna*.’—‘Forbidden food’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—‘food given
by persons from whom it should not be accepted, *e.g*. by a king, a
gambler and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa, Raghavānanda and Nandana).’

This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 192), which has the
following notes—The cutting of many trees for purposes of fuel,—cooking
for one’s own benefit, not for the purpose of offerings to
Viśvedevas,—‘*ninditānna*,’ the food given by tribes or thieves and such
people.
