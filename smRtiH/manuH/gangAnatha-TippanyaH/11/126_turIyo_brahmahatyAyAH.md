This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.266-267), as referring to such
Vaiśyas and Śūdras as are possessed of only a few good qualities;—it
explains the term ‘*vṛtta*’ as qualities of the heart and so forth, such
as ‘reverence for superiors, purity, cleanliness, truthfulness, control
of organs and goodwill towards all’;—and in the *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p.
215).
