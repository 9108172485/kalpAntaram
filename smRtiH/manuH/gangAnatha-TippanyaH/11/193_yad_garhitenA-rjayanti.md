This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* ĪI (p. 476);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 49);—in *Aparārka* (p. 1150);—in *Mitākṣarā*
(3.290), which adds that this surrendering should be done in every ease
before the performance of the expiation specially prescribed for the
act;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 925), which notes that ‘*japyena*’ refers
to the 300 repetitions of the *Sāvitrī* laid down in the next verse;—in
*Śrāddhakriyākaumudī* (p. 222), which says that, this clearly implies
that the religious act, that the man does with the ill-gotten wealth
also becomes vitiated to that extent;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 403
and 415);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra 165a), to the effect when a
man acquires property by methods not sanctioned by the scriptures, he
does not obtain any legal possession of that property, and hence his
sons also have no claims to inherit that, property.
