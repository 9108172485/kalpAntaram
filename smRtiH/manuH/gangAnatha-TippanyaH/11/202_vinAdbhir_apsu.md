This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.293), which adds the following
notes—‘*Vinā adbhiḥ*’, when there is no water near at hand,—‘*śārīram*,’
the passing of urine and stools;—it adds that this refers to cases where
the act has been done *unintentionally*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1187), which explains ‘*Śārīram*’ as the
passing of urine and stools;—and in the *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 456),
which explains ‘*Śārīram*’ as ‘the passing of urine or stools,’ and says
that it refers to cases where the man omits the use of water on account
of dire urgency.
