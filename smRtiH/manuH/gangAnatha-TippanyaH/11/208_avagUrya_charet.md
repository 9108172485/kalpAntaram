This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 479);—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.280),
which remarks that when bleeding is brought about, it must involve both
‘threatening’ (*avagūraṇa*) and ‘striking’ (*nipātana*),—as without
these there could be no *wounding* but in the case of bleeding, the
expiation would be ‘*Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*’ (which is prescribed for the
bleeding), and not ‘*Kṛcchra*’ and ‘*Atikṛcchra*’ also (which are
prescribed separately for ‘threatening’ and ‘striking’
respectively);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 464).
