*Cf*. Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.28.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 705), which quotes a Vedic
text to the effect that once Indra gave away certain sages to be
devoured by the ‘*Śālāvṛka*’ dogs, for which sinful act Prajāpati
ordained for him the expiatory rite called ‘Upahavya’, which is taken as
implying that for *intentional* offences also there is ‘expiation.’.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, (3.226), as indicating that expiatory rites
are to be performed in the case of intentional offences also,—and *not*
that the sin accruing from such offences is wiped off by these rites, in
the case of ‘degrading’ offences.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Prāyaścitta, p. 152), to the effect
that in the case of intentional offences, there can be expiation, only
according to some authorities, not all;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*, (p.
18), which says that stress is meant to the laid upon ‘*akāmakāḥ*’ as it
is only for *unintentional* delinquencies that there is expiation, and
in reference to ‘*Śrutividarśanāt*,’ it quotes the Śruti-passage
describing the story of Indra and the Śālavṛkas.
