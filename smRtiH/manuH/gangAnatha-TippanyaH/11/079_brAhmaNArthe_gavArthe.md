This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 797), which adds the
following explanation:—Here the text lays down separately, (*a*)
‘immediate surrendering of his life for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa,’ and
(*b*) ‘saving of the cow and the Brāhmaṇa’; from which it follows
that—(*a*) if the man succeeds in saving the cow or the Brāhmaṇa, he
becomes purified, even though his own life may have been saved, and
(*b*) even though he may not succeed in saving the cow or the Bārhmaṇa,
he becomes purified, if he has tried his best and lost his life in the
attempt to save them.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1058), which adds the following
notes:—This is to be taken in connection with the ‘Twelve years
penance’; even though the man may not succeed in saving the cow or the
Brāhmaṇa, if he has tried his best, and perishes in the attempt, he
becomes purified; and if he has succeeded in saving them, he becomes
purified, even though he may not have lost his life in the attempt.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.244), which adds that ‘saving the
Brāhmaṇa’ and ‘perishing for the sake of the Brāhmaṇa’ are two distinct
things.
