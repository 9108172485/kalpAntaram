This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika p. 548);—in *Aparārka*
(p. 1044), which adds the following notes:—‘Being the refuse of grains’
is applicable only to that liquor which is distilled from ground grains,
and not to those distilled from molasses and honey, as neither of these
two latter is ‘grain,’ which name is applicable only to *Vrīhi* and
other corns; thus then the drinking of liquor distilled from grains is
forbidden for all twice-born men, and the other two kinds for the
Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.253), firstly to the effect that ‘*Surā*’
is the name of that liquor which is distilled from grains;—secondly to
the effect that this liquor is forbidden for all ‘the three higher
castes, while that distilled from honey or molasses is forbidden for the
Brāhmaṇa only;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 89), which adds that
‘*annānām*’ stands not only for *rice*, but for barley, wheat and other
grains also,—hence it is that the wine produced by the fermentation of
grains is called ‘*Surā*—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 355), to the
effect that the name ‘*Surā*’ d irectly denotes wine made from grains
only.
