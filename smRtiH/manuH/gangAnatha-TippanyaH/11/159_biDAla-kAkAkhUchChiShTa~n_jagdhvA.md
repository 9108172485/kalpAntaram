This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 932), to the effect that on
eating the *ucchiṣṭa* of the cat and other animals one should drink the
*Brāhmīsuvarcalā* for one day;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 320), which
explains ‘*Brāhmasuvarcalā*’ as the yellow sun-flower,—the offender
should pass one day living on this;—and adds that this refers to cases
where the act is *unintentional*; where it is done intentionally, the
penance should he kept for *three* days;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p.
316).
