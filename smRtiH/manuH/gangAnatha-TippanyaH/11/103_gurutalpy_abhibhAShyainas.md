This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 1083), which adds the following
notes:—The culprit should openly proclaim his offence of having violated
his Guru’s bed;—‘*sūrmī*’ is a female image made of iron or some such
metal.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 255);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 836 and 837), which notes that there are two
expiations prescribed here:—(*a*) lying down upon a heated iron-bed, and
(*b*) embracing the red hot image;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 11
*a*);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 137), which explains ‘*gurutalpaḥ*’
(which is its reading for ‘*gurutalpī*’) as ‘*guroḥ talpam talpam
yasya*,’ ‘*sūrmī*’ as an iron image.
