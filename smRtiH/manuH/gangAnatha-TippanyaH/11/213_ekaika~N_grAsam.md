This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.320), which notes that the
quantity of food here prescribed being less than even a ‘handful’, this
must refer to cases where the person concerned is strong enough to live
upon that quantity of food;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1238), which adds that
there is to be option between ‘a morsel’ and ‘a handful’,—the one to be
adopted being dependent upon the strength of the offender and upon the
nature of the offence;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 715), which explains
‘*trīṇi tryahāṇi*’ as *nine days*.
