‘*Ekāhañcodāke vaset*’.—This is to be done, on the fourth day
(Medhātithi),—on any one of the three fasting days (Govindarāja and
Kullūka),—on the first day (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1144), which explains ‘*Māsika*’
as standing for the *Śrāddha* that is done every month during the first
year on the date of death, and *not* for the *Amāvāsyā śrāddha*;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 307), which says that this refers to the act
being *unintentional*, and adds that ‘*māsikānnam*’ refers to food given
at all after-death *śrāddhas*,—and that what is meant by ‘*ekāhamudake
vaset*’ is that ‘he should fast for three days and live on water on the
fourth day.’
