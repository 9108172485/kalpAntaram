This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 241), which
notes that this is the ‘Barley-shaped’ *Cāndrāyaṇa* as distinguished
from the ‘ant-shaped’ one described in the preceding verse. \[When the
penance begins on the first day of the brighter fortnight it is called
‘Barley-shaped’, and when begun on the first day of the bright
fortnight, it is called ‘Ant-shaped’. In verse 216, *Aparārka* and
*Madanapārijāta* read *śukle kṛṣṇe*, ma king the beginning in the
brighter fortnight\];—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 516).
