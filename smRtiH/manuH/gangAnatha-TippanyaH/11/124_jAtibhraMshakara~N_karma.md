The ‘*Jātibhraṃśakara*’ offences have been enumerated [above in verse
67].

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.254),—and again under 3.290);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 542);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 441), as
laying down the expiation common to all ‘*Jātibhraṃśakara*’
offences;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 464 and 542), which says that
when the offence is committed *intentionally*, the penance to be
performed is the *Sāntapana*, and when it is committed
*unintentionally*, it is *Prājāpatya*.
