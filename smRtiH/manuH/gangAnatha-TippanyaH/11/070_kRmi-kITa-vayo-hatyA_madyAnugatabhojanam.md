This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1129), which adds that this
refers to such ‘insects’ as have no bones;—in *Mitākṣarā* (3.242);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 924);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 30a);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 42, 238 and 465), which explains
‘*madyānugatabhojanam*’ as ‘such fruits and roots and other things as
are brought up at the time of drinking wine’,—and ‘*adhairyam*,’ as
‘being too much perturbed at even a very slight loss.’
