This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.251), according to which
‘*avijñāta garbha*’ indicates the stage of pregnancy before the sex of
the child has been determined;—it adds that though the fact of the child
in the womb belonging to the Brāhmaṇa-caste would make the offender
liable to the expiation for Brāhmaṇa-slaying,—yet, in as much as the
possibility of the child being female might lead one to think that the
guilt of killing a female would be a ‘minor sin,’ and hence involve a
lighter expiation,—it becomes necessary to emphasise the necessity of
performing the heavier expiation.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 87, 179 and 228), which adds
the explanation that, having killed the Brāhmaṇa embryo, *before its sex
has been determined*, one should perform the rites laid down in
connection with ‘Brāhmaṇa-murder,’ as also for killing a Kṣatriya or a
Vaiśya—while they are performing a sacrifice,—an d also for killing an
‘*ātreyī*,’ *i.e*., a Brāhmaṇī.
