This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.255), which remarks that this
refers to the case of a Soma-sacrificer *unintentionally* smelling the
liquor; if it is intentional, the expiation is to be doubled;—in the
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 822), which also remarks that this refers to
unintentional smelling; intentional smelling involving double the said
expiation;—in *Aparārka* (p. 1164);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta,
p. 349), as referring to the case of the smelling of the mouth of the
man who has drunk wine;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 9b).
