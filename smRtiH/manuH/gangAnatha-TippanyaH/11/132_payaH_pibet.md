“According to Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, these
penances are to be performed if the animal has been killed
unintentionally.—According to Medhātithi they have to expiate the
slaughter of a single animal.—The choice among the four penances
depends, according to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda, on the strength of the
offender, according to Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, on his caste and other
circumstances.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.270), as laying down the penances
for the killing of each of the animals severally;—in *Aparārka* (p.
1131) as referring to the killing of a cat;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
949), which explains ‘*upasparśa*’ as *bathing*, and adds that this
refers to unintentional killing; intentional killing involves double the
expiation here prescribed.
