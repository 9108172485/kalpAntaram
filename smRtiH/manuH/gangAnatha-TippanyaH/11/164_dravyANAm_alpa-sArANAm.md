This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.265), as referring to the
stealing of such things of small value as tin, lead and the like,—which
thus becomes excluded from the expiation prescribed for ‘theft’ in
general;—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 874), as referring to the stealing
of lead, tin and other things worth less than 25 *Paṇas*.
