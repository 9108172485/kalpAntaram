This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.296), to the effect that the
aforesaid offering should be made after the offenders have taken a bath
in a sacred tank;—in *Nirṇayasindhu* (pp. 402 and 409);—in *Smṛtitattva*
(p. 472);—and in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 966), which explains ‘*prāsyeyuḥ*’
as ‘should throw’.
