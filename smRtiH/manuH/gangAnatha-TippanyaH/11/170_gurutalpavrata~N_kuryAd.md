This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 544);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Prāyaścitta, p. 252), as referring to cases where the act is repeated
for one month;—and again on p. 264, where it says that it refers to
cases of repeated acts when *unintentional*, but a single act when
*intentional*;—also in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 181 and 187), which says
that this refers to cases other than those where the intercourse has
been within the forbidden circle,—it explains ‘*Svayoniṣu*’ as ‘one’s
own paternal and maternal relatives’—‘*antyajāṣu*’ as ‘Chaṇḍāla
women—and ‘*Gurutalpavratam*’ as the ‘twelve years penance.’
