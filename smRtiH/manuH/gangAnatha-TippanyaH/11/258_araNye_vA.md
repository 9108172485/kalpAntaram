This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.302), which notes that it applies
to cases of the *unintentional* slaying of the learned Brāhmaṇa, or to
those of the *intentional* repetition of the slaying of others;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 972), as referring to the *intentional once*
slaying of the learned Brāhmaṇa, or to the *unintentional repeated*
slaying of the unlearned Brāhmaṇa;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p.
456);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 32a).
