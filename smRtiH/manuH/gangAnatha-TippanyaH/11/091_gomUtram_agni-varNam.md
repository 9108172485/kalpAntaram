This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 412), which
adds that this refers to the same case as the preceding verse; *i.e*.,
to the intentional -drinking of liquor distilled from grains;—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 93), which says that the ‘milk’ and ‘clarified
butter’ meant are those of the *cow* only.
