‘*Vīra*’—‘Son’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘a
Kṣatriya’ (Nandana);—‘a deity’ (suggested by Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1154), which adds the following
notes:—The construction is ‘*māsamagnīn apavidhya*’;—‘*vīra*’ is the
sacrificer;—if the omission lasts longer than a month, the man should
perform the ‘Three monthly Goghna expiation’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* II
(p. 115);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta p. 425);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 391), which explains ‘*apavidhya*’ as
‘abandoning’,—‘*vīrahatyā*’ as ‘murdering the sacrificer’.
