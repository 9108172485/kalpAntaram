This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.224), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Bhūmideva*’ are Brāhmaṇas, the sacrificial
priests,—‘*naradeva*’ is the king of these priests, *i*. *e*., the
master of the sacrifice;—in an assembly of all these—‘*Śiṣṭvā*,’ having
proclaimed, his ‘*enaḥ*,’ guilt,—he shall take the final bath of the
*Aśvamedha* sacrifice, if permitted by the aforesaid persons, and thus
become purified.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1057), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Bhūmidevāḥ*,’ Brāhmaṇas,—‘*Naradeva*,’ the annointed
*Kṣatriya*,—at an assembly of these persons,—‘*svam enaḥ*,’ his guilt,
of Brāhmaṇ-slaying,—‘*śiṣṭvā*,’ having proclaimed,—and taking the
*avabhṛtha* bath,—he becomes purified.
