This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva*, (p. 556);—in *Aparārka* (p.
1075);—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 37), as laying down in what respects the
expiatory sacrament differs from the ordinary initiatory sacrament;—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 104), which says that all this refers to things
that had come into contact with wine sometime in the past;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla p. 325).
