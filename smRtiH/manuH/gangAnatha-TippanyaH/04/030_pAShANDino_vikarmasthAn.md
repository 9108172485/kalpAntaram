‘*Pāṣaṇḍinaḥ*’—‘Ascetics who wander about with external marks, such as
nakedness, red-dresses, and so forth’ (Medhātithi, who does not explain
the term as ‘non-brahmanical ascetics,’ as asserted by Buhler,—and also
Govindarāja);—‘Śākyas, Bhikṣus, Kṣapaṇakas and other ascetics outside
the Vedic pale’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘those who do not believe in the
Vedas’ (Rāghavānanda). The ‘*vāhyaliṅgin*’ does not mean, as Hopkins
says, ‘those who bear the token of outcastes’; what is really meant is
the person who, without possessing any real asceticism of the heart,
*makes a show of it, by wearing external marks*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 170), which explains
‘*vikarmasthān*’ as ‘those addicted to such acts as are forbidden—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on l. 130), which explains ‘*haituka*’ as ‘one who, by
argumentation, raises doubts about everything’, — ‘*pāṣaṇḍinaḥ*’ as
‘those-who have recourse to such life-conditions as are opposed to the
dictates of the Vedas—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 319).
