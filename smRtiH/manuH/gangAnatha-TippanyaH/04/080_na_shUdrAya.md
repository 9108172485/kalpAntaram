“Discrepancies between this verse and others in the work (9.125) are
explained by the commentators, who say that the Śūdra mentioned in the
other rules is the family servant.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 220), which explains ‘*vratam*’
as ‘*prāyascittam*’, ‘expiatory rite’;—and again on p. 1090, where it is
pointed out that the giving of advice regarding ‘expiation’, that is
forbidden here, refers to those cases where the Śūdra seeks advice
without the mediation of a Brāhmaṇa.

It is quoted also in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.262), which remarks that the
prohibition refers to those cases where the Śūdra does not seek advice
in a meek and suppliant attitude;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
71b);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72), which says that what is
forbidden here is ‘*direct* teaching.’
