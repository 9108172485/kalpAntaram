This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.151);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 535), which explains ‘*prauḍhapādaḥ*’ as ‘with feet placed
on a seat or over his thighs,’—‘*avasakthikā*’ as ‘tying up the knees
with the loin,’—and the second line as ‘indicating the time during which
hands may be wet after washing and rinsing the mouth, or having taken
the food specified’;—in *Nirṇayasindhu*, (p. 194), which explains
‘*prauḍhapāda*’ as ‘placing one foot over another,’ or ‘with feet placed
on the seat’, the latter explanation being attributed to Haradatta;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati*, (Kāla, p. 195);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 779), which
explains ‘*avasakthikā*’ as ‘tying the knees together with a napkin’;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56), which explains ‘*prauḍhapāda*’ as ‘spreading
the feet’, or ‘putting one foot over the other,’ and ‘*avasakthikā*’ as
‘tying the knees together with a piece of cloth;’—in *Smṛticandrikā*,
(Saṃskāra, p. 162), which explains ‘*prauḍhapāda*’ as ‘with a foot

with the waist by a piece of cloth or some such thing’;—in

‘*avasakthikā*’;— and in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 235), which explains
