This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 217), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Nitya*’ here stands for all that is done without any desire for
personal gain’;—‘*paramā gatiḥ*’ means ‘deliverance’;—what is meant is
that what leads to Deliverance is the performance of duty along with the
true knowledge of the Supreme Self.

The verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 52),—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 48).
