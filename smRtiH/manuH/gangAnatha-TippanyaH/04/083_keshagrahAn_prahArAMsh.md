‘*Tailena*’—This, is construed by almost all the commentators with
‘*spṛśet*’, ‘one should not touch with oil any *limb* after having
bathed his head’; by others with ‘*Śiraḥsnātaḥ*’, ‘one who has anointed
his head *with oil* shall noṭ touch any limb’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183), which construes the second
line to mean ‘having anointed his head with oil, he shall not rub that
same oil over any other limb, or he shall not, during the rest of that
day, rub his body with any oil at all’.
