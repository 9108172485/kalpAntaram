This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 170), which remarks that in
connection with all these ‘*vratas*’, it has to be borne in mind that
what is exactly meant by the term ‘*vrata*’ is the *mental
determination* that ‘I shall do this—I shall not do that’,—and that all
these have to be taken up immediately after the Final Bath.
