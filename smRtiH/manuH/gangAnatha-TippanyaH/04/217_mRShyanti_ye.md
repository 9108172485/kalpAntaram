This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.190) in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
945);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 496), which adds that one
should not eat the food of a person who brooks the presence of a
paramour in his house, as also of one who, *in all things* (*sarvaśaḥ*)
is under the sway of women,—‘*anirdaśam pretānnam*’ is that food which
has been offered to the dead within ten days of the
death,—‘*atuṣṭikaram*’ is that food the taste of which is not
agreeable;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 774);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 261).
