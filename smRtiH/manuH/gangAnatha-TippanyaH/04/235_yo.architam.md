This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 290);—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p.
894), which adds the followings—where the giver gives with respect, and
the receiver receives it with respect,—both go to heaven; while by
giving or receiving with disrespect, both go to hell’—such is the
explanation given by Kullūka Bhaṭṭa. Thus the ‘*arcā*’, ‘respect’, which
appears as an adverb, serves as an adjective also, qualifying the men
concerned; it is for this reason that *Maithila* writers have declared
that gifts should be made after the object to be given as well as the
Brāhmaṇa receiving it have both been worshipped;—and in
*Dānakriyākaumudī* (p. 8).
