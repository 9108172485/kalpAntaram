This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 34), which explains the meaning
to be that ‘one should cover the ground either with sticks, or with
clods, or with leaves, or with grass and then ease
himself,’—‘*saṃvītāṅgaḥ*’ means ‘with body wrapped’, and
‘*avaguṇṭhitaḥ*’, ‘with head covered’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p.
25), which explains ‘*vācam niyamya*’ as ‘silent’,—‘*saṃvītaṅgaḥ*’ as
‘with the sacred thread hanging by the neck over the back’;—it notes
that Kullūka and others explain the word as ‘with body wrapped’,—and
‘*avaguṇṭhitaḥ*’ as ‘with head covered’;—in *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 57);—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 3a);—and in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 45),
which explains ‘*uccāra*’ as ‘stools’,—‘*samutsarga*’ as ‘evacuation’.
