*Medhātithi* (P. 356, l. 20)—‘*Vaiśvānaranyāyaḥ*’—This refers to
*Mīmāṃsā-sūtra*, 4.38 *et. seq*, where it is stated that though the
*Vaiśvānara* sacrifice is performed by the Father, yet its results
accrue to the Son.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68)—which adds
‘*Kṛtodharmaḥ*’ should be construed as ‘*Kṛtaḥ adharma*’, as the context
deals with *Adharma*,—‘*na* *niṣphalaḥ*,’ *i.e*., unless it is expiated.
