This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524), as setting
forth an epitome of what one’s ‘duty’ is;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (I., p.
695),—and again in II, p. 204, in connection with *tilaka* marks on the
forehead;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 275) to the effect that even when
living in foreign lands one should keep up the ways of his fathers;—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 1680);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 68), which says
that this refers to cases of optional alternatives only;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71a);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 9) to the effect that family-custom is to be regarded as a guide in
cases where there is a difference of opinion among the various
scriptural texts.
