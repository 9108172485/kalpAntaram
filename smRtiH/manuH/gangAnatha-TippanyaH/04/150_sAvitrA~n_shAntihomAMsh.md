This verse is quoted in Apar ā rka (p. 229), where it is explained to
mean that ‘one should offer on the fifteenth day of every fortnight the
*Ājya-homas* to Savitṛ, which alleviate the evil effects of sins;—and in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 682), which explains ‘*Savitrai*’ as ‘those
dedicated to the deity Savitṛ.’
