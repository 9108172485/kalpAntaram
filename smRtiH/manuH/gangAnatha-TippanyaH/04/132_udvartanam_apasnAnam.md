‘*Apasnānam*’—‘Water that has been used already’ (Medhātithi);—‘water
used for washing a corpse’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse has been quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 576), which explains ‘*apasnānam*’ as ‘water that drops
from the body when one is bathing,’—‘*niṣṭhyūtam*’ as ‘spittings’;—and
in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 321).
