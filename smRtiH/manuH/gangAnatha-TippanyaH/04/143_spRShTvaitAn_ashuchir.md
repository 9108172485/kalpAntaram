This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p, 231), which explains that the
term *prāṇa* here indicates the holes in the head, which form the loci
of the ‘breaths’,—the term ‘*gātra*’ indicates the chest, the head and
the shoulders, the touching whereof has been described as
purificatory;—and adds that the ‘touching’ here laid down is for the
purposes of purification.

It is also quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.155) as laying down the
purificatory act to be done after water-sipping;—and in
*Nityācāropaddhati* (p. 36), as laying down the expiation for looking by
chance at the things mentioned.
