‘*Gauḥ*’—Buhler is again unfair to Medhātithi. Both Medhātithi and
Kullūka take this term ‘*gauḥ*’ precisely as Buhler says ‘it is not
impossible’. (See *Translation*.) From what Buhler says, Govindarāja,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take ‘*gauḥ*’ only as ‘the *Cow*, which at once
yields its benefits by its milk &c.’ This verse is quoted in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68), which says that, if the ‘*gauḥ*’ is
taken as an example *per* similarity, then it means ‘earth’,—the earth
does not produce the harvest immediately after sowing of seeds; if it is
taken as ‘cow’, then it is an example *per* dissimilarity, the meaning
being ‘the cow gives its products, in the shape of milk &c. immediately,
not so *sin*, which takes time to fructify.’
