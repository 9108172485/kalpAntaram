This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 179);—in *Vīramitrodaya*,
(Āhnika, p. 33), which explains ‘*cityām*’ as the *Śyena* and other
altars built of bricks, or ‘at a place where a dead body has been
cremated’ (according to some); and in connection with ‘dilapidated
temples’ it remarks that, inasmuch as the making of water in *all kinds*
of temples is expressly forbidden, the addition of the epithet
‘dilapidated’, ‘*jīrṇa*’, must be understood to have been added with a
view to the perceptible physical danger involved in the act,—*i*. *e*.,
of loose bricks and other things falling and the like;—‘*Valmīka*’ is
‘the mound of mud collected by a particular kind of insect’

This verse is quoted also in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 329);—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 153);—and in *Nityācārapradīpa*, (p. 250),
which explains ‘*cityām*’ as ‘On a fire-altar.’
