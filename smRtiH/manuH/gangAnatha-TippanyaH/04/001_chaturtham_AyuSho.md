This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 562), which adds
that the rule here laid down is on the basis of the understanding that
the ordinary span of man’s life is a hundred years;—and in
*Saṃskāramayūkha*, (p. 64), which remarks that the span of man’s life
being a hundred years, one should devote twenty-five years to each of
the four life—stages,—such is the view of the writers of the Digests.
