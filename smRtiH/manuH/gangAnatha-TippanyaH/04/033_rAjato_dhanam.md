title = "033 राजतो धनम्"

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 33), which adds that where
the text says ‘not from others’, what it means is that ‘in the event of
those named here being available, one should not seek for it from
others’;—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 402), which explains ‘*rājan*’
as standing for ‘the just king of the Kṣatriya caste’.
