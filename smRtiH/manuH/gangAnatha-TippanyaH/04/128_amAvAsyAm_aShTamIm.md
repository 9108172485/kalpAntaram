This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.79);—in *Aparārka* (p. 103),
which adds that on the ground of the terms ‘*Aṣṭami*’ and ‘*Caturdaśī*’
occurring along with ‘*Amāvasyā*’, it is understood that they stand for
the eighth and fourteenth days of the *Fortnight*,—not of the
‘season’;—and that the particle ‘*api*’ indicates that intercourse on
the dates mentioned is to be avoided, also when they happen to fall
outside the ‘season’;—and in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 724), which adds that
‘*Aṣṭamī*’ and ‘*Caturdaśī* mentioned as they are along with
‘*Amāvasyā*,’ must stand for the eighth and fourteenth days *of the
fortnight*, not those of the wife’s ‘period.’

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 346);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra,
p. 498), which adds that the passage is to be construed as
‘*strīsaṅgatyāgena brahmacārī bhavet*’; ‘on the dates of the month
specified, one should behave like the Student by avoiding intercourse
with his wife’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (pp. 286 and 368), as forbidding
sexual intercourse on ‘*parva*’ days, and adds that ‘*snātakaḥ*’ here
stands for the *House-holder*;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 683);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 38);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
155), which adds that the particle ‘*ca*’ is meant to include the
*Saṅkrānti* day,—and explains the term ‘*snātaka*’ to mean ‘one whose
wife has bathed for her season.’
