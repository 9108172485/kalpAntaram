This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 224), which explains ‘*Karma*’ as
‘*Dharma*’;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 524);—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 14), which adds that the ‘act’ here mentioned must be such as is not
incompatible with the teachings of scriptures; though even in regard to
such acts, there are exceptions; *e.g*., even though an act may have
been enjoined by the scriptures, it should not be done if it is against
popular opinion;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 71b).
