This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 193), which adds that this refers
to that ‘Vedic study’ which forms part of the daily ‘*Brahmayajña*’,
being based, as it is, on the following Taittirīya text: ‘*Tasya vā
etasya yajñasya dvāvanadhyāyau yadātmā*’ *śuciryoddeśaḥ*,’—which bears
specially upon the *Brahmayajña*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 775), which
says that this refers to that Vedic study which forms part of the daily
*Brahmayajña*;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 164), which has the same
note;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 196).
