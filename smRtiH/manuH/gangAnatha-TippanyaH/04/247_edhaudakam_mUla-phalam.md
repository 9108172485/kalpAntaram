This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 406), which explains
‘*abhayadaksiṇā*’ as ‘*abhayadāna*’, ‘gift of fearlessness’;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 1.214);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 190);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 220), which adds the following
explanations:—‘*edha*’ is ‘fuel’,—‘*sarvataḥ*’ means ‘even from the
Śūdra’,—the ‘gift of fearlessness’ being acceptable even from a
*Mleccha*; all this refers to one who is still engaged in the receiving
of gifts, not to one who has renounced the acceptance of gifts;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 249), which adds—‘*sarvataḥ*’ means ‘even from
the Śūdra the ‘gift of fearlessness’ being acceptable from the Mleccha
also;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, pp. 35b and 37b);—and in *Hemādri*
(Dāna, p. 56), which explains ‘*edhaḥ*’ as *wood* and ‘*ahhyudyatam*’ as
‘presented unasked.’
