‘*Vivāde-kalahe*’—‘Verbal altercation—actual fight’ (Medhātithi and
Kullūka);—‘dispute on legal matters—altercation’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 535);—in
*Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 194);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 162), which
explains ‘*bhuktamātre*’ as ‘so long as one’s hands are wet’;—in
*Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 773), which has the same explanation;—in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 772),—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56),
which explains ‘*muktake*’ (which is its reading for ‘*śuktake*’, or
‘*sūtake*’) as ‘*mukhodgāre*’, ‘where there is eructation, or belching.’
