This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 476), which explains
‘*uddhṛtasneham*’ as refering to ‘*piṇyāka*’ (residue of seeds ground
for oil) and things of that kind; and ‘*atiprage*’, as ‘before the sun
long risen’;—the third quarter is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 290);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 30), as precluding the time of sunset and sunrise, and
explains

‘*Sauhitya*’ as ‘over-satisfaction ‘satiation’;—and in *Saṃskāramyūkha*
(p. 71), which remarks that by this the eating of ‘*takra*’ becomes
wrong; as there is nothing to justify an exception in favour of *takra*;
it explains ‘*Sauhitya*’ as ‘over-eating’.
