‘*Vahirmālyam*’—‘Garland over the dress’ (Medhātithi);—‘garland over the
head’ (Kullūka);—‘garland on public roads and such uncovered places’
(‘others’ in Medhātithi);—or ‘garland without scent’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72), which adds that going
on carts drawn by bullocks is only *slightly* reprehensible (not
*sarvathā*, wholly, reprehensible, as riding on their back is).
