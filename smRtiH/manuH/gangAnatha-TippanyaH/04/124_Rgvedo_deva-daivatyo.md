This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 534), which adds
that according to a declaration by Āpastamba, the time, during which the
Ṛk and other Vedas are recited, is unfit for the chanting of the
Sāman;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 160), as stating the reason for
what has been declared in the preceding verse;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi*
(p. 443);—and in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 768),—in all these to the same
effect.
