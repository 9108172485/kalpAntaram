This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 169), which adds the
following notes:—In view of the term ‘*Nipānakartuḥ*’ in the second
line, the term ‘*Parakīya*’ should be taken to mean ‘made by another
person’; as *Kalpataru* holds that ‘*Parakīya*’ must mean ‘made by
another’,—whether consecrated or unconsecrated, since no distinction
between them is made anywhere;—\[This appears to be a gist of
Medhātithi’s explanation of ‘*Parakīya*,’ for which see *Translation*
\];—‘*Nipāna*’ means ‘water-reservoir.’

This verse is quoted also in *Kālaviveka* (p. 328), which too makes the
same observations as *Vīramitrodaya* (just quoted).

It is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 234), which makes the remark that
the tank that has been consecrated and made over to the public cannot be
called ‘*parakīya*’; and this favours Medhātithi’s interpretation of the
verse, which is supported also by what follows in the next verse;—in
*Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 65), which explains ‘*parakīya*’ as ‘dug by another,’
and says it cannot mean ‘belonging to another’; as is quite clear from
what is added regarding the *nipānakartṛ*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
874);—in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 300), which explains ‘*parakīya*’ as
‘dug by others’;—and is *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 324), which says that
‘*Kadācana*’ makes it clear that the prohibition is absolute.
