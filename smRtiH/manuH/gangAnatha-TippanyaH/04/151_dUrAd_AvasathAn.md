‘*Niṣekam*’—‘Bath-water’ (Medhātithi);—‘Seminal discharge’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 211);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 23), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Niṣeka*’ according to *Kalpataru*, means ‘the throwing away of
used up unclean things’ and ‘*Ucchiṣtānna*’ means ‘the throwing of the
leavings of food’; while Kullūka Bhaṭṭa explains ‘*Niṣeka*’ as ‘seminal
discharge’.
