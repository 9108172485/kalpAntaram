This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 187) to the effect that after
*Upākarma* and *Utsarjana*, one should observe a holiday of either one
day or three days;—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.143);—in *Smṛtichandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 154), which says that this verse, along with verse 119,
lays down three alternatives—(1) ‘*Pakṣiṇī rātri*’, *i.e*., one night
with a day preceding, and another following it,—(2) three days
(mentioned in verse 119) and (3) one day—the alternative to be adopted
being determined by one’s own *Gṛhyasūtra*;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 761),
which adds the same note;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 58).
