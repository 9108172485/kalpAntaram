‘*Dhāvena*’—‘Disposition’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda);—‘motive’ (suggested by Medhātithi,and also Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 17), which, explains
‘*bhāva*’ as standing for the predominance of one or other of the three
*guṇas*, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
