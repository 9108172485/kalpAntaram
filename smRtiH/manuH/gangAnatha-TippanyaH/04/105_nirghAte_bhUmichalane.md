‘*Jyotiṣāñcopasarjane*’—‘When there is a halo round the planets, and
when they strike each other’ (Medhātithi);—‘when there is an eclipse’
(Nārāyaṇa, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 188), which explains ‘*ṛtau*’ as
‘during the raniny season’, and ‘*ākālikān*’ as ‘during the time of the
phenomenon’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 530), which explains
‘*Nirghāta*’ as ‘sound in the sky’, and ‘*Jyotiṣāmupasarjanam*’ as ‘halo
round the sun or the moon’, or ‘the falling of meteors’;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 151) which explains ‘*Nirghāta*’ as ‘a
peculiar sound in the sky’, and ‘*Jyotiṣāmupasarjanam*’ as ‘the
appearance of a halo round the Sun or the Moon’;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 194).
