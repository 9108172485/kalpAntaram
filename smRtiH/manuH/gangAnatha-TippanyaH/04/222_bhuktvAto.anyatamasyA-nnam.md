This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 240), which adds that the term
‘*kṛcchra*’ here stands for the ‘*atikṛcchra*,’ on the strength of a
text quoted from Śaṅkha;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 300),
which adds that what is prescribed in the first half is to be done only
in the event of the man being unable to throw out the food eaten; and
again on p. 305;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 542);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(pp. 252, 261 and 524).
