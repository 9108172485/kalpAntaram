‘*Bālātapaḥ*’—The morning sun’ (Medhātithi);—‘the Sun in the sign of
Virgo, *i.e*., the autumnal Sun’ (Rāghavānanda).

‘*Na chindyānnakharomāni*’—‘He should not clip his nails or
hair,’—‘himself, *i.e*., he should employ a barber’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja),—‘before they have grown long’ (Kullūka),—‘except at the
proper time for dipping’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 71), which explains ‘*Bālātapa*’ as the ‘autumnal Sun’ \[‘*Bāla*’
standing for the zodiacal sign of *Kanyā*, Virgo, and it is during the
month of *Kārtika* that the *Sun* (*ātapa*) is in that sign\].
