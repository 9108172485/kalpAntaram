The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290).

The verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451), which explains
‘*ghuṣṭānnam*’ as ‘the food that is offered at sacrificial sessions and
other similar occasions, to all and sundry by public proclamation’;—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 495), which explains ‘*ghuṣṭānna*’ in the
same manner as *Smṛtitattva*, but quotes Medhātithi’s second alternative
explanation of it as ‘what had been previously promised to another
person’; ‘*viśeṣataḥ*’ has been added with a view to indicate the
exceptional objectionability of the food;—‘*gaṇa*’ is ‘multitude,’—this
term is not applicable to brothers who have not separated;—‘*gaṇikā*’ is
a ‘prostitute’;—‘what has been condemned by a disinterested person
learned in the Veda, even without his detecting any of the specified
defects.’

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 510 and 771);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which adds the following notes:
—‘*Ghuṣṭānnam*’, that food which is offered publicly with such words as
‘who is there who will take this food?’,—‘*gaṇānnam*’ food cooked by
several persons jointly.
