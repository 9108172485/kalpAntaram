This verse, which is 52 in Buhler, Burnell and Kullūka and other
commentators, is 49 according to Medhātithi, who remarks that ‘some
people do not read this verse in the present Discourse’. It is
interesting, in the light of this remark, to note that this verse is not
quoted in any of the important Nibandhas.

This verse is quoted in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 248), which explains
‘*saṃvītāṅgaḥ*’ as ‘with the sacred thread hanging by the neck.’
