This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 534), which
explains ‘*Dharmanaipuṇyakāmāḥ*’ as ‘those who have not yet got up the
Veda adding that for those who have already got up the Veda, there would
be nothing wrong in reading it in the village’;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
771), which has the following notes:—Those who have completed their
studies and carry it on further only for the sake of acquiring spiritual
merit are here spoken of as ‘*Dharmanaipuṇyakāma*’, those still engaged
in elementary studies are called ‘*vidyānaipuṇyakāma*’; it is for the
former that reading in villages and towns is here prohibited;—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 161), which has the same note and adds
that the implication is that for those who are ‘*vidyānaipuṇyakāma*,’
reading in villages and towns is not forbidden;—and in
*Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 194), which notes that the holidays laid
down for the ‘*dharmanaipuṇayakāma*’ are not meant for others.
