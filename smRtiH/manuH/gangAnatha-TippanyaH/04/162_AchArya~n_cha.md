‘*Hiṃsyāt*’—‘Strike, or talk in an offensive manner, or act against’
(Medhātithi);—‘act against’ (Kullūka);—‘injure’ (Govindarāja).

‘*Tapasvinaḥ*’—‘All persons engaged in austerities, including those
engaged in expiatory penances’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘ascetics’
(Nandana and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 223);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.21),
in the sense that no injury should be inflicted upon the persons
mentioned, even though they attack one with murderous intent;—in
*Vyāvahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 118);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyāvahāra, p.
7a), which explains the meaning to be that the persons mentioned should
not be killed, even if they turn out to be ‘*ātatāyin*’, ‘dangerous
criminal’.
