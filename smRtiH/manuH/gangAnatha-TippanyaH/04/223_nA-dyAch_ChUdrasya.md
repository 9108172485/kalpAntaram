This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 341), which explains
‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘one who does not offer the daily Śrāddhas’; and adds
that this is meant to indicate the compulsory character of these
Śrāddhas,—and ‘*ekarātrikam*’ is explained as ‘what is enough for one
day.”

Buhler notes that Nārāyaṇa explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as ‘destitute of
faith’. But the reading thus explained must be ‘*aśraddhinaḥ*’ which is
a var: lec: noted by Medhātithi.

The verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 490) which adds that
the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ here must be taken as standing for the *Pākayajña*,
which is prescribed for the *Śūdra*;—he who performs that is called
‘*Śrāddhin*’;—if a Śūdra does not perform it, his ‘cooked food’ should
not be eaten;—such is the explanation given by Medhātithi. *Kalpataru*
on the other hand, has explained the term ‘*Śrāddha*’ as standing for
the *daily Śrāddhas*. In some places the word is read as
‘*Aśraddhinaḥ*’, which means ‘devoid of faith’.—In the event of
‘abnormal distress’—‘*avṛttau*’—one should receive from him uncooked—not
cooked—rice or other grain, just enough to last for one day.

It is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 250);—in *Prāyascittaviveka*
(p. 253), which explains ‘*aśrāddhinaḥ*’ as the Śūdra ‘who is not
entitled to partake of Śrāddha food’;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p.
785);—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 320).
