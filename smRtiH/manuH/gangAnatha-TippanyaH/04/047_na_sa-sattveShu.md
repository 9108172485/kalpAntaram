This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 179), which adds that, the
‘*parvata*’ having been already mentioned in the preceding verse, the
‘top of the mountain’ is mentioned here with a view to indicate that if,
under certain circumstances, it cannot be avoided, one may pass urine on
a mountain elsewhere than on the ‘top’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika,
p. 33), which quotes only the first foot, and explains ‘*sasattveṣu*’ as
‘with living creatures’; the second foot being quoted on p. 37, where
‘*sthitaḥ*’ is explained as ‘standing’.
