This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 180);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.135),
in the sense that looking at the Sun is forbidden only at stated times,
not always, as seems to be implied by Yājñavalkya’s words;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 494), which explains ‘*uparaktam*’ (*v.
l*. ‘*upasṛṣṭam*’) as ‘eclipsed’;—again on p. 578, as mentioning things
that should not be looked at;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 162), which adds that
the prohibition of looking at the eclipsed sun is not applicable to that
seeing of the eclipse which has been clearly enjoined as conducive to
great merit;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 476);—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi*
(p. 346);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 388) as prohibiting the house-holder
seeing the eclipsed sun;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (p. 124), which explains ‘*upasṛṣṭam*’ as ‘eclipsed’;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 292);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 320);—in
*Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 94), which says that ‘*īkṣaṇa*’ cannot be taken
as standing for mere *knowing* (as some people have held), and that it
does not prohibit the first *seeing* of the eclipse, which is necessary
to entitle the man to bathe; what is forbidden is only the unnecessary
*repeated* seeing of the eclipse;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 218).
