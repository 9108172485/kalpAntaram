‘*Nigamas*’—According to Medhātithi, the term *Nigamas* does not mean
the *Aṅgas*, as stated by Buhler,—but it includes
Nigama—Nirukta—Vyākaraṇa—Mīmāṃsā;—Kullūka explains the term as ‘works,
called *Nigama*, explanatory of the meaning of the Veda’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 127), which explains ‘*Nigamān*’
as ‘the Nighaṇṭu and other works that help in ascertaining the meanings
of words’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 509) as laying down what
should be studied;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 155), which explains
‘*buddhivṛddhikarāṇi*’ as ‘Tarka, Mīmāṃsā and the rest,’—*dhanyāni*’ as
‘the *Arthaśāstras*, which are conducive to the acquisition of
wealth,’—‘*hitāni*’ as ‘the Ayurveda and so forth,’—and ‘*nigamāḥ*’ as
‘the Nighaṇṭu and other works that help in the understanding of the
meanings of words’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 71);—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(p. 132).
