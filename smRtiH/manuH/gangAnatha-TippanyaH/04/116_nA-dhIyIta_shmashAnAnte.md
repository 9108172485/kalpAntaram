This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 534), which
explains the third quarter to mean that ‘one should not read the Veda
when wearing the cloth that he had worn at the time of sexual
intercourse’; and adds that this refers to cases where the cloth has not
been washed after the act;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 770), which explains
‘*ante*’ as ‘near’ and ‘*maithunam vāsaḥ*’ as ‘the cloth, clad in which
he has had sexual intercourse’; he should not wear this—without its
being washed—while reading;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 56);—in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 160), which reproduces the same remarks as
those in *Hemādri*;—and in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p. 195).
