‘*Kusūladhānyakaḥ*’—Having as much grain as is contained in a *Kusūla*,
a granary, *i*. *e*., enough to feed the household for *one year*’ (not
*three* as mentioned by Buhler) \[Medhātithi\];—‘enough to last twelve
days’ (Govindarāja);—‘enough for three years’ (Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘enough for twelve, six or three months’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Kumbhīdhānyakaḥ*’—‘Having as much grain as may be contained in a
*Kumbhī*, *i.e*., enough to last for six months’ (Medhātithi);—‘enough
to last for six days’ (Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa);—‘enough for one year’
(Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 169);—in *Mitākṣarā*, (on
1.128), which adds that this refers, not to all Brāhmaṇas, but to those
only who are ‘*yāyāvara*’ *i.e*., ‘who devote themselves entirely to
study, sacrifice and making gifts, and do not have recourse to teaching,
sacrificing for others and receiving gifts, or amassing of wealth’
(according to Devala);—also on 3.29, as describing the four kinds of
‘Householder’;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 216);—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II,
p. 246), which explains ‘*Kusūla*’ as ‘*Koṣṭhakam*,’—‘*Kumbhī*’ as
‘*aṣṭrikā*,’ and the whole compound as ‘one who possesses grain enough
to fill the one or the other’;—‘*tryahika*’ as ‘one who has grains
enough *to last for* three days,’ and ‘*aśvastana*’ as ‘one not having
grains for the morrow’;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 37a).
