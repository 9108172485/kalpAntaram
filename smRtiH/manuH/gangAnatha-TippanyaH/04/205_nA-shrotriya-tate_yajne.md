This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
944);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 494), which explains
‘*aśrotriyatate*’ as ‘that which is performed by such priests or
sacrifices as are devoid of Vedic learning’; this prohibition must mean
that one should not eat at such a sacrifice, even *after
Agniṣomīya-Vapāyāga*; as regards the time before this, eating at a
sacrifice is already forbidden by the general rule that ‘one should not
eat the food belonging to one who has been initiated for a sacrificial
performance’;—‘*grāmayājin*’ is one who performs sacrifices for groups
of men; and one should not eat at a sacrifice where such a priest makes
the offerings;—nor should one eat at a house where *Vaiśvadeva* and
other offerings have been made by a woman; this must be taken as
applying to cases where such priests are available, for where they are
not available, even women fire permitted to make the
offerings;—‘*klība*’ is ‘impotent’.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 770);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*
(p. 259), which adds the following notes—‘*aśrotrīya*’, one who has not
learnt the Veda,—‘*grāmayājī*’, one who officiates as priest at the
Śrāddha and other performances by several persons, or performs
propitiatory rites for others; one should not go to a sacrifice where
such a man happens to be the *Hotṛ*, priest.
