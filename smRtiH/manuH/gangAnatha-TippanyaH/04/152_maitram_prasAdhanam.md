This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika), on page 31, where it
is noted that all this to be done in the forenoon is meant for persons
not otherwise engaged;—that the term ‘*Pūrvāhṇa*’, ‘forenoon’, really
stands for ‘early morning’, since ‘the evacuation of the bowels’, and
‘cleaning of the teeth’ have been laid down as to be done in the early
mornings—Hence the term ‘forenoon’ should be taken to stand for such
parts of the forenoon as have been specifically prescribed for each of
the acts; thus it follows that the ‘evacuation of the bowels’, ‘cleaning
of the teeth’ and ‘morning-bath’ cannot be done-after sun-rise in regard
to the ‘worshipping of gods’, the term ‘forenoon’ should be understood
as standing for the first eighth part of the day.—The verse is quoted
again on page 148;—and in *Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 290).
