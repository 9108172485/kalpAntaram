‘*Nṛśaṃsa*’—‘cruel person’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘a
bard’ (Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, also suggested by Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.290);—in *Madanapārijāta* (p.
945),—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 496), which adds the
following—‘*Śvavān*’ is one who keeps dogs for
hunting-purposes,—‘*Śauṇḍika*’ is the liquor-seller,—‘*Celanirṇejaka*’
is one who lives by washing clothes,—‘*rajaka*’ is the
cloth-dyer,—‘*nṛśaṃsa*’ is one devoid of pity—and the man in whose house
a recognised paramour lives;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 774);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 251), which explains ‘*Śvavān*’ as ‘one who
keeps dogs for hunting purposes’ and remarks that ‘*Śauṇḍika*’ and the
other terms stand for the twice-born person who follows these
professions.
