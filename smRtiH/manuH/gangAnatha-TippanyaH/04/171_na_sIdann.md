This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 68), which adds
the following explanation:—‘*Sīdan*’, even though one may be in
difficulties regarding necessary expenses,—‘*adharmeṇa*’, by improper
appropriation of what belongs to others,—‘*adharmikāṇām*’, of those who
do not perform the prescribed duties,—‘*pāpānām*,’ of those who do what
is forbidden,—‘*viparyayam*,’ loss of wealth and other things,—‘*āśu*’
lias been added only with a view to emphasise, as calamity is actually
found to overtake sinners *after the lapse of some time also*.
