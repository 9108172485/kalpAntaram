This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 529), which
explains it as—‘From the time of the phenomenon to the same time next
day, it is unfit for study in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 834), which also gives
the same explanation of ‘*ākālikam*’;—in *Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi* (p. 443),
which explains ‘*eteṣu*’ as referring to ‘*vidyut*’ and the rest, and
notes that ‘*ākālikam*’ goes with each of them;—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p.
761), which has the same note and explains ‘*ākālikam*’ as beginning
from the time of the phenomenon and extending up to the same time of the
next day;—and adds that in seasons other than the rains, the ‘holiday’
is to be observed in the evening;—in *Gadādharapaddhati* (Kāla, p.
194);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*, (p. 57), which adds the following notes:—all
the three phenomena are to be taken collectively here, on account of the
copulative compound—says Medhātithi; according to Hemādri, each is to be
taken separately; what is said here refers to the rainy season;
‘*ākālikam*’ means ‘from the time of the occurrence to the same time on
the morrow’; ‘Lightning and the rest’ are to be treated as ‘occasions of
holiday’ only when they occur either in the morning or in the
evening;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 149), which takes each of
the three phenomena separately, and has the same notes as above.
