Burnell is not right in saying that “Medhātithi omits this verse” (see
*Translation*). He adds—“The verse occurs in the Mahābhārata 13.104.76,
following the one that is equivalent to Manu 52, but with the var. lec.
(a) *ubhe mūtrapurīṣe tu* (b) (in the second *pāda*) *tathāhyāyurna
ṛsyate*.”

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 27), which explains
‘*yathādivā*’ as ‘facing the North’;—and again on p. 30;—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 328), which explains ‘*uccāra*’ as ‘excreta’;—in
*Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 152);—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 265), which notes
that the freedom herein set forth is meant only for occasions when one
is unable to determine the exact directions, and when there is danger to
life;—in *Kṛtyasārasamuccaya* (p. 45), which explains
‘*prāṇabādhābhayeṣu*’ as ‘when there is danger to life from tigers and
other things’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 3b);—and in
*Nityācārapradīpa* (p. 250).
