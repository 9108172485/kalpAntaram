The first half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3. 290);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 944);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 494),
which explains ‘*mattaḥ*’ as ‘intoxicated, either by wine or by wealth
etc.’—and ‘*āturaḥ*’ as ‘afflicted with a very serious disease.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 451), which explains
‘*Keśakītāvapanna*’ as ‘defiled by the presence of hair or insects’;—and
‘*Kāmataḥ*’ as ‘intentionally’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 517),
which adds that since the text has added the qualification ‘*Kāmataḥ*’,
there should be no harm if the food happens to be touched by the foot
*unintentionally*;—in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, pp. 610 and 770);—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 296);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 260), which
explains ‘*Keśakītāvapannam*’ as ‘cooked along with hairs or insects’.
