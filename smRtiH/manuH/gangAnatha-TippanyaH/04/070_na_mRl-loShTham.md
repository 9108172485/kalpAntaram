This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 183), which explains ‘*āyati*’ as
‘*pariṇāma*’, ‘result’—‘*Karma*’ as *Saṅkalpa* ‘volition’,
‘determination’; and this is ‘fruitless,’ ‘*niṣphala*’, when it turns
out to be *false*, *i.e*., when the determination is not carried into
practice; as regards the crushing of clods etc., what is to be avoided
is the *habit* of doing it;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 72).
