According to Medhātithi this verse permits the king to admit the
authority of only such local and family customs and practices as are
*not contrary to Śruti and Smṛti*,—Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda,
however, take it to mean that he is to accept as authority only such
scriptural rules of conduct *as are not contrary to local and family
customs*,—According to ‘others’ (mentioned by Medhātithi) what, the
verse means is that ‘whatever virtuous practices the king finds being
followed in one country, those he shall introduce in other countries
also, if they are not contrary to scriptural texts.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 25), which says
that family and country customs are to be regarded as right, but only
when they are not repugnant to *Śruti* and other authoritative sources
of knowledge.
