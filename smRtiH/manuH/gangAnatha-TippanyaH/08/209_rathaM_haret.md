This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 120), which adds the
following notes:—For the followers of certain recensions it is laid down
in connection with the fire-kindling rites that the Adhvaryu is to
receive the chariot the Brāhmaṇa priest a swift horse, the Udgātṛ
priest, the cart in which the Soma is carried.—‘*Kraye*’ means at the
purchase of Soma.—Hence the answer to the question raised in the
preceding verse is that the special fee prescribed for a particular
priest is to be given to that priest only; as it is only thus that the
‘*giving*’ would be done in its real sense; the mention of the priests
in the texts prescribing the fees could not but be for this perceptible
purpose; while in any other case such naming would have to be taken only
as serving some transcendental purpose.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava*, (Vyavahāra, p. 221), to
the effect that it is only the general fee prescribed in connection with
the performance as a whole that it is to be divided among the
priests,—not so the special fee prescribed in connection with a
particular priest, who alone is to receive this latter fee;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (90a), which says that this answers the question raised
in the preceding verse, the answer being that wherever the texts
prescribe a certain article as to be given to a particular person, it
has to be given to that person only.
