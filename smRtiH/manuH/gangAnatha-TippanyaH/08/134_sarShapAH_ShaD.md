The *Kṛṣṇala* is the same as the *Raktikā* (Vern. *Ratti*), equivalent
to 122 grammes or 1.875 grains.

“The tines in court were reckoned as so many *paṇas*, one *paṇa* being
the same as a *karṣa* = 16 *Māṣa* = 80 *Kṛṣṇala*. Some of the weights
mentioned are, confined to gold —*Suvarṇa* and *Niṣka*; some to silver
—*Purāṇa* and *Śatamāna*; and some are used for both—*kṛṣṇala, paṇa
māṣa, pala, dharaṇa*, the last at times of copper.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 666) which explains
‘*madhyaḥ*’ as ‘neither large nor small’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 115), which adds that the name ‘*māṣa*’ is applied to the
sixteenth part of the ‘*suvarṇa*’, and ‘*kṛṣṇala*’ to the third part of
the ‘*kaṛsa*’, which latter is the fifth part of the ‘*māṣa*’. It
remarks that ‘*karṣa*’ is one of the names of silver.

It is quoted in *Hemādri* (Vrata, p. 53);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Dāna,
4a).
