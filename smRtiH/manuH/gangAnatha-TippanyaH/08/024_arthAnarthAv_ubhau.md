‘*Arthānarthāvubhau buddhvā dharmādharmau ca kevalau*’—Medhātithi has
given three explanations of this (See *Translation*):—‘Fully realizing
the wordly evils and advantages, but paying due heed to Dharma and
Adharma as alone conducive to spiritual results’
(Kullūka);—‘discriminating the righteous and the unrighteous, and taking
up the righteous first’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana);—‘knowing what will
please and what displease the people and understanding what is just and
what is unjust’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 46), as laying
down the order in which the king is to take up the cases, when several
come up at the same time;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 80);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru*, (16b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 19a).
