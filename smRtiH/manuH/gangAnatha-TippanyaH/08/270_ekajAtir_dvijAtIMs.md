This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 809);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 153), which adds the following notes:—‘*Ekajāti*’, ‘once-born’, is
the *Śūdra*, since he has no *upanayana* (which is the *second
birth*),—‘*dāruṇayā*’, heartrending, insinuating a heinous crime and so,
forth,—‘*jaghanyaprabhavaḥ*’, the Śruti having described the *Śūdra* as
born from the feet. This implies that in the case of the mixed castes
insulting the twice-born also, the same penalty is meant, since these
also are ‘low-born.’

*Bālambhaṭṭī* (on 1.107) remarks that, inasmuch as in verse 177 the
cutting of the tongue is excluded in the case of the Śūdra insulting the
Vaiśya, what is said in the present verse must be restricted to the
Śūdra insulting either a Brāhmaṇa or a Kṣatriya.
