This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 253), which
explains ‘*satyena*’ as ‘by swearing’;—in ‘*Mitākṣarā* (2.187), which
adds that this applies to cases where the cause of action is slight;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 182), which adds the following notes:—‘*Grāma*’,
is well-known;—‘*deśa*’ consists of a group of villages, a
district;—‘*saṅgha*’ is a corporation composed of several persons
following one ‘dharma,’ living in different places. It is also quoted in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (107a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 132a).
