‘*Gobījakañcanaiḥ*’—‘Threatening him with the guilt of all offences
committed against kine and the rest’ (Medhātithi) ‘with the guilt of the
theft of kine etc.’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘with the
loss of his kine etc.’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘by making him touch the cow and
other things’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 674);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 78), where however the first half is read as “sasyena
śāpayedvi??aṃ kṣanniyaṃ vāhanāyudhaiḥ”;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 215),
which adds:—The Vaiśya is to be admonished with the words:—‘those sins
would accrue to you which are involved in stealing the cow etc. if you
tell a lie and the Śūdra with the words—‘all kinds of sins would fall on
you etc. etc.’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 204);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (33b).
