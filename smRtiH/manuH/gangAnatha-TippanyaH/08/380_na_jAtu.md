This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 681), to the effect that even
though actual death has been prohibited as a penalty for the Brāhmaṇa,
yet there are other penalties which are equal to, and substitutes for,
that penalty;—again on p. 842, where it notes that the banishment here
laid down is meant for cases other than the ‘mortal offences.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 682);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.81), which
remarks that corporeal punishment is never to be inflicted on the
Brāhmaṇa; this is the general law laid down here; and again on 3.267;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 115);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka*. (p. 183),
to the effect that for the Brāhmaṇa there is no death-penalty.
