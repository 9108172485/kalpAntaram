methods of ‘compound interest.’ It adds the following
notes:—‘*Nirjitām*,’ legally due to the creditor; of this accrued
interest he should pay either the whole, or a part only, and add the
remainder to the principal and renew the bond for the total;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 19b);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (80a), which
explains ‘*nirjitām*’ as ‘determined to have already accrued to the
creditor,’—and ‘*karaṇ* *am parivartayet*’ as ‘should write another
