‘*Anubandham*’—‘Motive or frequency’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja)—‘frequency’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Sārāprādhau*’—Nandana reading ‘*Sārāsārau*,’ explains it as ‘strength
or weakness of the offender.’

Tins verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 627), which explains
‘*Sāra*’ as *strength* and ‘*anubandha*’ as ‘repetition of the improper
act.’
