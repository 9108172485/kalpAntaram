This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 836);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
118), which adds the following notes:—‘*Svakarma parihāpayet*,’ *i.e*.,
through sickness or such causes, a part of the sacrificial fee shall be
paid to him, after duly considering the total fee payable for the entire
sacrifice and the part of the work that may have been done by him;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 222), which explains ‘*sahakartṛbhiḥ*’
as ‘by his colleagues’;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 48), which says that
‘if a priest, through disease or other disability, is unable to perform
his work, then he is to be paid his fee in proportion to the work
actually done by him;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (89b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 120a), which explains ‘*sahakartṛbhiḥ*’ as ‘by his
collaborators,’—or the meaning may be ‘he should be paid his share of
the fee, *along with*, at the same time as, the other priests are paid.’
