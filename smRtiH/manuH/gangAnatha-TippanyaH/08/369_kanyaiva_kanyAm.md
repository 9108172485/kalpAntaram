This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which adds that ‘*dviguṇam*’ means ‘double
of 200’;—and ‘*śiphā*’ stands for ‘strokes of creepers, ropes and such
other things’;—in *Aparārka* (p. 859), which adds the following
explanation:—If one maiden happen to penetrate another with her fingers
or some such thing, she shall pay a fine of 200 to the king, and that
fee or *price* which the defiled maiden is worth, *three times* (its
reading being ‘*triguṇam*’ or ‘*dviguṇam*’) that shall be paid to her by
the other girl, who is, in addition, to receive ten stripes—*i.e*.,
strokes of rope or creepers.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288) to the same effect; where it adds
that ‘double the fee’ (*dviguṇam śulkam*) is to be paid by the offending
girl to the *father* of the defiled girl.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1016);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
