This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 808), which adds that ‘*vadha*’
here means ‘cutting off the tongue’;—in *Parāśaramadhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
295);—in *Mitākṣarā*, (2.207),.where *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following
notes:—‘*Adhyardha*,’ 150,—whether it should be 150 or 200 in any
particular case is to depend upon the lightness or gravity of the
offence,—‘*vadha*,’ beating and so forth.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 250), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Ākruśya*’ stands for the ‘middle’ kind of defamation—says
*Pārijāta*;—‘*adhyardham śatam*’, 150,—‘*dve vā*’, this alternative is
prescribed in view of the comparative gravity of the
defamation;—‘*vadha*’, beating, cutting off of the tongue and so forth.

It is quoted’ in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 99);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Vyavahāra, 44b);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 70), which explains
‘*adhyardham*’ as ‘one and a half’, and ‘*vadha*’ as ‘beating’, and says
that the punishment, in the case of the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also, is
for defamation;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 149a).
