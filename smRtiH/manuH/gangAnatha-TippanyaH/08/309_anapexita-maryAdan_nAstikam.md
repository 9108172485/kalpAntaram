‘*Vipralumpakam*’—‘Deserter of the Brāhmaṇa’ (Nandana, whose reading is
‘*vipralopakam*’);—‘who takes property even from a Brāhmaṇa’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘rapacious, *i.e*., who takes (grains &c) improperly’
(Medhātithi).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 255), which
explains ‘*vipralopakam*’ (which is its reading for ‘*vipralumpakam*’)
as ‘one who injures the livelihood of the Brāhmaṇas’,—and ‘*attaram*’,
‘one who enjoys.’
