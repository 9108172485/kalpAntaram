This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 23) \[for whose
explanatory note, see note on verse 144\];—in *Aparārka* (p. 659), which
adds that what is here laid down applies to cases where very little use
has been made of the thing; in cases where the pledged thing has been
very much used, no interest is to be paid; thus the reduction in the
interest has to be determined by the extent of the use to which the
thing may have been put;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru*, (70a).
