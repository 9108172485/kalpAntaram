This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 301), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Āgamam*,’ the import of foreign commodities from
countries either remote and inaccessible, or proximate and easily
accessible—‘*nirgamam*,’ export of commodities of the country to the
said foreign countries;—‘*sthānam*,’ the determining of the expenses
incurred in the storing of the commodity during the larger or shorter
interval between its purchase and sale;—similarily ‘*vṛddhikṣayam*,’ the
profit or loss actually accrued;—‘*vicārya*,’ having fully considered
all this,—the king shall so regulate buying and selling that there may
be no undue profit or loss to the traders.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 827);—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
942).
