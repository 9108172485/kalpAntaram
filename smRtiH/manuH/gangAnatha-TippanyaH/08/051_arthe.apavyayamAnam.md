This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 76), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Āpavyayamānam*’, ‘denying’,—‘*Karaṇena*,’ ‘by
evidence, documentary and otherwise’,—‘*vibhāvitam*’, ‘faced,
convinced’;—such a debtor the king shall compel to pay the amount to the
creditor;—and by reason of the man having denied what was true, the king
shall exact from him a slight fine also.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 153), which adds that
this rule is meant for the case where the debtor is a well behaved
Brāhmaṇa;—in *Vyavahāratattva* (p. 61);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p.
80b).
