This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 396), which adds the
following explanation:—If a Kṣatriya has recourse to an unguarded
Kṣatriya woman, his head shall be wetted with urine and then shaved, or
he may be fined, like the Vaiśya, 500 *paṇas*. It adds that
*Lakṣmīdhara* has read ‘*mauṇḍyameva*’ for ‘*daṇḍameva*’;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1008).
