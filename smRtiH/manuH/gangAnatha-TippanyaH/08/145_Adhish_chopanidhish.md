‘*Upanidhi*’—‘Anything lent through affection, for use’ (Medhāttlii,
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘an additional pledge given in
order to complete the security for the loan’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (47a), which explains ‘*ādhi*’
as ‘pledged property’, and ‘*upanidhi*’ as property mortgaged and
allowed to be used, such as agricultural land and so forth it cannot
stand for property in the form of a sealed packet, as such property
cannot be used.
