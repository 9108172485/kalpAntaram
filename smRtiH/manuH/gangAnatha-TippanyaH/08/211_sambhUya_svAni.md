This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 221), which
remarks that this distribution pertains to only cases where the thing to
be divided is mentioned as common to all;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (90a);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 119b), which says that this refers, *not*
to the fee that is prescribed for individual priests, but to the *common
fee* of 1200 cows, which is prescribed for all the officiating priests.
