This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 357), which notes that
‘*tyāga*,’ ‘abandonment,’ here means ‘not according such treatment to
them as has been prescribed in the scriptures’;—and that ‘*strī*’ here
stands for the *wife*.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 823), which remarks that this rule refers
to the abandoning of all the four collectively;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(p. 154).
