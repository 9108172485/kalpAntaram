‘*Niṣkulāsu*’—‘Those women who have no brother-in-law, or uncle to take
care of them’ (Medhātithi and

Rāghavānanda);—‘harlots’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi);—‘those *maidens*
whose family is extinct’ (Govindarāja);—‘those who have no Sapiṇḍas’
(Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 512), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Vaśā*’, barren woman,—‘*aputrā*’, one who has lost
her son,—‘*Niṣkulā*’ one who has lost all her paternal and maternal
relations.
