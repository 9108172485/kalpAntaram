‘*Dvādaśakam*’—‘*Twelve paṇas*’ (Kullūka and Medhātithi, who does not
say ‘*palas*,’ as asserted by Buhler);—‘twelve times the value of the
yarn’(Govindarāja);—‘one-twelth of the value of the yarn’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 785), which explains
‘*dvādaśakam*’ as ‘fine consisting of 12 *kārṣāpaṇas*’;—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 311), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tantuvāya*,’ the weaver of cloth, having received 10 *palas* of
yarn, shall, after weaving it, give to the owner cloth weighing 11
*palas*; otherwise acting,—*i.e*., having received 10 *palas* of yam, if
he gives cloth weighing only 10 *palas*,—he should pay a fine. It adds
that this rule refers to coarse yams.
