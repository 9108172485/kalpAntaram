Medhātithi is again misrepresented by Buhler; he does not read
‘*apadeśyam*’, the reading adopted by him being ‘*adeśam*’. Nārāyaṇa
also reads the same, not ‘*apadeśyam*.’—Nandana reads ‘*adeyam*’, not
‘*apadeśyam*.’ Buhler has apparently confused verse 53 with 54, where
Medhātithi reads ‘*apadeśam*’ for ‘*apadeśyam*.’

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 108), which has
the following explanation—‘One who cites an impossible witness, or
having cited a possible one, says that he has not cited him, or one who
does not perceive inconsistencies in his own statement, is to be
non-suited;’—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 22b), which has the following
notes:—‘*Adeśam*’ (which is its reading for ‘*adeśyam*’), a place where
the parties have never met;—‘*adharottarān arthān*’, “former and
latter”—‘*vigītān*’, contradictory;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
p. 31b), which adds the following notes:—‘*Ādeśyām dishati*’, ‘says what
is irrelevant or indecorous,—he who having said something says he did
not say it’—‘who does not comprehend the inconsistencies in his own past
and present statements’.
