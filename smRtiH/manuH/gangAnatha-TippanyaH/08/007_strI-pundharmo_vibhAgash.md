‘*samāhvayaḥ*’ as ‘gambling with animals,’ and notes that though theft,

applies also to those who, though not themselves kings, are appointed by
the king to work for him;—‘seated or standing’ may be options to be
determined by the king’s capacity, or by the respectability or otherwise
of the parties appearing before him the raising of the right arm is for
calling the attention of suitors; the dress etc. are to be humble, so
that the parties may not be confounded by his gorgeous
attire;—‘*pratyaham*’ shows that cases should be tried every day ;—‘
*deśadṛṣṭa*’ are those customs and arguments that may have local
application, such as the customs regarding the betrothal of girls
(described above) among ‘northerners.’
