This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.286) as permitting the wielding
of weapons by the Brāhmaṇas;—in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 77);—and in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 60), which explains the last clause to mean that
‘the case is not that of one man killing another, but the animosity of
one man (the killer) destroying the animosity of another (the killed);’
it adds Vaśiṣṭha’s definition of the *ātatāyin*—‘one who sets fire to
houses, or administers poison, or who is going to strike with a weapon,
or who robs one of his property, or who takes forcible possession of
one’s fields, or of one’s wife,—these six are *ātatāyins*.’
