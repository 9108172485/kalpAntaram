The amount to be taken depends ‘upon the character of the finder’
(Medhātithi, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda),—or ‘on the caste of the finder’
(Nārāyaṇa),—or, ‘on the time, place, the caste of the finder and so
forth’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 641), which adds that the amount
of the royalty shall be determined in due accordance with the character
(of the claimant, and of the treasure);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.34-35),
which notes that the proportion of the royalty is to be determined by
considerations of the caste of the claimant, the nature of the place and
time and such other details;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 642), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Nidhi*’ here stands for ‘treasure buried
underground long ago and forgotten’,—whether the king shall receive the
sixth or twelfth part shall depend upon the virtuous character or
otherwise of the person claiming it.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 88), which appears to take the
meaning to be that the king shall take the sixth part for the state,
*and also* the twelfth part for the person who discovered the treasure.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 269), which adds that the
exact proportion shall depend upon the time and upon the qualifications
of the owner of the treasure;—and that this refers to treasure belonging
to others than the Brāhmaṇas.
