‘*Niranvaye*’—‘(*a*) Friendly leading, or, (*b*) neighbourliness, or
(*c*) absence of watchman’ (Medhātithi);—Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa have
(*a*);—and Kullūka and Rāghavānanda have (*b*).—See 198 above.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 324), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Paripūteṣu*,’ husked,—‘*niranvaye*,’ (the
appropriating being done) without any such justification as friendship
and the like; in view of the present rule being inconsistent with what
Manu has himself said in regard to ‘*vadha*’ being the penalty for
stealing more than 10 *kumbhas* of grains, and ‘eleven times’ the fine
for stealing lesser quantities,—people have held that the present rule
is meant for thefts from the harvesting yard, the heavier penalties
being for thefts from the houses.
