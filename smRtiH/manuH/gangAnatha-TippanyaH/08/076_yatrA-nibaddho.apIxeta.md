‘*Anibaddhaḥ*’—‘Not entered as a witness in the document’
(Medhātithi),‘—but accidentally present at the transaction’ (Kullūka,
Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāratattva* (p. 26);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(28a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 46a), which explains
‘*anibaddhaḥ*’ as ‘not cited or entered.’
