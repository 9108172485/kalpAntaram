This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.204), which notes that this rule
refers to a case where the defamer is a very wicked person; and
*Bālambhaṭṭī* has the following notes:—‘*Tathyena*,’ even in
truth,—‘*kārṣāpaṇāvaram*,’ at least one *kārṣāpaṇa*, never less than
that; this refers to cases where a wicked and ill-behaved person insults
a caste-fellow.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 806), which adds that this refers to a
case where the insulter is a man with very superior qualifications, or
where the motive of insulting is very insignificant.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 247), which explains
‘*kārṣāpaṇāvaram*’ as ‘that than which one *kārṣā* *paṇa* is lower,’
*i.e*., ‘two *kārṣāpaṇas*—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 295),
which adds that this refers to an extremely wicked person;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 44b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
150a).
