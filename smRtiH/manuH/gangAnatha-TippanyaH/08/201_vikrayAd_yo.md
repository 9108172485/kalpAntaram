This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 103), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Vikrayāt*,’ from the market-place;—‘*Kulasannidhau*,’
in the presence of trustworthy traders and brokers;—‘*Nyāyataḥ*,’
qualifies ‘*krayeṇa*’;—‘*viśuddhaḥ*’ (which is its reading for
‘*viśuddham*,’) faultless;—‘*labhate dhanam*’, *i.e*., from the
seller;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (85b), which has the following
notes:—‘*Vikrayāt*,’ ‘from the ‘*market place*,’ the word being
explained as ‘*vikrīyate asmin iti vikrayaḥ*,’—‘*kulasannidhau*,’ in the
presence of a number of business-men,—‘*nyāyataḥ*’ is to be construed
with ‘*krayeṇa*,’ and means a *bona fide* purchase, on payment of the
proper price.
