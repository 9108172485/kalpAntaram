Verses 59-61 are not omitted by Medhātithi, as wrongly asserted by
Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 77), which adds the
following explanation:—When the defendant, through dishonest motives,
denies the claim,—or when the plaintiff prefers a false claim,—both
those are dishonest dealers, and they should be punished with a fine,
which is the double of the amount of the claim;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p.
34), which says that this rule refers to cases where the culprit is very
wealthy;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (80b).
