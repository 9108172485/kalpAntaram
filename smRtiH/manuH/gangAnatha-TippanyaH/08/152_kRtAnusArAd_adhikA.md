This verse in quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 14), which adds the
following explanations:—Any interest, over and above what has been
prescribed in the scriptures,—such as

2 per cent and so forth,—cannot be permitted, even though agreed to by
the debtor;—why?—because they declare this to be the ‘usurious way’. If,
under the stress of business, the creditor wishes to reap a large profit
out of the debtor, then the utmost that he can recover is 5 per
cent,—and not more, even though the debtor may have agreed to it;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 68b).
