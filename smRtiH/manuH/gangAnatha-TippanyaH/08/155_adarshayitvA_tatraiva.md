This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 73), which adds the
following notes:—‘*adarśayitvā hiraṇyam*’, not bringing up the gold for
payment,—not even a single pice,—and hence not paying even the interest,
he should add the accrued interest to the original principal, and making
this total the new principal, he should enter it in the new bond that he
should write. Though the entire interest is actually due to be paid at
the time, yet, if he is unable to pay the whole, he may pay just that
much of it which he may be able to pay;—this is what is meant by the
clause ‘*yāvatī sambhavet etc*.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 194), which adds the
following explanation:—‘*Hiraṇyam adarśayitvā*’,—not having paid the
interest that has been earned,—he should have it included in that same
bond;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (80a), which explains ‘*hiraṇyam adarśayitvā*’
as ‘not paying any part of the accrued interest to the Creditor,’ the
meaning is that he should pay as much of the accrued interest as hew
can, and then make out a fresh document;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 104a).
