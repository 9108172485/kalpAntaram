‘*Arthasambandhinaḥ*’—‘Persons having money-dealings with either of the
two parties’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘having an interest in the suit’ (Nārāyaṇa and
Medhātithi, alternatively); ‘who have received benefits from the
parties’ (Nandana).

‘*Sahāyāḥ*’—‘Sureties and the like’ (Medhātithi);—‘Servants’ (Kullūka
and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 66);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (p. 281);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p.
10a);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (29b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
49a), which says that these texts set forth those qualities, which make
a man unreliable as a witness, and it reproduces Medhātithi’s
explanations of the words.
