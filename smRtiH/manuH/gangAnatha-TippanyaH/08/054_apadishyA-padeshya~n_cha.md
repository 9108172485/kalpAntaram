‘*Praṇihitam*’—‘Duly stated by himself’ (Kullūka and Nandana);—‘stated
by himself in the plaint’ (Govindarāja); ‘duly ascertained’
(Rāghavānanda and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* which has the following
notes:—‘*Apadiśya*’, having put forward,—‘*apadeśam*’,
pretext,—‘*apadhāvati*’,—retracts,—‘*samyak praṇihitam artham*,’ what
has been stated clearly and definitely,—‘*pṛsṭaḥ*’, questioned as to
what he has to say as against the statement of the other party, or what
proofs he has in support of his own statement;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 31b), which has the following explanations:—‘He who slinks
away from the court under some pretext’,—‘who does not pay heed—by
answering,—to what has been said by others, even though fully
comprehending what has been said’;—it quotes Medhātithi as reading
‘*adeśam*’ and reproduces his several explanations.
