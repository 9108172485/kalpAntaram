**(verses 8.348-349)**

These verses are quoted half and half in *Aparārka* (p. 1043).

They are quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 784), which adds the following
notes :—‘*Kālakārite viplave*’, ‘if there is interference with the
sacred duties due either to the tendencies of the king or to the
tendency of the times,’—‘*tat paritrāṇe saṅgare*’, ‘if fighting ensues
for the safety of those’;—‘*abhyupapatti*’ is
‘preservation’;—‘*dharmeṇa*’, ‘not by dishonest weapons or by dishonest
methods.’

The first half of verse 348 is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.286) in support
of the view that, in certain cases—when, for instance, one finds the
paramour with his wife, and there would be delay if he were to lodge a
regular complaint before the king,—the man would be justified in taking
up a weapon and killing the paramour. *Bālambhaṭṭī* explains the entire
verse:—‘(1) When arrogant persons prevent Brāhmaṇas from performing
their sacred duties; (2) when, on the waning of royal authority due to
foreign invasion, one has to take care of himself, (3) when one has to
enter a fray for the preserving of cows &c., (4) or for the safety of
women and Brāhmaṇas;—if one fights in a lawful manner, he incurs no
sin.’
