This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 514);—in
*Aparārka* (p. 610), which explains that ‘*kilviṣam*’ means ‘an offence
deserving punishment’;—again on p. 817, where ‘*kilviṣam*’ is explained
as ‘punishment’;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 271), which explains
‘*pṛṣṭhataḥ*’ as ‘not in a vital part,’ and ‘*uttamāṅge*’ also as ‘in a
vital part’;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 530);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.32), in
support of the view that, if, in a fit of passion, the Teacher should
strike the pupil in a vital part of the body, and the boy should
complain before the king, then it becomes an admissible suit;—in
*Vyavahāra-Balambhaṭṭī* (pp. 572 and 919);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra, 47b);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 52) to the effect that no one
should be struck on the head;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p, 315), which
says that ‘*uttamāṅga*’ means ‘head’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
142);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 76).
