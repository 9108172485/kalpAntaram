‘*Hanti*’—‘Destroys—*i.e*., leads to hell’ (Medhātithi on 98, and
Nārāyaṇa and Kullūka);—‘makes to fall from heaven, or makes to be born
among lower animals’ (Rāghavānanda);—‘incurs the guilt of killing them’
(Kullūka, alternative).

‘*Saumya*’—Addressed to Bhṛgu (Medhātithi), but later on under 99, he
rejects the view and says that it must be taken as addressed to the
witness giving evidence.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 674);—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 205);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru*, (35b).
