“According to Rāghavānanda the rule refers to Śūdras assaulting Śūdras.
According to Nārāyaṇa, the last offender’s property shall be
confiscated.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 164), which remarks that
in view of the law laid down by Viṣṇu, that for causing bleeding the
fine shall be 64 *paṇas*,—the penalty here laid down should be
understood to be applicable to cases where there is much bleeding caused
by the tearing of the skin.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 287);—in *Aparārka* (p.
815) which adds that, the bleeding is due to grievous hurt, then the
fine is to be 100, otherwise 64;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.218), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* remarks that the penalty here laid down applies to cases
where the hurt has been inflicted on some vital part of the body;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 74), which explains ‘*niṣka*’ as
equivalent to four ‘*suvarṇas*’
