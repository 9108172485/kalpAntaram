This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 152), to the effect that the
witnesses, the Sāmantas and others should indicate the boundary after
being put on oath.

It adds that the plural number in ‘*nayeyuḥ*’ indicates that the
boundary cannot be determined on the basis of only *two* witnesses; the
admission of one being permitted by Nārada.

*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—‘*Svaiḥ svaiḥ*’ means ‘by the
deeds of the caste to which each of them belongs’, —‘*urvīm*’, a piece
of earth,—‘*tām*’ (which is its reading for ‘*tam*’)
boundary,—‘*Samañjasam*’ is an adverb modifying the verb ‘*nayeyuḥ*.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 762);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 111b);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 141a).
