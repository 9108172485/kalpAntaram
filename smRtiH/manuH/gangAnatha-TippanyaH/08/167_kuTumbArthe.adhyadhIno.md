‘*Adhyadhīnaḥ*’—‘Servant’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa);—‘slave’
(Kullūka);—‘Youngest brother and one in some such position
(Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 232) as indicating the
necessary character of the maintaining of the family;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 55), which explains ‘*Ādhyadhīna*’ as ‘servants
and others,’ and ‘*jyāyān*’ as ‘the master’;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 164), to the effect that a debt cannot be repudiated if
it has been contracted for the support of the family, even if it may
have been contracted by a dependant without the master’s permission;—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (76b), which explains ‘*adhyadhīnaḥ*’ as ‘the slave and
the like—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 40a), which explains
‘*adhyadhīnaḥ*’ *as* ‘son, nephew, slaves and so forth.’
