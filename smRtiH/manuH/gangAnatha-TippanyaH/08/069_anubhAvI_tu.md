This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 671), which adds that
‘*anubhāvi*’ means an *eye-witness*, one who has actually seen the
occurrence;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 214);—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 181), which explains’ ‘*anubhāvi*’ as ‘one conversant
with the facts of the case’;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (3a), which explains
‘*anubhāvi*’ as ‘one who has had *anubhāva*, experience’;—and in
‘*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 51a), which has the same explanation of
‘*anubhāvi*.’
