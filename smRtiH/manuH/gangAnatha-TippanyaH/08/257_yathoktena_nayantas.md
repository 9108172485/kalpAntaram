This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.153), as laying down the penalty
for witnesses lying in connection with boundaries;—in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 211), which explains ‘*Satyasākṣinaḥ*’ as ‘those persons who depose
truthfully to the boundary,’—and ‘*dviśatam*’ as ‘two hundred
*paṇas*’;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 97);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p.
95);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (112a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
141a).
