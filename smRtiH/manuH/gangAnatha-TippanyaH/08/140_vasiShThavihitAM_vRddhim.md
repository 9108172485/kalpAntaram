This rule, here attributed to Vasiṣṭha, actually occurs in
Vasiṣṭha-Dharmaśāstra, 2.51.

“According to Kullūka, (on 142), Nārāyaṇa, Rāghavānanda and Nandana,
this rule refers to a debt secured by a pledge, find the correctness of
this view is proved by the parallel passage of Yājñavalkya
(2.37).”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, p. 7, which explains
‘*māsāt*’ as ‘after the lapse of one month,’ and adds that this refers
to debt that is secured by a pledge that can be enjoyed (by the
creditor).

*Smṛtitattva* (p. 349) quotes the second half and adds that ‘of 100
*kārṣāpaṇas*’, the ‘eightieth part’ would be 20 *paṇas*.

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 420), which explains
‘*aśītibhāgam*’ as 20 *paṇas*;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 325);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 91b), which says that this refers to cases
of mortgage, and the meaning is that when 100 rupees have been advanced,
the creditor should charge 1¼ rupee after the lapse of one month.
