‘*Śāstrāntareṇa*’—(Medhātithi, p. 965, l. 1)—This refers to Yājñavalkya,
2.65. ‘*Vāsanasthamanākhyāya haste nyasya yadarpayet*’; and
Nārada—‘*asaṅkhyātamavijñātam samudram yannidhīyate*.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 109), which
adds that the term ‘*śrotriya*’ includes also all such persons who have
their attention too much taken up by other things to allow their looking
after their belongings in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 158), which
notes the following reasons for neglect—(*a*) In regard to boundaries,
people are apt to be lulled into security by the ease with which the
boundary-line can be determined,—(*b*) in regard to women, their natural
shyness lulls men into security,—(*c*) in the case of the king and the
scholar, their minds are too much taken up with their temporal and
spiritual concerns respectively;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Vyavahāra,
69b).
