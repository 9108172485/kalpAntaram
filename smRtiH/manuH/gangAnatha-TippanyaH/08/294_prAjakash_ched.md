**(verse 8.293)**

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 863), which explains ‘*prājaka*’
as the *driver* and ‘*swāmi*’ as the man riding in the chariot;—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which explains the meaning to be that, in a case
where the chariot goes astray on account of the inefficiency of the
driver, and causes hurt to some one, a fine of 200 should be imposed on
the owner of the chariot for the offence of having engaged an inept
driver;—in *Bālambhaṭṭī* (2.299) which adds the same explanation as the
one just given;—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 282), which adds the
following notes:—In a case where the owner of the chariot has employed
an inefficient driver, and the horses go astray by reason of the
driver’s inefficiency, and if there be any damages caused by this, then
the owner should be fined 200.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1041).

**(verse 8.294)**

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 282), to the effect that
in a case where the driver is efficient, the punishment shall be
inflicted upon him; and it explains ‘*āptaḥ*’ as ‘fully expert’;—and in
*Mitākṣarā* (2.300) which adds, that if the owner employs an expert
driver, then it is the driver that is to be punished, not the owner;—and
in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1042).
