“Men from the four surrounding villages are meant, as Kullūka suggests.
The correctness of this opinion is proved by the fact that the land
grants usually mention the four boundaries of the villages given
away.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.152), which remarks that
neighbours are to be called in only in the absence of regular witnesses.
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the note that the number ‘four’ stands for any number
from *four* upwards,—and that the epithet ‘*prayatāḥ*’ precludes the
calling of wicked men.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 760);—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 206),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Grāmāḥ*,’
villagers,—‘*simāntavāsinaḥ*,’ persons living near (the disputed
boundary),—‘*vinirṇayam kuryuḥ*,’ should determine the boundary on the
basis of the tradition current among them. It explains ‘*sāmanta*’ as
‘persons living near the disputed boundary.’

*Aparārka* (p. 759) has explained the term ‘*sāmanta*’ as ‘people seen
near the spot,’ ‘*samantataḥ ye upalakṣyante*.’ Hence Medhātithi’s
reading ‘*sāmantavāsinaḥ*’ is to be explained as ‘*grāmasya samantāt
vāsinaḥ*,’ ‘people living near about the village.’

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (111a).
