Mss. N and S place 317 and its *Bhāṣya* after 318 but both add a note to
the effect—‘*ayam shloko rājabhirityasmāt pūrvam lekhanīyaḥ*’, ‘this
verse should be written after the verse *rājabhiḥ &c*.’ This is
apparently a corrector’s note on the mistake committed by a copyist.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Āhnika, p. 509), which adds the
following note:—‘*Kilviṣam*’ is to be construed with each of the
four—‘*annāda*’, ‘*pati*’, ‘*guru*’ and ‘*rājā*’—and ‘*mārṣṭi*’ means
‘passes on.’

It is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 146), which explains ‘*mārṣṭi*’
as ‘transfer’;—and in *Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 781).
