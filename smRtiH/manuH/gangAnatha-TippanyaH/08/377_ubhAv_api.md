This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra p. 318);—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106);—and in *Mitāk* *ṣarā* (2.286), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—If a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya have
intercourse with a guarded Brāhmaṇa woman, he should be punished like a
Śūdra, *i*. *e*., deprived of his whole body and his entire property
(according to 374); *i.e*., his entire property should be confiscated
and he should be put to death;—another alternative penalty prescribed is
that he should be put to death, without any confiscation of property;
and it is by means of the ‘*Kaṭāgni*’ that he is to be put to death.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 155b).
