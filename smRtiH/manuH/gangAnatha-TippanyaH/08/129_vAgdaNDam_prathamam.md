This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.366), which, in quoting it,
transposes, ‘*vāgdaṇḍam*’ and ‘*dhigdaṇḍam*,’—such reading is more in
keeping with Yājñvalkya’s text (1.356),—and it explains ‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’ as
addressing such terms as ‘fie upon thee,’—and ‘*vāgdaṇḍa*’ as
‘pronouncing a terrible curse

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 156); as laying down
the order of sequence among the various forms of punishment; it explains
*vāgdaṇḍa* as pronouncing a terrible curse (reproducing the exact words
of Mitākṣarā) and ‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’ as ‘chiding with such words as *fie* and
the like.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 630), which adds the following
notes:—‘*vāgdaṇḍa*’, ‘thou hast not done right,’—‘*dhigdaṇḍa*’, ‘fie
upon thee, damned sinner.’

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 273), which adds the
following notes:—The first two forms of punishment are meant for light
offences; ‘*vadhadaṇḍa*’ means *corporal punishment*, which has to be
inflicted upon all except the Brāhmaṇas.
