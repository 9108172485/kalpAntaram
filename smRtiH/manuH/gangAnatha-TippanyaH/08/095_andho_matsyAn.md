This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 205), whiqḥ says
that according to some

people, this and the preceding two verses are to be addressed to
witnesses of the lower order only; hence in ordinary cases, after
‘*kurūn gamaḥ*’, the exhortation should begin with ‘*yāvato bāndhavān*
&c.’ (verse 97);—these exhortations are to be addressed to Śūdras and to
poverty-stricken twice-born persons also;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (35b).
