This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 53), which adds the term
‘*svataḥ*’, which means ‘out of their own property’, and implies that in
a case where even among divided co-sharers, if one has contracted a debt
for the purpose of the maintenance of all co-sharers, and he, for some
reason or other, such as death and so forth, is unable to repay it—then
the debt should be paid by all the other co-sharers.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 647);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 178),
which explains ‘*svātaḥ*’ as ‘from his own property;’—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (76a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 110a), which
says that the explanation given by the ‘Vṛttikāra’ is that ‘when a man
who borrowed the money goes away or dies, and the money was spent by him
for his family, then the debt is to be repaid *even* by such of his
collaterals as may have been living separately from him’,—what to say,
regarding those who might have been living with him. It demurs to this
explanation and quotes the explanation of the ‘Mahābhāṣya’ as that
separated collaterals, like the uncle and so forth, should repay the
debt out of their own property.
