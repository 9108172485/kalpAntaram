This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 663);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 91), which adds the following explanation:—The depository, who, even
when asked to do so, does not surrender the deposit,—or the other party
who demands the deposit, without having delivered it,—both of these
should be punished like a thief, if the property involved is a large
one; but if it is a small one, then they have to be fined the value of
the deposit in question, and the depository is to be forced to surrender
the deposit also.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha*, (p. 84);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 208);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 89), which notes that in
the same text the Matsyapurāṇa reads ‘*dviguṇam damam*’; it says that
Manu’s rule is meant for cases where the persons concerned are poor and
well-behaved;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (83b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 113a), whieh explains ‘*śāsyau*’ as ‘should be punished and
fined.’
