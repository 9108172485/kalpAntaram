‘*Tirohitam*’—‘Concealed’—‘in cloth or some such cover’ (Medhātithi and
Nārāyaṇa),—‘in the earth’ (Nandana),—‘covered with paint’ (Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 199), which reads
*saṃsṛṣṭam rūpam* for ‘*saṃsṛṣṭarūpam*’ and adds the following
notes:—‘*Anyat*’, saffron and such costly tilings,—‘*anyena*’ the
Kusumbha flower and such cheaper tilings,—‘*saṃsṛṣṭam*,’
adulterated,—‘*rūpam*,’ commodity,—‘*sāvadyam*,’ defective,—this last is
meant to include all defects other than those just
specified;—‘*nyūnam*,’ less in weight—‘*dure*,’ being at a distance and
hence incapable of having its defects detected,—‘*tirohitam*,’ covered
by cloth or some such thing;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (110a).
