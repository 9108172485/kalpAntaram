This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 814);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 268), which adds the following notes:—‘*Sahāsanamabhiprepsuḥ*’
sitting on the same seat,—‘*abhiprepsu*’ (lit. *desirous of getting at*)
standing here for actually *getting at* itself,—the man sitting upon the
same seat with his superior should be ‘branded on his hip and
banished—‘*utkṛṣṭa*,’ the Brāhmaṇa, ‘*apakṛṣṭaja*,’ the
Śūdra,—‘*kṛtāṅkah*’, branded with red hot iron,—‘*spicha*,’ a part of
the loin;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p.75), which says that the
‘branding’ is to be done with iron, and that ‘*spicha*’ is a part of the
waist.
