This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.151), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds
the following notes ‘*Upacchannāni*,’ almost hidden,—‘*nityam*’, at all
times,—‘*viparyayam*’, mistake,—this indicates the reasons for
establishing other boundary marks.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 203), which explains
‘*Upacchannāni*’ as *hidden*,—and ‘*anyāni*’ as standing for ‘stones’
and other things mentioned in the following verses;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 93).
