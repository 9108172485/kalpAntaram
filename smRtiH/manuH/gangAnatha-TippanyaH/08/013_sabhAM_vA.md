This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 604);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.2), in
support, of the view that the assessors duly appointed incur sin if they
do not, check the king in the event of his taking an illegal course; but
as regards other people present, these incur sin only if they either
speak falsely or suppress the truth,—and not for not checking the
king;—and again on 2.83;—and also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p.
12a).
