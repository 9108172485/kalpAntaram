This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p; 283), which notes that the
‘*māṣaka*’ is equal to two *kṛṣṇalas*, as declared by *Pārijāta*;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 291);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.300), where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—For the killing of a donkey, or
goat, or sheep, the fine consists in *silver*, 5 *Māsas* in weight, and
not *gold*, and for the killing of a dog or a pig, one *Māṣa* of silver.
It notes both the readings, ‘*pāñcamāṣikaḥ*... *māṣikaḥ*’ and
‘*pañcamāṣakaḥ...... māṣakaḥ*’.
