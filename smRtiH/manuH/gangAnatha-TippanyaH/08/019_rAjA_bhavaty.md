This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 604);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 26), to the effect that the king becomes absolved from
all sin if he shows complete impartiality;—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 200)
which adds the following notes:—‘*Kartāram*’ means the ‘speaker’, the
perjuror,—the term ‘*rājā*’ here stands for the Judge, —‘*anenāḥ*’ means
‘free from sin’;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 48);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 5a).
