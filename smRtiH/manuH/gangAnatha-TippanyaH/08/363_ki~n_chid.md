‘*Pravrajitāsu*’—‘Women without protectors’ (Medhātithi);—‘Female
mendicants (Nārāyaṇa);—‘nuns’ (Kulluka);—‘Buddhist and other nuns’
(Rāghavānanda and Rāmacandra).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 387), to the effect that
even in the case of the said women, if the man holds conversation
secretly, he is to be punished. It adds the following
notes:—‘*Praiṣyāsu*,’ slave-girls,—‘*ekabhaktāsu*,’ a woman kept by one
man only,—‘*pravrajitāsu*,’ ‘Buddhist and other nuns’;—‘*kiñcit*, *i*.
*e*., something less than the ‘*Suvarṇa*’ which has been prescribed (in
verse 361) as the fine.

It is quoted in *Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 285), to the effect that even in the
case of the wives of actors and the rest, if a man holds conversation in
solitary places, he should be fined some little amount; as these also
are ‘wives of other men;’ similarly some little fine is to be imposed
for conversing with such women as kept slave-girls, nuns and so forth.
