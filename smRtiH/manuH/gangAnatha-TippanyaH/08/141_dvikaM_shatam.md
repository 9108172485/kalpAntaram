This applies to debts not secured by a pledge—say Nārāyaṇa and
Rāghavānanda;—according to Medhātithi this higher rate is permitted for
those who have a large family to support and hence require a huge income
from their loan-transactions.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 349), which adds that
‘*Dvikam*’ means *two Purāṇas*;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 8);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 420), which explains ‘*Dvikam*’ as
*Purāṇas*;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (81a).
