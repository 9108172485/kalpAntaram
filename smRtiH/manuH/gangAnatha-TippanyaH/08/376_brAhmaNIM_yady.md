This vérse is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106);—in *Mitākṣarā*
(2.286); where *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that in ‘*pañcaśatam*’ we have
*Bahuvrīhi* compound; and notes that the penalty for a *Kṣatriya* is
double that for a *Vaiśya*, because it is the function of the former to
protect and guard people from all kinds of harm; and that the fine of
500 prescribed for the Vaiśya is meant for that case where he does it
under the impression that the woman is a Śūdra, or for that where the
woman concerned is merely Brāhmaṇa by birth and is entirely devoid of
all Brāhmaṇical virtues.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 156a).
