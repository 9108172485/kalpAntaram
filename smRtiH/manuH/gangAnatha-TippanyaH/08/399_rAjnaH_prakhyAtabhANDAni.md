This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 300), which adds the
following notes:—Those objects that are specially fit for a king’s
use—such as large elephants, and so forth—as also those the export of
which is prohibited, such as grains and other things difficult to obtain
in the country, and hence not to be sold to foreign countries,—if,
through greed, merchants should export such articles to foreign
countries, they should have all their property confiscated by the king,
*i.e*., he should take away all that the man may have earned over the
commodity.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 817); and again on p. 834;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 174);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
954);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 119), which has the following
explanation—‘Such elephants, horses and other things as are fit for the
king only,—and things of which all buying and selling have been
prohibited by the king,—if any one sells these in open defiance of the
royal command, all that he obtains by this selling should be confiscated
by the king.’
