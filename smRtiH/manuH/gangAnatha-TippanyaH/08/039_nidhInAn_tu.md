title = "039 निधीनान् तु"

+++
This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 267), which adds
that this verse is supplementary to 38, and notes that the second half,
which the king should deposit in his treasury (in terms of verse 38), is
to be so kept with the clear purpose of handing it over to the rightful
claimant when he turns up.
