This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 319), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Sandhātā*,’ one who ties up with a view to taking it
away;—similarly ‘*vimokṣakaḥ*’ (which is its reading for ‘*ca
mokṣakaḥ*’), is one who sets it free with the intention of taking
it;—‘*caurakilviṣam*,’ the penalty for theft, corporal or monetary;—and
in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 136) which explains the meaning to be that the
punishment is to be meted out to (1) the person who tethers untethered
cattle for the purpose of taking it away, or (2) one who untethers those
that are tethered, for taking them away, or (3) one who deprives one of
any one of the properties mentioned,—*i*.*e*. the share and the rest.’
