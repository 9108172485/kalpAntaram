“According to Kullūka, who relies on a passage of Bṛhaspati, these
objects are to be placed in jars.” (Buhler.)

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2-151), whereon *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Yāni*’ other things similar to those just
mentioned,—‘*sīmāyām*’, on the boundary that has got to be
marked,—‘*sandhi*’, meeting point of the boundaries.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 203), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Evamprakārāṇi*,’ such as pebbles and so forth;—and in
‘*Vivādacintāmaṇi*’ (p. 93).
