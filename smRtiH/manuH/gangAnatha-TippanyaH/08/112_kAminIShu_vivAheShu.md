This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 229), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kāminīṣu*,’ when conversing with a woman in secret
one may swear falsely for the purpose of satisfying her;—similarly for
the purpose of bringing about a marriage, for obtaining food for cows,
for obtaining fuel necessary for offerings, and for saving a
Brāhmaṇa;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 406).
