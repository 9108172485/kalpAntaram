‘*Sahasram*’—“Copper *paṇas* are meant”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (1.366), which remarks that the
fines here prescribed pertain to offences committed unintentionally;—in
*Aparārka*, (p. 592), which adds that these pertain to slight
offences;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 665);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti,
p. 295), which reproduces the words of *Aparārka*;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 938);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 192),
which says that the numbers refer to *copper kārṣāpaṇas*.
