This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣara* (2.275), to the effect that there is
no punishment for way-farers stealing some little things on the way.
*Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following notes:—‘*Adhvāga*,’
way-farer,—‘*kṣīṇavṛttiḥ*,’ with his food-supply exhausted.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 314);—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 146), which explains ‘*kṣīṇavṛttiḥ*’ as having no
food for the journey;—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 124).
