This verse is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 24a):—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (102a), winch adds the explanation that the man who had
stopped the work through some disability—if, on recovery, he comes and
completes the stipulated work, then, if it were done after a lapse of
time, he should receive his wages.
