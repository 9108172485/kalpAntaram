According to ‘others’ in Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa, the verse describes
three distinct penalties for women of the three distinct castes.
Govindarāja and Kullūka hold that in any one case, whether one or the
other of the three penalties shall be inflicted will depend upon the
circumstances of that case.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which explains ‘*strī*’ as a woman who is
herself not a maiden;—in *Aparārka* (p. 859), which says *strī* meant
here is ‘other than a maiden’, the ‘maiden’ having been already dealt
with in the preceding verse;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288), which, explains
‘*strī*’as ‘a grown up experienced woman’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 157a), which explains ‘*prakuryāt*’ as ‘causes penetration.’
