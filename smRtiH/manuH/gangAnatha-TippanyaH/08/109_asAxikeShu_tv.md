‘*Śapathena*’—‘Supernatural proof’ (Medhātithi);—‘oath’—‘touching of the
head and so forth’ (Nārāyaṇa),—or declaring ‘may heinous sins accrue to
me if what I have said turns out to be untrue’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 694), which adds that
‘*asākṣikeṣu*’ means ‘in cases where no human evidence is
available’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 71b), which explains
‘*asākṣikeṣu*’ in the same manner.
