This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 663), which adds that if out of
the property, the man extracts not even a small part (then he shall not
have to make it good);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 88), which also adds—‘if
out of the deposited property, the depository does not extract, take
out, anything;’—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 206), which adds—‘if
he extract even the smallest part of the deposit, then he shall have to
make it good;’—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 37), which says that in a
case where the deposit-holder takes for himself a portion of the deposit
and keeps the remainder secretly in some other place with a view to
evade the return of the trust,—then he is to be made to refund the
entire deposit.

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 83 a), which explains ‘*tasmāt na
saṃharati*’ as ‘does not take for himself any part of the deposit.’
