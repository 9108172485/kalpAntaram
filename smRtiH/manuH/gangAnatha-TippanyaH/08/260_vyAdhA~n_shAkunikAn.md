‘*Vanācāriṇaḥ*’—‘Those who roam about forests in search of flowers,
fruits and fuel’ (Medhātithi);—‘*śabaras* and other foresters’
(Nārāyaṇa).

*Medhātithi* does not read ‘*śataśaḥ*’ as Hopkins says.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.152), on which *Bālambhaṭṭī* has
the following notes:—‘*Vyādhān*,’ fowlers,—‘*śākunikān*,’ those who live
by killing birds,—‘*kaivartān*,’ those who live by digging tanks
etc.,—‘*mūlakhātakān*,’ those living by digging up the roots of trees
etc.,—‘*vyālagrahān*,’ serpent-catchers,—‘*uñchavṛttinaḥ*’ those who
live by gleaning corn,—‘*vanagocarān*,’ those who roam about in forests
in search of flowers, fruits and such things.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 209);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 272), which adds that ‘*anyān*’ includes persons whose
business it is to dig up and raise boundary marks;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(111b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 140b).
