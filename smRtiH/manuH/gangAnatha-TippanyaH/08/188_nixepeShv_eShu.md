The second half of this verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 86),
which adds the explanation that if the deposit has been handed over to
the depository *sealed*,—then, unless the latter extracts anything from
it, he shall incur no blame; but if he does extract anything, then he
certainly becomes open to censure. In the case of an unsealed deposition
the other hand, even though he may have extracted something, if he
delivers it before the depositor, he does not incur blame.
