This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 268), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Āvaniṣṭhīvato darpāt*’, through arrogance spitting on
the superior,—‘*avamūtrayataḥ*,’ sprinkling urine,—‘*avaśardhayataḥ*,’
passing wind through the anus with a loud sound;—in *Aparārka* (p. 814),
which takes it as prescribing the penalty for the *Śūdra* doing these
things upon twice-born persons;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p,
288);—in *Mitākṣarā*, (2. 115) where *Bālambhaṭṭī* remarks that the acts
here mentioned are indications of disregard and contempt;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, pp. 75 and 73).
