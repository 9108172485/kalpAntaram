This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 317), which explains
‘*Kulīnānām*’ as ‘born of good families—and ‘*mukhyānām ratnānām*’ as
‘emerald and the like’,—again at p. 324.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.275), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—The reading of the third foot accepted by all is
‘*mukhyānāñcaiva ratnānām*’, and ‘*ratnānāñcaiva sarveṣām*’ is wrong
reading; the meaning is that ‘for stealing persons born of great
families, specially ladies of great families, and also of diamond,
sapphire and other valuable gems, the thief deserves the death-penalty’
in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 344), which says that this clearly refers to
the enticing away of boys and girls of good families, and not of
slaves,—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 134), which explains ‘*mukhya-ratna*’
as standing for the emerald and the rest;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 152a).
