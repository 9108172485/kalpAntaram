This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 680);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.81),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Ajñāna*’ is imperfect knowledge,—and
‘*bāliśya*’, want of experience and knowledge;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra p. 82);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 191), which says—‘If the
witness lies through sexual passion for some woman, he should be fined
2,500 *paṇas*,—if through anger, 2,000 *paṇas*,—if through ignorance,
200 *paṇas*’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37b), which says ‘*triguṇam
param*’ means ‘three times the *middle* amercement’, *i.e*., 1,500
*paṇas*,—*ajñānāt*’, from a wrong idea formed at the time of the
transaction in question,—‘*bāliśya*’ means ‘majority just attained’, a
*minor* not being admissible as a witness.
