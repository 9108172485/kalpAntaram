‘*Jānapada*’—‘Of districts’ (Medhātithi, and Kullūka Govindarāja);—‘of
the inhabitants of one and the same village’ (Nārāyaṇa).

The customs here referred to are those that are not repugnant to the
Scriptures (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 65), which has
the following notes:—‘*Śreṇi-dharma*’ customs established among such
communities as those of the tradesmen and artisans, *e*.*g*., ‘such and
such things are not to be sold on such a day’,—‘*Kuladharma*;’ *e.g*.,
‘in this family the piercing of the ears is to be done in the fifth
year’in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 6b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p.
9b), which has the following notes:—‘*Jātijānapada*’, laws relating to
tribes, castes and to localities,—‘*Śreṇī*’ stands for the corporation
of persons belonging to the same profession,—‘*Svadharma*’, the law
promulgated by the king himself.
