This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 151), which adds the following
explanation:—‘By means of these marks, visible and invisible, as
indicated by his ministers and others, the king should determine the
boundary for those quarrelling over it.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 204), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Satatam upabhuktyā*’, by long unbroken possession—‘he should
determine’, ‘*nayet*’;—‘*udakasyāgamaḥ*’ is flowing current of water;—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 93);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (110b);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 139b).
