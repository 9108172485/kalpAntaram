This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 680), which adds the following
notes:—False evidence is given only through these causes;—‘*lobha*’ is
greed for wealth,—‘*moha*’ is mistake,—‘*ajñāna*’, imperfect
knowledge,—‘*bālabhāva*’ extreme youth;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37a);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 50b).

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 80).
