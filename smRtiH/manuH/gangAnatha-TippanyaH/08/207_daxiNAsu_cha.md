‘*Kārayet*’—‘The sacrificer should have it done by another priest’
(Medhātithi);—‘the defaulting priest should have it done by another
(Nārāyaṇa, Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 837);—in *Paraśāramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 222), which explains ‘*anyena*’ as ‘by some from among
that group of priests to which he himself belongs’;—in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 118);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 49), which says—‘if the priest leaves
his work after, having received the fee after the midday rites, then he
is to return the entire fee, and get the work completed by his son or
others’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (89b).
