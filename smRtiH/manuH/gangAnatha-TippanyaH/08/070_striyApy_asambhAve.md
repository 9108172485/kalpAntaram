This rule refers to the cases contemplated in the preceding verse
(Govindarāja and Kullūka),—‘to the last of these cases only’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 671), which adds that the women
and others mentioned here to be admissible as witnesses should be
understood to be only such as are free from the disqualifications of
being prejudiced or wickedly inclined and so forth.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 214);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 70);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 181);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (32a).
