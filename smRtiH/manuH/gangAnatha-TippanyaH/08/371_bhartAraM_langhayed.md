This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 119);—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 399), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Laṅghayet*’, disregarding her husband, if she goes to another
man,—‘*jñātistrīguṇadarpitā*’, being insolent on account of her
relatives and such feminine qualities as beauty and the like.
