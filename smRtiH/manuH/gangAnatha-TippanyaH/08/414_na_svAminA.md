This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 146), which adds the
following:—Even through the favour of the owner of the Śūdra-slave,
there is no freedom for the latter from the lowest service or slavery.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 786);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (97a),
which explains the meaning as that howsoever favourably inclined he may
be towards either the borne Śūdra or to the bought slave, cannot absolve
him from servitude.
