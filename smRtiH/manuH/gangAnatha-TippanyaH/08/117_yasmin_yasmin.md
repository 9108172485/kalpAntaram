This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.77), to the effect that even
though the case may have been decided, yet if, even subsequently it is
found out that the witnesses had deposed falsely,—the decision should be
upset;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 337);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 65a);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 39b).
