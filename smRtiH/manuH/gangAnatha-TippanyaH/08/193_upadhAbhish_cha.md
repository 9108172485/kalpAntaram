This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 92), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Upadhābhiḥ*,’ by fraud;—‘*sahāya*’ is one who helps
in the misappropriation of other’s property by fraud;—‘*prakāśam*’, in
the public square and such places;—it is quoted again at p. 316;—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 39), which explains ‘*upadhā*’ as
‘fraud’—‘*sahāya*’ as ‘abettor in the fraudulent appropriation,’—and
‘*vadha*’ as ‘beating, imprisonment and so forth’;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (84a).
