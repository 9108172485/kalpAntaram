This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393), which remarks that
‘*daṇḍa*’, ‘punishment,’ meant here is the ‘middle amercement’;—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106);—in *Aparārka* (p. 857), which remarks that
the meaning is that in the case of the Vaiśya having intercourse with an
unguarded Kṣatriya woman who is entirely corrupt, the fine is 500; while
if the woman is guarded and chaste, then death-penalty;—if the woman
belongs to the same cāste as himself, the penalty is the ‘highest
amercement.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.286);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
319), to the effect that between the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, if one has
recourse to the woman of the other caste, the penalty is a fine of 1,000
and 500 *paṇas* respectively;—and in *Vīramitrodya* (Vyavahāra 156a).
