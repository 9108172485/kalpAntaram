This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāratattva* (p. 26);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(27a), which says that ‘*samakṣadarśana*’ and ‘*śravaṇa*’ stand for all
forms of valid knowledge, hence the meaning is that that man is a
*witness* who possesses a right knowledge of the subject-matter of the
enquiry;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 44b).
