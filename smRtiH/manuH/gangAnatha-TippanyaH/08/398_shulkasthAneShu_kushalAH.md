‘*Tataḥ*’—‘Of the amount thus fixed’ (Medhātithi);—‘out of the profit on
that amount’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 304), which remarks that
this refers to commodity. imported from other countries;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 833);—in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 164), which adds that,
though from the words it would seem that the twentieth part of the value
of the commodity is meant, yet, in fact, it is of the profit over and
above the value fixed; for if the king were to take the twentieth part
of the value, then the trader would have no profit at all, and his
business would be ruined;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (p. 954.)
