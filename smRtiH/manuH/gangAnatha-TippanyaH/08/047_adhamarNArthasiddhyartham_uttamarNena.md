This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 76), which adds the
following explanation;—‘when the debtor has received something,—and the
creditor approaches the king for the recovery of that, then the king
should have the creditor’s dues paid to him by the debtor;—if it is
*adhamarṇavibhāvitam*, that is, if it is proved by the creditor that the
amount claimed is really due from the debtor’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(80b).

The clear meaning, specially in view of verse 51, appears to be ‘if the
debt is *admitted by the debtor*.’
