This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 191), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Yasmin yasmin*’, the repetition of this general
pronoun implies that even in transactions other than sales,—such as loan
and so forth,—if there is ‘desire to withdraw’ or ‘repentance’, the same
rules are to be followed as those laid down in connection with the
Rescission of Sales,—such as returning, receiving back, fine of 600
*paṇas* and so forth, in accordance with the circumstances of each case;
‘*anena*,’ *i.e*., by the method Laid down in connection with the
Rescission of Sales and Purchases;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 88);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (108b).
