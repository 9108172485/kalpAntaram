This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 162), which
explains ‘*Yoga*’ as ‘obtain another’s property, without any right to
it, by means of begging and such other means’,—‘*ādhamana*’ as
‘pledge’;—and the compound ‘*Yogādhamanam*’ as ‘*Yoge ādhamanam*’,
‘pledging of what does not rightly belong to one.’

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 90), which explains ‘*Yoga*’ as
‘fraud’; and adds that the king shall nullify every transaction in
connection with which he detects some fraud;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (65b)
which explains ‘*upadhī*’ as *fraud*,—‘*yogā*’ as ‘deceit’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 39b), which has the following
notes:—‘*Ādhamana*’ is pledge,—‘*yoga*’ is deceit,—‘*upādhi*’ is
fraud;—and adds that all fraudulent transactions are null and void.
