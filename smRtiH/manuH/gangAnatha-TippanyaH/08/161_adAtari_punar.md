This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 43), which takes it as
putting the question which is answered in the next verse. It adds the
following notes:—‘*Adā tari*’, *i.e*., a surety other than the one for
payment (*i.e*., the surety for appearance and the surety for
trust),—being ‘*vijñātoprakṛti*’—*i*.*e*., being known to have stood
surety after having received something in pledge from the debtor; and
thus having its character fully known;—if such a surety dies ,—‘*kena
hetunā*’—by what means—is the ‘*dātā*’—the man who advanced the loan,
the creditor,—to receive back the debt? The work goes on to quote
Halāyudha as explaining the term ‘*vijñatoprakṛti*’as ‘being known that
he became the *lagnaka* (?) on receiving a *pledge*’, and regarding the
verse as denying the creditor’s right to receive payment from the
surety’s heirs on his death. But remarks that the net result of both
explanations is the same.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (74a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Adātari*’, a surety other than *Dānapratibhū*,—‘*dātā*’, the
creditor,—‘*vijñātoprakṛti*’, one whose solvency is well known.
