This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 201), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Nayet*’, ‘should find out’;—‘*setu*’ here stands for
any mark of boundary,—where these are ‘*saprakāśa*,’ *i*. *e*., quite
perceptible by reason of water having dried up;—the word ‘*Jyaiṣṭha*’
also should be taken as standing for any time which makes it possible
for the boundary-marks to be perceived.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 758), which adds the following notes:—The
term ‘*grāma*’ should be taken including cities, fields and houses in
regard to which boundary-disputes arise, so that boundary-disputes fall
into these four classes;—when the text mentions the month of
‘*Jyeṣṭha*’, it does not mean that it must be done during that month;
all that it means to imply is *convenience*, that month being the most
convenient for the purpose of determining boundaries;—‘*setu*’ stands
for bunds and other boundary-marks;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 92);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 142a), which says that the month of,
‘*Jyeṣṭha*’ is mentioned only by way of illustration; all that is meant
is that it shall be done at a time when the boundary-marks may be
perceptible,—and that ‘*grāma*’ stands for *city* also.
