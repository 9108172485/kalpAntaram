This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 253), which explains
‘*svāni karmāṇi*’ as ‘duties prescribed for their respective castes’;—in
*Aparārka* (p. 789);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 126a), which
says that the meaning is that ‘if a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya has become a
slave through want of living, his master should treat him well and take
light work from him.’
