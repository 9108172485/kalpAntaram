This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.26), as laying down the forms of
‘death,’ which means ‘corporal punishment;’ *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that
‘*vrajet*’ means ‘should go away from home or from the city’;—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 630), which explains ‘*akṣataḥ*’ as ‘without
corporal suffering’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 293), as laying
down the spots of the body where corporal punishment is to be inflicted
upon all offenders, except the Brāhmaṇa;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 399 and Vyavahāra, p. 155), as laying down the ten forms of
corporal punishment.
