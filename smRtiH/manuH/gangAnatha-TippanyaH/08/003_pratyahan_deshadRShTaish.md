‘*Vināpi sākṣibhiḥ etc*.’—(Medhātithi, p. 793, l. 24)—This is a clear
reference to Yājñavalkya (Vyavahāra, 89).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 18), and again
on p. 31, in support of the view that the king shall decide cases
relating to all the eighteen points of dispute, on the basis of local
customs and also of ordeals and other methods prescribed by the
scriptures;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 2a);—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 57);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (3a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Deśadṛṣṭa hetu*’ are those special means of coming to a
decision which are effective in the place concerned,—of the custom
obtaining among the people of the North and those of the Central land,
of feeding the person who comes to ask for the hand of a girl, which
*feeding* means a distinct promise to marry the girl,—‘*śāstradṛṣṭa
hetu*’ stands for *witnesses and the rest*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, p. 4a).
