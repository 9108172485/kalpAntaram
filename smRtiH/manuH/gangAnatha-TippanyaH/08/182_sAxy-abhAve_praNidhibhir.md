**(verses 8.181-182)**

These verses are quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 94), which explains them to mean that—‘If the person who calls
himself the Depositor demands the deposit from the person called the
Deposit-holder,—and the latter denies it, saying ‘nothing was deposited
with me’,—and there are no witnesses to the transaction;—then the king,
with a desire to ascertain the facts, should have recourse to the
following stratagem:—Through spies of the proper age and appearance,
trustworthy in word and appearance, he should by some pretext deposit
his own gold with the accusal person;—after some days, he should have
that deposit demanded from him.
