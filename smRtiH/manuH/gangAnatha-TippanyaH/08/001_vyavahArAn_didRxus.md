This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 600), which explains
‘*mantrajñaḥ*’ as ‘*arthaśāstrajñaḥ*’, ‘learned in the Science of
Polity’, and deduces the sense that the person who tries cases should
act up to the principles of the Science of Polity, in so far as they are
not incompatible with the Dharmaśāstra, the Ethical Science.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 18), to the effect that
having entered the court, the king shall carry on the work, in
association with learned men and with councillors;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha*
(page 2) in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 1b):—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(3a), which has. the following notes—‘*Vyavahārān*’, points of dispute
between the plaintiff and the defendant,—‘*didṛkṣuḥ*’, with a view to
determine,—‘*pṛthivīpatiḥ*,’ includes *non-Kṣatriyas*
also,—‘*mantrajñaiḥ*’, persons conversant with the method of doing
business in due accordance with the exigencies of time and place,—this
qualifies ‘*brāhmaṇaiḥ*’, ignorant Brāhmaṇas being prone to give hasty
advice and thereby create trouble,—‘*mantribhiḥ*’ stands for experienced
councillors;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 4a).
