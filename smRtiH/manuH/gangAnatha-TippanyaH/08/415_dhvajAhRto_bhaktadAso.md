*Cf*. 8.49, 177 and 9.229.

‘*Dhvajāhṛtaḥ*’—‘Captured in war’ (Medhātithi);—‘who has become a slave
by marrying a slave-girl’ (Nārāyaṇa).

‘*Daṇḍadāsaḥ*’—‘Enslaved for debt’ (Medhātithi);—‘enslaved for having
abandoned a religious order’. (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 789), which explains
‘*daṇḍadāsa*’ as ‘one who has been enslaved in payment of fine imposed,’
and adds that the list here given is not meant to be exhaustive.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.181), which remarks that the list is not
exhaustive; and *Bālambhaṭṭī* explains ‘*dhvajadāsa*’ as ‘a captive of
war,’—‘*daṇḍadāsa*’ as ‘one who has abandoned a religious order and has
not performed the consequent expiatory rite, and has thereupon, by way
of punishment, been made by the king a life-long slave.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 240), which also notes
that the list is not exhaustive.
