title = "172 स्वादानाद् वर्णसंसर्गात्"

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 275), which adds
the following notes;—‘*Svādānāt*’, ‘by taking what is his own legally,
such as taxes and so forth’;—‘*varṇasaṃsargāt*’, ‘by marriages and such
relationships contracted by the Brāhmaṇa’ and other castes with persons
of their own respective castes’; the ‘*saṃsarga*’ of different castes is
not meant, as that would lead to the evil of ‘mixed castes.’
