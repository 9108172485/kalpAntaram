This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 823), which adds the following
notes:—The washerman shall not carry clothes tying them in
cloth;—‘*navāsayet*,’ nor should he keep them in his house, or he should
not allow them to be used by others on receiving cash-hire from them.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.238), which adds the following
explanation:—The washerman shall wash clothes by rinsing them on a plank
of cotton-wood, and not on stone; he shall not mix them up, *i.e*.,
shall not exchange them among the diverse owners, says
*Bālambhaṭṭī*,—nor shall he keep them in his house;—if he does any of
these things, he should be punished.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 313), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Śālmale*,’ made of cotton-wood,—‘*ślakṣṇe*,’
soft,—‘*nirṇijyāt*,’ should wash,—‘*nejakaḥ*,’ washerman,—‘*nacha
vāsāṃsi vāsobhirnirharet*,’ he should not carry clothes tied up in other
clothes, to the washing-place,—‘*na ca vāsayet*,’ he should not let the
clothes of one person be worn by another. The meaning is that if he does
not act up to these rules, he becomes liable to punishment.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 311), as laying down
rules for washermen.
