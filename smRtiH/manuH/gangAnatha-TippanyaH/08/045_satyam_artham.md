‘*Artham*’—The value of the suit and the motive behind it’
(Medhātithi);—‘such suit as deals with things of value, like cattle,
gold and the like’ (Kullūka);—‘money realisable by fine’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘the aim’ (Nandana).

‘*Ātmānam sākśiṇam*’—‘Looking upon himself as the witness’; or ‘looking
upon his own position, and that of the witness adduced’
(Medhātithi);—Kullūka and others have the latter explanation only.

^(‘)*Deśam kālam*’—‘Considerations of the place and time of the offence
committed’ (Medhātithi and Rāghavānanda); ‘what is befitting the time
and place’ (Kullūka);—‘customs of the country and what is befitting the
time’ (Nārāyaṇa); ‘place of offence and age of the offender’
(Govindarāja); ‘Heavy and continued residence there’ (‘others’ in
Medhātithi).

‘*Rūpam*’—‘Aspect of the case’ (Medhātithi, Kullūka and Nandana);—‘looks
of the parties’ (Narāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘beauty of the celestial
damsels’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi),

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (p. 5a), which has the
following notes:—‘*Satyam paśyet*’, the meaning is that even though the
statements of the two parties are not clear enough to justify a
decision, yet if, by inference and other means, the king is able to form
some decision, he should fix upon that;—‘*artham*’, gold, cattle and
other kinds of property;—‘*ātmānam*’, he should look upon himself as
participating in the effects of the trial;—‘*rūpam*’, form of the object
in dispute, *i.e*., its importance or otherwise.
