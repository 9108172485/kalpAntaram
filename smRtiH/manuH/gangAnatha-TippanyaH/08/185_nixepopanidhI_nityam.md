This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 87), which adds the
following explanation:—If the depositor is living, deposits, sealed or
open, should never be given by the depository to any such near relative
of the depositor as may have a share in the property,—during the absence
of the depositor himself; for if the said relative happen to die, the
deposits become lost, *i.e*., they do not reach the depositor himself;
though if the relative does not die, they may perhaps reach him. So that
in the event of the relative’s death, it would be open to the original
depositor to demand from the depository the value of the deposits; and
in order to guard against this, the depository should always return the
deposits to the depositor himself, while he lives.

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (83a).
