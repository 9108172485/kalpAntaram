‘*Kapiñjalaiḥ*’ (Medhātithi, p. 937, l. 11)—This refers to a case dealt
with in Mīmāṃsā-sūtra, where it is said that whenever the plural number
is used, we should understand it to mean *three*; for instance, when
‘Kapiñjala birds’ are spoken of as to be sacrificed. Medhātithi says
that this principle should not be applied to the present case of the
plural in ‘*Charrubhiḥ*’.

Nandana does not read the verse differently as asserted by Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 682), which adds that the plural
number in ‘*Carubhiḥ*’ is due to the plurality of the persons referred
to here—‘*te*’, ‘*they*’;—in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 432), which says
that this refers to the three higher castes only.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 390);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 355), which adds that ‘*Vāgdevatā*’ here must be
taken as standing for *Sarasvatī*, the terms ‘*Vāk*’ and ‘*Sarasvatī*’
being synonymous, specially as it is only thus that the offering shall
be consistent with its name ‘*Sacrifice to Sarasvatī*’; it proceeds to
add that the pronoun ‘*te*’ here stands for those witnesses who tell a
lie for saving a Brāhmaṇa or a Kṣatriya from death;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 207); and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (38b).
