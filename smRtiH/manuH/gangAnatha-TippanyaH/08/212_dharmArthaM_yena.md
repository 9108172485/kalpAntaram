‘*Kartāhametat karmeti*’—(Medhātithi, p. 1009, l. 5).—The text of Nārada
(4.10-11) is—‘*Kartāhametat karmeti pratilābhecchayā ca yat Apātre
pātramityukte kārye vā dharmasaṃhite Yaddattam syādavijñānādadattam
tadapi smṛtam*.’

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 137), which explains the
meaning to be—‘If the man begs money for the performance of a pious act,
but having got it, he does not do the act, then the gift should be
recovered from him.’

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 348), to the effect that when
money has been given to a Brāhmaṇa who has begged it for the purpose of
performing a sacrifice or some such act,—but he does not do such an
act,—then the money is to be taken back from him;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (94a).
