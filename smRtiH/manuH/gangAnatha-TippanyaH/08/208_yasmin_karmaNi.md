This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 119) which adds the
following notes:—‘*Praiyaṃśadakṣiṇāḥ*’ (which is its reading for
‘*pratyaṅgadakṣināḥ*’), the fees that have been prescribed for a
particular priest, in connection with particular sections of an
elaborate sacrifice; *e.g*., at the ceremony of anointment two golden
vessels are given to the *Adhvaryu* priest;—in regard to these, the
question is—Is the whole of that special fee to be taken by that one
priest in reference to whom it has been prescribed? Or that individual
is only the formal recipient, and the fee has to be equally divided
among all the priests taking part in the performance?

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalapataru* (90a), which explains
‘*pratyaṃśadakṣiṇā*’ (which is its reading for ‘*pratyaṅgadakṣiṇā*’) as
‘the fees that have been prescribed as the special shares of particular
priests’, and it adds that this rule is meant to raise the question
whether when, *e.g*., two gold Prakāśas are prescribed as to be given at
the *Abhiṣecanīya Rites, to the Adhvaryu*,—are the two articles to be
taken by that priest, or are they to be divided among all the priests
concerned?
