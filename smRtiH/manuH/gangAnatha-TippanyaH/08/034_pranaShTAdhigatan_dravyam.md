This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 347), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Praṇaṣṭādhigatam*’, ‘was first lost and then
recovered’;—‘*yuktaiḥ*’, ‘carefully devoted to guarding the
property—‘*ibhena*’, ‘by means of an elephant’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(p. 149). which notes that the ‘guarding’ is to be done by the king’s
officers, and explains ‘*ibhena*’ as ‘by an elephant’.
