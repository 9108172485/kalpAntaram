This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitāttva* (II, p. 199), to the effect that
the court becomes a true ‘Court,’ only by reason of the presence of the
duly qualified Brāhmaṇa-judge appointed by the king;—in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Vyavahāra, p. 46), which explains ‘*prakṛtaḥ*’ as the *appointed*
judge;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (8b);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 36 and
11b), which says that no stress is meant to be laid upon the number
*three*, as the number may be larger, up to seven; what is meant is that
they shall not be less than three;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 17a).
