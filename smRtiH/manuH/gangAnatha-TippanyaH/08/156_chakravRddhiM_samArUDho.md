‘*Cakarvṛddhi*’;—‘Interest on wheeled carriage’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘compound interest’ (Nārāyaṇa as
also ‘others’ in Medhātithi on verse 157).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 73), which gives a totally
different explanation:—‘*Deśakālavyavosthitaḥ cakravṛddhim samārūḍhaḥ*’
means ‘having entered into an agreement regarding *cakravṛddhi*’ to the
effect that “at such and such a place and time I shall take döuble this
amount,”—if the creditor asks for repayment of his dues with compound
interest, before the stipulated time, or at a place other than the
stipulated one, then he shall not receive his dues with compound
interest;’—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (80a), which explains ‘*samārūḍha*’ as
‘stipulated, agreed upon,’ and ‘*tatphalam*’ as *the effect of the
cakravṛddhi*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 104a).
