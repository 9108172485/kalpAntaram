This verse is qüoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 391);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 291), which adds that the father and
mother must be exceptions to this rule, as is clear from the following
Smṛti-text quoted by *Vijñāneśvara*:—‘The following are
unpunishable—Father, Mother, Accomplished Student, Priest, Wandering
Mendicant, Anchorite, &c.’ Similarly the ‘very learned man’ should not
be punished.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 628).
