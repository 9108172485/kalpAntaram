‘*Alandhanaḥ*’—Qualifies the surety (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and
Nārāyaṇa);—it qualifies the surety’s heir (Rāghavānanda);—Nandana reads
‘*alakṣitaḥ*’ and explains it as ‘if the surety who received the money
is not found.’

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 48), as providing the
answer to the question put in the preceding verse. It adds the following
explanation:—If the surety, to whom money had been handed over
(*nirādiṣṭa*) by the debtor, is ‘*alandhanaḥ*’,—*i.e*., he has really
got the money,—then, on his death, the ‘*nirādiṣṭaḥ*’—*i.e*., the *son*
of the surety to whom money had been handed over—should pay the debt out
of his own property. The term ‘*nirādiṣṭaḥ*’ is applied figuratively to
the *son*.

It is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (74a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Nirādiṣṭadhana*’, is the surety to whom enough money had been
handed over by the creditor, to cover the amount of surety
involved,—‘*alandhanaḥ*’, possessed of sufficient property,—the second
‘*nirādiṣṭa*’ stands for the son of the person who had stood surety and
has since died; the meaning being that the son should make good the debt
for which his father had stood surety.
