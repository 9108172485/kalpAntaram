This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.147), in support of the view
that except the husband, no co-parcener should lay hands upon the
property of women during their life-time;—in *Aparārka* (p. 752), to the
effect that when the woman is *dead*, her relations do have a right to
her *Strīdhana* property;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 512); and in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 70).
