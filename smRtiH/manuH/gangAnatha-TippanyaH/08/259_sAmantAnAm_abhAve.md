This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 209), which explains
‘*maulāḥ*’ as ‘persons who have lived in the village ever since it came
into existence,’—and ‘*anuyuñjīta*’ as ‘should question’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyvahāra, p. 272);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
790);—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (111b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
140b), which says that the foresters and others are to be asked only
when there are no such persons available as are cultivators of lands
lying near the disputed boundary.
