‘*Samyatām*’—‘Kept away from amusements and guarded by chamberlains’
\[not ‘relatives’ as stated by Buhler\] (Medhātithi);—‘bound’
(Nārāyaṇa). Kullūka is misrepresented by Buhler: he says nothing about
‘fettering’; he only says that she is to be kept in the house ‘with
care’.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 404), which explains
‘*Sāvamānām*’ as ‘winning him over to herself for the purposes of sexual
intercourse’,—and ‘*samyatām*’ as ‘imprisoned.’
