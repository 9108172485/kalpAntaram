“According to Nārāyaṇa, the verse refers to cases where one believes a
deposit to be with another but has not made it over himself; according
to Govindarāja and Kullūka, to cases where there may be error.
Govindarāja and Kullūka think that the person who should act in the
manner described is the king, and they explain ‘*anvicchet* by ‘he
should decide.’ Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda, on the other hand, think that
the depositor should act thus.”—Buhler.

This verse has been omitted entirely by Medhātithi; neither the verse
nor its commentary is found in the Mss.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 94), according to which
the verse refers to what the depositors should do; it means that ‘the
depository should keep the deposit honestly and lovingly; all the more
so if the depositor is found to be a man of thoroughly good character.’

It is also quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 209), which says
that this lays down what should be done by the successor of the
depositor, if the depository does not of his own accord, surrender the
deposit, after the depositor’s death.
