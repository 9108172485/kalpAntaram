‘*Vrātyā*’—‘(*a*) A public woman, or (*b*) a woman who belongs, as
slave, to several men, or (*c*) ‘unmarried’ (the last being rejected)
(Medhātithi who is misrepresented by Buhler);—‘the wife of a person,
who, though of a twice-born caste, has not had his sacraments’
(Govindarāja 'and Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 394), which adds the
following explanatory notes:—If a man is found to persist in the
intercourse for one year, after having been convicted of it,—he should
suffer double the penalty prescribed for the first offence of its kind;
and the penalty should be enhanced in proportion to the period of
duration of the connection. ‘*Vrātyā*’ is the woman fallen from virtue,
who has abandoned all meritorious acts; but Halāyudha explains
‘*vrātyā*’ as a maiden that has passed her marriageable age.
