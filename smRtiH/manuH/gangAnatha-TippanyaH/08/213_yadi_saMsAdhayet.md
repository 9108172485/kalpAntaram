‘*Saṃsādhayet*’—‘If he tries to enforce the fulfilment of the promise by
a complaint before the king’ (Medhātithi);—if he tries to obtain the
money forcibly or refuses to refund it’ (Kullūka, Rāghavānanda and
Govindarāja);—‘if he should withhold the repayment’ (Rāmacandra, who
reads ‘*Sandhārayet*’);—‘if the man should really perform the act for
which he had begged, then the man who had promised to pay, but did not
pay, (or having paid, took it back), should be made to pay to him a
*Suvarṇa*, by way of fine, for not fulfilling his promise’ (Nandana, who
has been misrepresented by Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 137), which explains the
meaning to be—‘if, through annoyance or greed, he should accomplish the
purpose (*artham sādhayet*), then he should be fined by the king one
*Suvarṇa*.’

It is quoted also in *Aparārka* (p. 782), which adds the following
explanation:—‘If on being asked to refund, the man, through annoyance or
greed, does not refund the money, but complain before the king with a
view to establish the fact that the gift should not be taken back,—then
he should be forced to refund the money’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (94a).
