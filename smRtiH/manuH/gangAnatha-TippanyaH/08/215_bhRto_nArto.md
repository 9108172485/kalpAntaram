‘*Kṛṣṇala*’—‘Of gold, silver or copper, according to the nature of the
case’ (Medhātithi and Govindarāja); Kullūka also has ‘*suvarṇādi*’,
‘gold and others’, and *not* ‘gold’ only. Buhler has misrepresented him.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*’ (2.198);—in ‘*Vyavahāramayūkha*’
(p. 92);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 233), which notes that this
is meant for a case where the hired man has left the work half undone;
if he has done more than half, then only the wages have to be withheld
(and there is to be no fine);—in *Aparārka* (p. 797), which notes that
he should not receive the wages of even that part of the work which he
may have done and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (102a), which explains ‘*anārtaḥ*’
as not suffering from any disability imposed either by royal command or
by supernatural causes.
