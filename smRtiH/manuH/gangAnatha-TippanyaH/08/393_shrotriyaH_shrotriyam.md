‘*Śrotriyam*’—‘Who is *not* a neighbour’ (Medhātithi);—‘a neighbour’
(Govindarāja, and Kullūka);—‘a resident of the same village’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 359), which adds the
explanation that the quantity of food that he might have eaten should be
made to be given to the uninvited man.
