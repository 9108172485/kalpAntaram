This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.155), according to which
*ajñānāt* is meant to cover those cases where a man takes possession of
another’s garden &c. under the impression that they really belong to
himself; in which case the fine is to be only two hundred. *Bālambhaṭṭī*
has the following notes:—‘*Bhīṣayā*,’ threatening with dangers from some
other source; this includes *greed* also.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 766);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 222),
which explains ‘*bhīṣayā*,’ as ‘by arousing fear in him,’—‘*ajñānāt*’ as
‘through mistake’;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 98);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(Calcutta, p. 64), which explains that ‘if one robs the house after
having threatened the owner, the fine is only 500 *paṇas*;’—and in
*Vīramitrodaya*, (Vyavahāra, 143b).
