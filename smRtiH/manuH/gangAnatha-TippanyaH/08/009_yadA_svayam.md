This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 21), which adds
that the Brāhmaṇa so appointed is called the ‘*Prāḍvivāka*,’ ‘judge,’
who is to try the suits exactly in the same manner as has been laid down
for the king; It adds a text from Nārada explaining the name
‘*Prāḍvivāka*—‘The *Prāḍvivāka* is so called because *he puts questions*
(prāṭ) upon the subject-matter of the suit and *investigates* *it*
(Vivāka).—It is quoted also in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 36);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (8a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 10b).
