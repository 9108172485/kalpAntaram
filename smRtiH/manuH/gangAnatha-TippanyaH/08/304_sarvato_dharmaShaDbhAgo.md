“This is that famous ‘sixth’ of good or evil which the king draws upon
himself by protecting or neglecting his people; he revives a sixth of
the produce as tax (7.130), and in return, it may be, must give security
to the realm, or he gets the same proportion of the fruits of their bad
deeds; or (*cf*. verse 308) he takes all the sin of the world.
Yājñavalkya says (1.334-336) he takes one-sixth of the fruit of their
good deeds, but one half of their sin in case he does not protect them.
Similarly the sixth or the twelfth part (8. 35), or half (8.39) is the
share of the treasure the king receives; and again in 8.18 he receives a
fourth of the fruits of the sin caused by a wrong decision in
court.”—Hopkins, who refers to the Mahābhārata (13.61.34-35), where, in
regard to the sin, different views (fourth part, half, whole) are set
forth and then the conclusion stated in favour of the *fourth* part,
which, it is said, is in accordance with the ‘teaching of Manu.’

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 397);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 255);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (p. 73p);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263).
