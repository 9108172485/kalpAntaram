This verse is quoted in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 432), which says that
this is to be regarded as mere *arthavāda*, as expiatory rites are
prescribed for this lying also;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 207),
as an exception to the general rule regarding deposing truthfully;—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (38a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, p. 58a),
which explains that this verse makes *silence*, or even *lying*, better
than telling the truth, under the circumstances.
