This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.300), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds
the following notes:—‘*Kṣūdra-paśu*’ are smaller animals,—these
*smaller* ones being either in *age*, *e.g*., calves &c., or in
*quality*, *e.g*., goats &c.; but it is the former that are meant here;
so that for the killing of a young calf the fine would be 200; in the
case of birds that are auspicious—in shape or in quality,—‘*mṛga*,’ the
*ruru*, the *pṛṣata* and other species of the deer,—birds, such as the
parrot, the swan and so forth,—the fine is 50.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 283), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Kṣudra*’ means *small*; and ‘smallness’ is of two kinds—due to
age, as in the case of the elephant cub, and due to quality, as in the
case of the goat and the like; the ‘*śubha mṛga*’ are the *Ruru*, the
*Pṛṣata* and so forth; and ‘*śubha*’ birds are the parrot and the like.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 109);—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 291).
