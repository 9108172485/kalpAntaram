This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.73), which adds the following
notes:—To the Brāhmaṇa he should administer the oath—‘If you tell a lie
your truthfulness shall perish’; to the Kṣatriya, ‘your conveyances and
weapons shall be futile’; to the Vaiśya, ‘your cattle, seeds and gold
shall be useless;’ to the Śūdra, ‘if you tell a lie all the sins shall
accrue to thee.’ It adds that verse 102 provides an exception to the
rule here laid down.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 19), and again on p. 38;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 78);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 611),
which adds the following notes:—The Brāhmaṇa he shall cause to take the
oath in the form ‘what I say is quite *true*,’ and what he says after
this should be accepted as true;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 336);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (62a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 88b).
