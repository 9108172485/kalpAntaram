title = "142 द्विकन् त्रिकम्"

This rule is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 8), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Dvikam*’ means ‘that in which two *Purāṇas* per month
are charged’; so with ‘*trika*’ and the other terms.—From the Brāhmaṇa,
Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and Śūdra, one should charge an interest of two, three,
four and five *Purāṇas* respectively, for every hundred of the debt;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 320);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (67b).
