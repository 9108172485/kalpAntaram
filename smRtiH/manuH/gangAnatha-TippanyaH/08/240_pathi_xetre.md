‘*Vārayet*’—Rāmacandra reads ‘*cārayet*’ and takes the whole verse as a
single sentence—‘If the cattle-keeper *takes the cattle to graze* in a
field that is fenced, he shall be fined along with his master.’

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 232), which reads
‘*cārayet*’ for ‘*vārayet* it explains the meaning of the verse to
be—‘The field on the road-side or on village precincts being duly
fenced, if its crops are eaten (this clause is to be added), then the
keeper of the cattle is to be fined one hundred (*paṇas*), and the stray
cattle is to he caught and tied up.’

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 266), which adds the
following notes:—When a field on the road-side has been duly fenced, if
cattle break through the fence and destroy the crops, the keeper of the
cattle is to be filled a hundred *paṇas*; similarly when a field on the
precincts of a village has been duly fenced, if cattle break into it and
eat the crops, the keeper is to be fined a hundred *paṇas*. This
indicates that there is to be no punishment if the field is unfenced.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 771), which explains the meaning to be
that when the field on the road-side and other such places has been duly
fenced, if it is damaged by cattle which is attended by their keeper,
then the keeper is to be fined one hundred; but if the cattle is
unattended it shall be driven off;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
137b), which explains ‘*pathi kṣetre*’ a s ‘in a field close by the
path,’—and ‘*grāmāntīye*’ as ‘lying on the outskirts of the village.’
