‘*Antyajastriyam*’—‘Chāṇḍāla woman’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka
and Rāghavānanda);—‘woman belonging to such castes as washermen,
cobblers, actors, basket-makers, fishermen, *Mādas* and *Bhillas*’
(Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 394), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kṣatriyavaiśye*’ is the dual form in the
Accusative;—‘*antyajastrī*’, washerwoman and the like;—in view of what
is said here the death-penalty laid down elsewhere for having recourse
to the ‘*antyaja*’ woman should be understood as meant for men other
than Brāhmaṇas;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1008);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 108), which explains ‘*antyaja*’ as ‘the
washerwoman, the cobbler, and so forth.’
