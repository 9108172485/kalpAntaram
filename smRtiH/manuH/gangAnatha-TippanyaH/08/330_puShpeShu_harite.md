‘*Anyeṣu*’—Medhātithi does not read ‘*alpeṣu*’ as asserted by Hopkins.

‘*Pañcakṛṣṇalaḥ*’—‘Medhātithi says that the *kṛṣṇalas* meant may be gold
or silver, in accordance with the gravity of the offence’—that ‘it is
meant to be *gold* only’ is the view that he quotes as held by the
‘ancients.’ Buhler therefore is not right in attributing this latter
view to Medhātithi himself.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 325) which adds the
following notes:—‘*Harite dhānye*’, which is still lying unripe in the
field; on this being stolen for purposes of fodder ,—‘ *naga*’,
tree,—‘*alpeṣu*’ (which is its reading for ‘*anyeṣu*’), quantity even
less than what can be carried by a man,—‘*aparipūteṣu*’,
unhusked,—‘*dhānye*’, in construing the sentence the number is to be
changed into the plural, ‘*dhānyeṣu*.’
