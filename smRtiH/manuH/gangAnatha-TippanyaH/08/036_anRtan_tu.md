title = "036 अनृतन् तु"

The amount of the fine depends on the circumstances of the case and the
virtues of the offender (Medhātithi),—or only on the virtues of the
offender (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 641);—and the
whole verse in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 642), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Alpīyasīm kalām*’ implies that'the fine is to be imposed in
such a manner that the entire treasure may not become absorbed,—this
being meant for those cases where the exact extent of the
entire-property is not known.
