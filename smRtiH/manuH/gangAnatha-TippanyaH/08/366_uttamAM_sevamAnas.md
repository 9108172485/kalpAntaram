This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 402), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Uttamām*’ has to be qualified by ‘if
willing’;—‘*samām*,’ belonging to the same caste as himself;—‘*śulkam*’,
fee agreed upon by both the parties, as in the ‘Āsura’ form of marriage.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321), to the effect
that when a man of the lower caste has intercourse with a maiden of a
higher caste, whether willing or unwilling, his penalty is death, but
when one has intercourse with a willing maiden of the same caste as
himself, then he shall present to her father a cow and a bull, if the
latter be willing to accept it (and the man has to marry the maiden in
this case, adds *Bālambhaṭṭī*); but if the father is not willing to
receive the fee, its equivalent shall be paid as fine to the king (and
in this case also the maiden is to be married to the man).

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
