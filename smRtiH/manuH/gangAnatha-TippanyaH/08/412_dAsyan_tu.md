This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 153), which has the
following notes:—‘*Prabhāvatvāt*’ (which is its reading for
‘*Prābhavatyāt*’), on account of being powerful,—‘*saṃskṛtān*,’ endowed
with character and learning if a Brāhmaṇa employs such twice-born men in
work unsuitable for them he should be fined 600 by the king.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 789), which explains ‘*prābhavatya*,’ as
‘*prabhavato bhāvaḥ*,’ *being powerful*;—600 *paṇas* are meant;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 126a), which explains ‘*prābhavatyāt*’ as
‘*prabhutvāt*’, and adds that the mention of ‘*dvijāti*’ makes it clear
that the penalty here prescribed does not refer to the case of *Śūdra*
-slaves.
