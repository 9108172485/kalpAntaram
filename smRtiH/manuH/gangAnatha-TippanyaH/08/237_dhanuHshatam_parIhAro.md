This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 774), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Śaṃyā*’ is the piece of wood which serves as the bolt keeping
the bullock fixed to the yoke,—and the distance covered by the tin-owing
of tins piece of wood is what is called ‘*Śamyāpāta*.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 231), which, reading
‘*Saṃyāpātāḥ*’ (in place of ‘*Śaṃyāpātāḥ*’) notes that the ‘*Sami*’ is a
wooden bolt, and three times the distance covered by the throwing of it
should be the extent of the pasture-land round the village, and three
times this should be the pasture-land surrounding a city.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 96), which explains ‘*parīhāra*’
as ‘land reserved for the grazing of cattle—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 817).
