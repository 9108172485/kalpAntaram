‘*Brāhmaṇabruvaḥ*’—‘One whose origin is doubtful, but who calls himself
a *Brāhmaṇa*’ (’Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘despicable Brāhmaṇa’
(Medhātithi and Govindarāja);—‘an initiated Brāhmaṇa who does not study
the Veda’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 601);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 22);—in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 200), which supplies the
definition of ‘*brāhmaṇabruvaḥ*’ as ‘the Brāhmaṇa who neither studies
nor teaches (the Veda)—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (9a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, p. 11a).
