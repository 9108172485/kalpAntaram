This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 773):—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
175), which notes that ‘goats and sheep’ stand for all such animals as
are liable to be attacked by wolves; and explains ‘*Samruddhe*’ as
*attacked*;—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 265), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Anāyati*’, not coming to ward off the
attack,—‘*yām*’, animal belonging to the category of ‘goats and
sheep—this pertains to cases where the attack takes place in easily
accessible places; in the case of its coming in a place which is
inaccessible, no blame attaches to the keeper;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(105b);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 137a), which explains
‘*anāyati*’ as ‘if he does not come to avert the danger.’
