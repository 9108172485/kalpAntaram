The first half of this verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 57),
which adds that ‘*darśanaprātibhāvya*’ includes the surety for *trust*
also \[this is clear from Yājñavalkya, 254, where both are put on the
same footing\]—the second half is quoted on p. 43 where ‘*dānapratibhū*’
is explained as ‘the surety who had promised *I* *shall pay*,’—and
‘*dāyādān*’ as ‘sons.’

\(1\) ‘*Darśana-pratibhū*’ is the person standing surety with the
promise ‘I shall produce this man when required’;—(2) *Pratyayapratibhū*
is one who says ‘give him the loan on my trust’;—(3) *Dānapratibhū*’—who
says ‘give him the loan, which, if he does not pay, I shall pay.’

The verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (74a and 76b).
