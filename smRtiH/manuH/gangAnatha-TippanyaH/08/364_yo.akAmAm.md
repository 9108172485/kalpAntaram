This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 401), which explains
‘*akāmām*’ as ‘unwilling,’—and ‘*tulyaḥ*’ as a ‘man belonging to a caste
intercourse with which is lawful.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 858), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Akāmām*,’ ‘unwilling’—‘*konyām*,’ ‘unmarried girl who retains
her virginity’—if one violates,—he, whether he be of the same caste as
the maiden, or of a different caste, deserves death, *if he is not a
Brāhmaṇa*; if he is a Brāhmaṇa, some other penalty has to be imposed
upon him.—If however the maiden is willing and is violated by a man who
is her ‘equal’—belongs to the same caste as herself—then the penalty
shall be, not death, but the ‘highest amercement.’

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288) to the effect that even in the case
of a maiden of the same caste, if one has intercourse with her, when she
is not willing, the penalty is *death*; but *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that this
refers to non-Brāhmaṇas,—and that the ‘death, *vadha*’ means the
*cutting off of the male organ* and so forth;—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 157a).

It is quoted in Parāśaramādhava (Vyavahāra, p. 321);—and. in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 175), which explains the meaning to be that ‘if a
man despoils a virgin of the same caste without her consent, he deserves
*vadha*, not if he does it with her consent.
