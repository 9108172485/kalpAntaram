This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 171) which says:—If there
is anything remiss in the safety of the cows during the day, the
‘*vaktavyatā*,’ responsibility, blame, lies on the keeper; if it is at
night, then on the owner;—but if the ‘*yogakṣemam*’ (which is its
reading for ‘*yogakṣeme*,’ *i.e*.,) the agreement between the keeper and
the owner, is ‘otherwise,’ then during the night also, the keeper is
responsible.’

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 772), which explains ‘*vaktavyatā*’ as
fault or blame;—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which quotes Kullūka, who
explains the second half as meaning that ‘if during the night also the
cattle are in charge of the keeper, then if there is any thing wrong,
the blame lies on the keeper’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 81).
