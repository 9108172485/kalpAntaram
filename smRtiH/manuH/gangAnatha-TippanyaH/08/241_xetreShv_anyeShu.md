This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 769), which adds the
following—‘The meaning of the verse is as follows:—With the exception of
those fields which have been specifically mentioned by Manu to be such
that for damaging their crops cattle are *not* to be punished;—if the
crops of any other fields happen to be damaged, then the keeper is to be
fined one *kārṣāpaṇa* and a quarter’;—this should be understood as
referring to repeated and serious damage:—‘and in all cases of damage to
crops by cattle, the estimated produce of the field damaged should be
given to the owner.’

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 234), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Anyeṣu*,’ in the case of fields other than those lying on the
outskirts of the village and so forth;—the ‘cattle’ (to be fined) should
here be taken as standing for the *keeper* of the cattle;—it being
impossible for the *cattle* to pay a fine; the fine should be understood
to be a *paṇa and a quarter* for each head of cattle;—and in
*Vīvādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 65), which explains ‘*anyeṣu*,’ as,
‘lying at a distance.’
