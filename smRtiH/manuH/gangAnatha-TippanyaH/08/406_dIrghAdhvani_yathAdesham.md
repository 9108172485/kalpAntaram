This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 270), which
explains the meaning to be that for voyages by river, the freight, etc.
payable is to be determined by considerations of place and time; and in
the case of voyages *by sea*, there is no such hard and fast rule, the
freight payable being what is agreed upon in each case.

It is quoted in *V* *yavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 263), which has the
following notes:—What has been said in the preceding verse applies to
river-crossings; in the case of long voyages by river the fares are to
be determined by such considerations as whether the river is sluggish or
swift, whether the season is summer or the rains; for voyages by sea, no
rates can be fixed.
