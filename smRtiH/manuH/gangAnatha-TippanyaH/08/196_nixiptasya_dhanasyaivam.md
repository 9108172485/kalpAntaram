This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 95), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Akṣiṇvan*,’ not harassing the person who is believed
to have been the holder of the deposit;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 209), which explains ‘*aprakṣiṇvan*’ (which is its
reading for ‘*akṣiṇvan*’), as ‘not chastising.’
