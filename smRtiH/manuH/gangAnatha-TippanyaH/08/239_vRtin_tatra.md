This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.162) as laying down the necessity
of fencing fields and gardens; and *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds the following
notes:—‘*Tatra*’, round the field,—the fence should be so high that even
a tall animal like the camel should not be able to see the crops from
the other side;—‘*mukhānugam*’, enabling the mouth of the dog or the hog
lo reach the crops,—‘*mukhonantam*’ is another reading;—the meaning is
as “follows:—One should build a fence, like a wall, round the field,
which should be so high that the camel may not be able to see the crops;
and if there are any holes there, large enough to enable the dog or the
hog to thrust its mouth into it, then all these should be securely
closed up: If we read ‘*vā vārayet*’, then the second half is to be
taken as laying down another method of having the fence.
