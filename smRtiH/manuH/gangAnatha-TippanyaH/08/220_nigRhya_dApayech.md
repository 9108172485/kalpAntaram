“According to ‘others’ mentioned by Medhātithi, ‘four *Suvarṇas*, *or
six Niṣkas*, *or one Śatamāna*; Kullūka and Rāghavānanda also think it
possible that three separate fines may be inflicted according to the
circumstances of the case.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 182), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Nigṛhya*,’ having him hauled up;—‘*catuḥsuvarṇān*’
qualifying ‘*ṣaṭ niṣkān*’ means ‘six of those *Niṣkas* which consists of
4 *Suvarṇas* each the epithet ‘*catuḥsuvarṇān*’ being added for the
exclusion of the other two measures of the ‘*Niṣkas*’ that are found in
the Śāstras—*viz*. (*a*) ‘the *Niṣka* consists of 108 *Suvarṇas*,’ (*b*)
‘the *Niṣka* consists of 5 *Suvarṇas*.’—‘*Śatamāna*’ consists of 320
*Raktikās*.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.187), which notes that herein Manu
mentions *four* penalties—(1) Banishment (verse 219), (2) fine of four
*Suvarṇas*, (3) fine of 6 *Niṣkas* and (4) fine of one *Śatamāna*; and
any *one* of these may be inflicted in accordance with the peculiar
circumstances of each case, such as the caste, the capacity and other
things of the persons concerned.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 253), which also
regards the four as distinct penalties, to be determined according to
the caste, learning and other qualifications of the persons
concerned;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (107a), which says that ‘*Śatamāna*’ is
equal to 320 *Rattis*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 132a).
