‘*Prativeśya-anuveśya*’—‘Neighbour living in front—neighbour living at
the back’ (Medhātithi);—‘the next neighbour and the neighbour next to
him’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghvānanda).

‘*Māṣakam*’—‘Of gold’ (Medhātithi);—‘of silver’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 358), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kalyāṇe viṃśatidvije*,’ ‘at which twenty Brāhmaṇas
are entertained’;—at such a festival if one does not feed his front
neighbour and back neighbour,—both of whom are perfectly fit persons for
being entertained,—he should be fined one ‘*Māṣa*’ which should be
understood to be of *silver*, in view of the fact that Manu in the next
verse prescribes the *golden* ‘*māṣa*’ as the fine for the offence of
not feeding the neighbours at a rich entertainment.
