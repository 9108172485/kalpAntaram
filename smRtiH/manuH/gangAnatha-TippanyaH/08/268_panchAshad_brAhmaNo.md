This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2. 207), to the effect that the
Brāhmaṇa is to be fined 50 for insulting a Kṣatriya, 25 for insulting a
Vaiśya and 12½ for insulting a Śūdra;—in *Aparārka* (p. 808), to the
same effect, adding that so many *paṇas* are meant;—and in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 151), which adds that ‘*abhiśaṃsana*’ means
‘defaming,’ ‘insulting.’
