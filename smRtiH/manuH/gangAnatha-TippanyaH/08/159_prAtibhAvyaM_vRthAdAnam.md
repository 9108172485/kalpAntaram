‘*Vṛthādānam*’—‘Gifts promised in jest, or to clowns, bards and such
persons’ (Medhātithi, Nārāyaṇa and Kulluka).—‘gifts promised not for
religious purpose, but to singers and the like’ (Nandana).—

“Vaśiṣṭha (16.31) gives this verse as a well-known quotation. So Gautama
(12.41).”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 57), which adds the
following notes:—The term ‘*prātibhāvyam*’ refers here to sureties of
both kinds—surety for *appearance*, and surety for
*trust*;—‘*vṛthādānam*’ is *useless gifts*;—‘*ākṣikam*,’ that due to
gambling;—‘*saurikam*’, that due to wine-drinking;—the ‘gambling’ and
‘drinking’ meant here are of the *improper* kind;—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (76b).
