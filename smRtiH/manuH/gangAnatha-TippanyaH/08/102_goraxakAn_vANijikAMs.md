This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 674), and again on p. 681, as
indicating that in certain eventualities even a Brāhmaṇa may be
condemned to death;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 19);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Rajānīti, p. 268), which refers to *Aparārka* and adds that the term
‘*viprām*’ here stands for the illiterate Brhāmaṇa who does
cattle-tending &c., as also for such Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas as are
addicted to degraded vocations;—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 35 and Śrāddha,
p. 359);—in *Prāyascittaviveka* (p. 384);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra,
p. 205).
