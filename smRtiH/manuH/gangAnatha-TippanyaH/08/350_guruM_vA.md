“According to Kullūka the condition is that one must be unable to save
one self by fight;—according to Nārāyaṇa one must not wound such a man
excessively.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 784), which adds the
following explanation:—‘When even the Teacher and the rest, if they are
assassins, may be slain—what to say of others;’—which only means that
there is nothing wrong in the slaying of assassins other than the
Teacher and the rest; it is not meant that these latter are to be slain;
because we have the general prohibition that ‘no Brāhmaṇa shall be
killed.’

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 104);—in *Aparārka* (p. 627, and
again at p. 1043);—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*—(p. 1011);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 59), which says that ‘*eva*’ has been added for
the purpose of emphasis;—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 77).
