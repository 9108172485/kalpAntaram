This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 87), whieh adds the
following explanation:—On the death of the depositor, if the depository
deliver the deposit to the depositor’s heir, he should not be blamed
either by the king or by the dead man’s relatives. The term
‘*svayameva*’ implies that during the depositor’s life-time, he should
not deliver it to the heir, even though asked to do so by the
latter;—and that on his death he should give it to the heir even without
being asked to do so;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 37).
