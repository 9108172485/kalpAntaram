This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (22b), which explains
‘*dharmasthaḥ*’ as ‘one who is occupying the judgment seat’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 31b), which explains the construction
as—‘*mā*,’ *mām*, ‘*gnātāraḥ*,’ persons knowing that what I state is
true, &c., &c., as being, according to Medhātithi, but goes on to add,
that according to the Ācārya,’ ‘*meti*’stands for ‘*me-iti*,’ the
*sandhi* being explained as a Vedic anomaly. It notes the reading,
‘*Santi jñātāra ityuktvā*,’ as found in *Kalpataru*, but rejects it as
an unauthorised reading.
