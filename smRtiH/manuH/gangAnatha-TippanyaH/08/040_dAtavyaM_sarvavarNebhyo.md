This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 2.36), which adds:—(a) If the
king recovers the stolen property from the thieves and keeps it for
himself, he takes the sin of the thief, (b) if he ignores the theft,
then the sins of the people fall upon him; (c) if, having tried his best
to recover the stolen property, he fails to do so, he should make good
the loss out of his own treasury.
