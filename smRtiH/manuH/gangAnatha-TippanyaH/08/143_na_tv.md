“According to Medhātithi Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa, the last clause
refers to pledges which are not used; but Kullūka objects that this is
contrary to the common practice of the *Śiṣṭas*; and Rāghavānanda refers
to Yājñavalkya, 2.48. where it is clearly stated that beneficial pledges
only are never lost, while those which are merely kept are lost when the
original debt is doubled by unpaid interest.”—Buhler.

The first part of this verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 23),
which explains ‘*sopakāre*’ as ‘what is used or enjoyed’;—in *Aparārka*
(p. 659);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 15), which explains ‘*sopakāre*’ as
‘used’ or ‘enjoyed,’ and the mere fact of the thing having been used
deprives the creditor of the interest, and if, through some act of the
creditor, the article mortgaged loses its usefulness, the interest
ceases;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (70a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
95a).
