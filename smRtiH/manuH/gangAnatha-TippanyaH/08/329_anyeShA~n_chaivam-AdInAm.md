**(verses 8.326-329)  
**

These verses are quoted in *Vīvādaratnākara* (p. 326), which adds the
following notes:—*Anyeṣāmevamādīnām*’, *i.e*., pastries and the
like,—‘*anyat paśusambhavām*’, skins, tusks and so forth;—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 989);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 140),
which says that this refers to the case of the theft of small quantities
of yarn; and such as have been made ready for use.
