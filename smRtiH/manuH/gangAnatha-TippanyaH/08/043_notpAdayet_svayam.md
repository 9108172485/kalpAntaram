‘*Anyena*’—‘By another’,—*i.e*., the plaintiff (Medhātithi),—‘the
plaintiff or the defendant’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 22.5), where *Bālambhaṭṭī*
offers the following explanations of the second half of the verse:—(*a*)
The king should not entertain any suit illegally brought up by any
one;—or (*b*) he shall not ignore a suit brought forward by any
one;—(*c*) (if we adopt the reading ‘*na cāprāpitam*’) ‘he shall not
admit into the proceedings any facts not presented by either of the two
parties to the suit.’ The *Subodhinī* reproduces the same explanations.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 605), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Kāryam*’ here means ‘suit,’ ‘dispute’;—any proved fact that may
be adduced during the hearing of the suit, the king should not ignore or
set aside;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (13b), which explains ‘*na graset*’ as
‘he should not ignore’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 15b).
