This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 396), which adds the
following explanatory notes:—For having recourse to a guarded Brāhmaṇa
woman, the Vaiśya is to be imprisoned for one year and his entire
property is to be confiscated,—the Kṣatriya is to be fined 1000, and
shall have his head wetted with urine and then shaved;—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 1009).
