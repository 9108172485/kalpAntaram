It is difficult to see why Hopkins calls the reading ‘*dāḍhikāyām*,’
‘obscure.’

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 814), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Dāḍhikāyām*’—on the beard,—‘*Vṛsaṇeṣu* scrotum and the rest; if
the scrotum *alone* were meant, then the plural ending could not be
justified;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 268), which remarks that the dual
ending has been used in ‘*hastau*’ with a view to indicate that *both
hands* are to be cut off even though the beard be held by one only; and
it explains ‘*dāḍhikā*,’ as ‘beard’—and in *Vivādachintāmaṇi* (Calcutta,
p, 76), which explains these two verses to mean that ‘if a Śūdra insults
a man of any of the higher castes by spitting at him, his lips should be
cut off—if by urinating on his body, his urinary organ should be cut
off,—if by passing wind over him, the anus should be cut off,—and if by
catching hold of his hair, then his hands should be cut off.’
