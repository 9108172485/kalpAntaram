This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 632), which adds that, if the
user of the property knows that it rightfully belongs to another, then,
even though he may have acquired ownership by legal usage
(*vyavahārēṇa*), yet he should hand it over to the rightful owner;—in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 334);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 15b);—and
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 66a).
