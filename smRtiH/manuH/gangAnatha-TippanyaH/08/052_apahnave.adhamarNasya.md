‘*Deśam*’—There is no difference in the meaning assigned to the word by
Medhātithi and Kullūka,—both taking it in the sense of ‘witness’; the
meaning ‘place’, attributed to Medhātithi, is however found in Nandana
In his interpretation of Medhātithi, Buhler has been misled by the
explanation that Medhātithi has provided by another reading. (See
*Translation*).

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (24b), which adds the following
explanation:—When on being questioned in court by the king or the judge,
the debtor denies all transaction with the creditor, then the latter who

is the plaintiff, should name the witnesses and cite other proofs in the
form of written documents and so forth:—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 29b), which explains ‘*deśam*’ as ‘witness’, expounding it
as ‘*diṣati artham yathādṛṣṭam*’ and quotes Medhātithi’s explanation on
‘*karaṇam*’ also, which it explains as ‘other proofs’; it remarks that
Medhātithi reads ‘*kāraṇam vā samuddishet*.’
