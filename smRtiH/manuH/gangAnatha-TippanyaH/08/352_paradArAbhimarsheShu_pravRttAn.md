This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 853);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
388);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 174), which explains ‘*trīn*’ (which
is its reading for ‘*nṛṛn* ( *nṝn*?)’) as ‘persons of the three lower
castes, *i.e*., all except the Brāhmaṇas,’—and ‘*udvejanakaraiḥ*’ as the
‘cutting of the ears, nose, and so forth.’
