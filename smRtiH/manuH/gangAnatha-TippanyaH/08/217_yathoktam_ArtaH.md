This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 797), which explains
‘*Yathoktam*’ as ‘as agreed upon’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.198), to the effect
that—‘if the man,—on recovery, if he has been ill, or even while he is
in perfect health’,—does not complete the task of which only a little is
left undone,—either himself or through some one else,—then he should not
be given any wages at all—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (102a), which explains
‘*kārayet*’ as ‘gets it done by another person’, and ‘*alponasyāpi*’ as
‘even though only a very little be wanting in the completion of the
work.’
