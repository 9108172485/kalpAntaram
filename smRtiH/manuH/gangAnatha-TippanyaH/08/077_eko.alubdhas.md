This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 213), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Eko’ lubdhastu sākṣī*’ is the reading adopted by
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa; the other reading—‘*eko lubdhastvasākṣī*’—adopted by
Jīmūtavāhana, is not right; because as a matter of fact, even several
*avaricious men* would be *asākṣī*, and hence there would be no point in
the term ‘*ekaḥ*.’ But admitting this reading, the verse could be taken
as not admitting the evidence of *one* ‘avaricious man’, and thereby
admitting that of *one* man who is free from avarice, even though he be
ignorant of law. It is for this reason that Viśvarūpa and others have
explained the meaning to be that when accepted by both parties, even a
single man may be admitted as witness, and they have not laid stress
upon the condition that he should be ‘conversant with law;—‘*Dośaiḥ*’
stands for *theft* and so forth.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (32a).
