*Cf*. 2.19-11.

‘*Karma śārīram*’—‘With reference to occupation *and* to the body’
(Medhātithi);—‘bodily sacraments’ (Kullūka and others).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 254), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Karma*,’ austerities and the like;—‘*śārīram*,’ limbs
of the body,—‘*vitathena*,’ falsely,—the meaning being that if one,
through arrogance, spreads false reports regarding the learning,
country, caste, austerities, and limbs of another, he shall be fined
200. The Instrumental ending in ‘*Vitathena*’ is in accordance with
*Pāṇini’s Sūtra* ‘*Prakṛtyādibhya upasaṅkhyānam*’;—‘*Śruta*’, ‘learning’
and the rest are mentioned by way of illustration of the false reports;
*e*.*g*.—‘This man has not learnt the Veda,’ ‘he is not an inhabitant of
Āryāvarta,’ ‘he is not a Brāhmaṇa,’ ‘he has performed no austerity at
all,’ ‘his skin is not free from disease’ and so forth.—‘*Darpa*’ stands
for the high opinion that one has in regard to his own qualifications
and consequently the low opinion that he has with regard to other
persons.
