This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.263), where *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—Carts laden with merchandise should be made to pay
according to the value of the merchandise they carry; those that are
empty as also ‘*aparicchadāḥ*,’ poor persons, may be made to pay some
little amount.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 834), which has the following
notes:—Carts laden with merchandise should each pay according to the
value of the merchandise carried; when they are empty, they may pay a
small amount; so also persons without accoutrements.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 270), which adds the
following explanations:—Carts laden with merchandise should be made to
pay in accordance with the large or small value of the merchandise
carried; empty carts and poor persons may pay some amount smaller than
the eighth part of a *paṇa*. It adds that the rule applies to river-
*crossings*. For voyages by river the rates are different (see next
verse).
