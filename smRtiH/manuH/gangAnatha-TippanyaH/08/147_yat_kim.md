This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 222), which adds the
following explanation:—‘If the rightful owner of a property looks upon
his property being used by another, without his presenting it to him as
a friendly gift, or some such thing,—and does not speak out,
complain,—for ten years, then he is no longer entitled to receive it;
*i.e*., his ownership over it ceases’;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
101),—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 65b).
