‘*Śūdrabhūyiṣṭham*’—‘Where Śūdras form a majority among judges’
(Medhātithi);—‘where Śūdras, *i*. *e*., disbelievers, form the majority
of inhabitants’ (Kullūka);—‘where Śūdras form the majority among holders
of high office’ (Nandana).

Medhātithi does not explain ‘*Śūdra*’ here as ‘unbelievers’; he has been
misrepresented by Hopkins.
