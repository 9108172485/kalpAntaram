Clothes etc. are meant, according to Medhātithi;—clothes, ornaments etc.
according to Kullūka and Rāghavānanda;—beds and so forth, according to
Nārāyaṇa, who adds that the ‘value’ stands for “the profit made by the
use of the pledge”—(Buhler).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 24), which adds the
following notes:—If the creditor uses the pledge without the debtor’s
permission, then he loses only a half of the interest; hut if he uses
it, even though actually prohibited to do so, then he loses the whole
interest;—if he does not give up the interest, then he should satisfy
the pledger by paying him the price, fixed by valuation, of the use of
the article pledged.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 76);—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(70a), which adds that if the thing has been only half used, and has not
undergone change, then the man loses only half the amount of his
interest, but if the thing becomes changed, then he loses the whole
amount of the interest.
