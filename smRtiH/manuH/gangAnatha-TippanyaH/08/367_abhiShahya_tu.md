This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321), to the
effect that two fingers are to be cut off if the man only defiles the
maiden with his fingers;—in *Aparārka* (p. 858), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Abhiṣahya*’, forcibly,—‘*kuryāt*,’ defile the maiden
by the introduction of fingers,—the two fingers (its reading being
‘*kartye aṅgulyau*’) with which he defiles her should be cut off at
once, without delay;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which has the
following notes:—‘*Abhiṣahya*,’ insolently,—‘*kuryāt*,’ should
defile,—‘*kalpye*’ (which is its reading for ‘*kartye*’), should be cut
off;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288), to the effect that when a man defiles
an unwilling maiden of the same caste as himself by thrusting his
fingers into her, he should be fined 600 and two of his fingers should
be cut off.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
