This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (65b), which adds the following
explanation:—An agreement, even though formally put in writing, has no
legal force, if it is contrary to the laws and customs prevalent among
business-men; and such an agreement cannot be enforced,—such agreement,
for instance, as where a man who has children agrees to bequeath all his
property to a stranger.

It is quoted also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 21b and 39b), which has
the following notes—‘*Pratiṣṭhita*’, free from the defect of being
impossible and unknown and so forth,—‘*bhāṣā*’, proposition,
statement,—is not ‘*satya*,’ accepted by the king or the court,—‘that
statement which is contrary to all rules of business, even though it be
established by evidence, oral and documentary, should not be accepted’;
*e.g*., the statement that ‘this man has promised his entire property to
me’,—when the man concerned is one who has got sons and oilier
successors.
