This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 854);—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p.
384), which addṣ the following notes:—‘*Pūrvamakṣāritaḥ*’, already
previously suspected of entertaining longings for that lady;—the
punishment is to be inflicted only in a case where the conversation is
not held under circumstances unfavourable to intercourse;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 156a), which explains ‘*doṣaiḥ*’ as
‘tendency to run after women,’ and adds that this refers to cases where
the conversation is held with evil intentions.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 106), as laying down the penalty
for a man of wicked character holding conversation with another man’s
wife;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 172), which explains the meaning to
be that ‘if a man who has been once suspected of illicit connection with
a woman should meet her in private and talk to her longer than ordinary
courtesy demands, he should be punished with the first amercement.’
