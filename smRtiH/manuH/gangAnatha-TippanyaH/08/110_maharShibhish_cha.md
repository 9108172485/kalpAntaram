‘*Paijavana*’ is another name for king Sudās, say Nārāyāṇa and Kullūka.

For the story of the seven sages, see the Mahābhārata 13.93; 13. “See
Sāyana on Ṛgveda 7.104.15, which is considered to contain the oath
sworn.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 406);—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (62a).
