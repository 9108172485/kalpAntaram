This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 352), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Cārmikam*’, ‘shoes and other leather goods,’—some
people explain that in the expressions ‘*carmacārmikam*’, the first
‘*carma*’ serves the purpose of making the meaning
clearer,—‘*kāṣṭhamayam*’, the *Prostha* and such
things,—‘*loṣṭṛamayam*’, the jar and such things,—the fine equal to five
times the value of the flowers eta is one that has been laid down by
Bṛhaspati also, but elsewhere Manu has laid down the fine to be hundred
and more times the value of the flower etc.,—and these are to be
reconciled by the view that the exact fine in each case is to be
determined by the quality of the flower etc., damaged;—it has to be
noted that the satisfaction of the injured party has to be seemed in
these cases also.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 820).
