This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 11), which adds that the
term ‘*Samudrayānakuśalāḥ*’ stands for *all
merchants*;—‘*deśakālārthadarśinaḥ*,’ those who know that in such and
such a country such and such profit is to be made;—‘*adhigama*’ is
‘decision’ *i.e*., ‘by that is the interest to be determined;’—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (68a), which has the following
notes:—‘*Samudrayānakuśalāḥ*’ stands for tradesmen in
general,—‘*deśakālārthadarśinaḥ*,’ one who knows what profit is obtained
at what time,—‘*adhigama*’ is *decision*, *finding*.
