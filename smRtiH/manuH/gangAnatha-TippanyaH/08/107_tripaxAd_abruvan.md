Hopkins again misrepresents Nandana as reading ‘*gatonaraḥ*’ for
‘*Narogadaḥ*.’ It is clear that Hopkins had a very defective manuscript
of Nandana’s commentary.

This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (37b);—in *Aparārka* (p. 677),
to the effect that it is only in cases relating to debts and the like
that the absentee witness who is fit to attend, does not attend;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (on 2.76) which adds that ‘*agadaḥ*’ stands for freedom from
disease and state or divine oppression;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra,
p. 213), which explains ‘*agadaḥ*’ as ‘in good health,’—‘*tadṛnam*’ as
that which can be proved by means of witnesses;—‘*sarvam*’ as ‘along
with accrued interest,’ and ‘*prāpnuyāt*’ as ‘should be paid’;—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 54b) which explains that ‘*agadaḥ*’ stands
for the ‘absence of obstacles arising either from natural causes or from
some action of the king.’
