title = "378 सहस्रम् ब्राह्मणो"

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 317), which
remarks that this refers to cases where the woman is not the wife of
one’s teacher or friend;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393);—in
*Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 105), as laying down the penalty for forcible
intercourse with a chaste Brāhmaṇa woman;—in *Mitākṣarā* (p. 256) where
*Bālambhaṭṭī* notes that inasmuch as the latter half contains the
epithet ‘*icchantyā*,’ ‘willing,’—which is in contradistinction to
‘*balāt*,’ ‘by force,’ of the former half,—it follows that in case the
first half refers to the *guarded* woman, the second half must refer to
the *unguarded* one; the meaning being that if a Brāhmaṇa has connection
only once with a willing woman of the same caste, he should be fined
500;—in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 330);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
144b and 155b), which explains ‘*guptam*’ as ‘properly guarded’; and
adds that this refers to cases of adultery other than those with the
wife of the *guru* or the *friend*, for which latter other penalties
have been prescribed.
