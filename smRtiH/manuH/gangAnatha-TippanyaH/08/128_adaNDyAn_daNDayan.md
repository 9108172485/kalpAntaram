This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 649);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 391), as prohibiting the punishment of the innocent;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 25);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.1), to the
effect that the non-investigation of cases as well as the wrong
investigation of them,—both bring sin upon the king;—in *Nītimayūkha*
(p. 59);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, p. 5a).
