This verse is quoted in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (82b), which explains
‘*mahāpakṣa*’ as one who has a large family;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 204);—and in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 85), which explains
‘*mahāpakṣa*’ as ‘one having a large family’,—and ‘*nikṣepam*’ as
‘*nikṣepyam*,’ *i*.*e*., the *thing deposited*;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*
(p. 36), which explains ‘*mahāpakṣa*’ as ‘one who has a large number of
relatives.’
