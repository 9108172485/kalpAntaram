“Dropsy is a disease specially attributed to Varuṇa (see Ṛgveda 7.89.1,
and the story of Śunaḥśepha, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.15). The fetters of
Varuṇa are mentioned as the punishment of liars in the Atharva Veda,
4.16.6.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Vyavahāra, p. 199);—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (33b), which explains ‘*śatam-ājātīḥ*’ as ‘during a
hundred lives’;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 53b).
