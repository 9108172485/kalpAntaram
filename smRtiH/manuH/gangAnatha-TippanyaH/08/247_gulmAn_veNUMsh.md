This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 202), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Gulmāḥ*’, branchless shrubs,—‘*vallyaḥ*’; the
*guḍūcī* and other creepers,—‘*sthalāni*’, artificial
earth-mounds,—‘*kubjaka gulma*’, bushes of *kubjaka* (Rose).

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.151), whereon *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—‘*Gulma*’ is shrub without branches, or merely
grass-clump,—‘*sthala*’ is artificially elevated
ground,—‘*daṇḍakagulma*’ (which is one reading for ‘*kubjakagulma*’) is
not the right reading, the correct one being ‘*kupyakagulma*’, which
means ‘such shrubs as are related to (used in the cleaning and polishing
of) copper and other metals (except gold and silver)’;—‘*tathā*’,
*i.e*., ‘on this being done’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 93).
