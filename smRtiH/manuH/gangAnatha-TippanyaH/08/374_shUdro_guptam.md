This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra p. 378), to the
effect that when a Śūdra has intercourse with an *unguarded* woman of a
higher caste, his organ is to be cut off and all his property
confiscated, and if he has recourse to a *guarded* woman of the higher
caste, he shall suffer death and his entire property shall be
confiscated.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 395), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Dvaijātam varṇam*’, a woman of the twice-born
caste,—‘*āvasan*’, having recourse to,—‘*aguptaikāṅgasarvasvī*’ (which
is its reading for ‘*aguptamaṅgasarvasvī*’), if the woman is one who is
*not guarded*, the man shall be deprived of one limb and also of his
entire property; and of his entire property as also of his entire body
(if the woman is one who is *guarded*).

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.280), which has the same explanation as
the one in para 1 above;—in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 100), which also has
the same explanation—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 156a).
