‘*Upakḷptāni*’—(*a*) ‘Ready for being put to use, in the way of gift,
enjoyment and so forth, or (*b*) specially prepared or embellished’
(Medhātithi);—‘Ready for use’ (Kullūka and Rāghavānanda). No commentator
explains the term as ‘thread worked into cloth’; Buhler has no
justification for attributing it to ‘Medh., Gov., Kull., and Rāgh.’

‘*Agni*’—‘Consecrated fire’ (Medhātithi and Kullūka);—also the ordinary
fire (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 140), which says the
‘fire’ meant is that which has been consecrated by either *Śrauta* or
*Smārta* rites.
