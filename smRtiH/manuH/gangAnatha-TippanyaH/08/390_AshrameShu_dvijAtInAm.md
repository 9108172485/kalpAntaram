‘*Āśrameṣu*’—‘The hermitages of Vānaprasthas and other hermits living in
the forest’ (Medhātithi);—‘the Householder’s and other life-stages’
(Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 4);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 10a), which explains ‘*āśrameṣu kārye*’ as ‘business arising
out of the life-stages’;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (10a), which explains
‘*āśrameṣu*’ as ‘in the matter of the life-stages’,—and ‘*na vibrūyāt*,’
as ‘should not apportion victory and defeat.’
