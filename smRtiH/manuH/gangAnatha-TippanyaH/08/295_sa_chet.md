This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 282), which explains the
meaning to be that in a case where being inefficiently driven by the
driver, the chariot happens to be obstructed on the road by another
chariot or by an animal, and thereby causes hurt to a living being, the
punishment is to be inflicted on the driver, ‘*avicāritaḥ*,’ most
surely.

It is quoted in ‘*Bālambhaṭṭī*’ on 2.300.
