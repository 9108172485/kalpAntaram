‘*Kṛmibhiḥ*’—‘A special kind of worm called *Ārohakas*’ (Medhātithi)
‘snakes and so forth’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 773), which adds that the keeper
is to make good the loss by paying the price of the animal lost;—and
that ‘*nāśa*’ of the animal here meant is its being not found, lost;—in
*Mitākṣarā* (2.164), as describing the loss of cattle through
carelessness;—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 173), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Naṣṭam*,’ stolen;—‘*vinaṣṭam*,’ destroyed—by whom?—‘*by
worms*’;—the ‘dog’ stands for other animals also;—‘*viṣame*,’ place
difficult of access; such as the hill-top and so
forth;—‘*puruṣakāreṇa*,’ care and means of rescue adopted by the
keeper;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 81), which has the following
notes:—‘*Naṣṭam*’ stolen by thieves and others,—*i.e*., what became lost
for want proper care on the part of the keeper,—this negligence being
the reason why the man should be made to make good the loss;—in
*Kṛtyakalpataru* (105a), which says that ‘*śva*’ in ‘*śvahatam*’ stands
for carnivorous animals in general;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
1362), which explains ‘*viṣame*’ as ‘in an inaccessible place,’ and
‘*hīnaṃ puruṣakāreṇa*’ as ‘what has been destroyed for want of that care
which was possible for man to give.’
