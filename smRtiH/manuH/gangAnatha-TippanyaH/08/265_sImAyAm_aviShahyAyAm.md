This Verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.153), to the effect that between
the two villages (disputing over their boundary), the king shall allot
the disputed plot to that one to which it would be more useful than to
the other.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 764), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Aviṣahyā*’, without any means of determination, in the shape
persons or proofs,—‘*pravishet*’ (which is its reading for
‘*pradishet*’), is equivalent to ‘*praveśayet*,’ put into
possession,—‘*upakārāt*,’ on the ground of utility.

It is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 216), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Aviṣahyā*’, unascertainable in the absence of
witnesses,—‘*ekeṣām pradishet upakārāt*,’ he should give it to one
party, on the ground of ‘utility’ *i*. *e*., to that party which is
likely to derive greater benefit from the land in dispute; when this
benefit is found to be equally possible for both parties, then he should
divide the land between both.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhavā* (Vyavahāra, p. 275), which explains
‘*aviṣahyā*’ as ‘there being neither witnesses nor any other indications
helping to determine it;’—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Vyavahāra, 31a);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 142,) which explains ‘*aviṣahyāyam*’ as
‘that for which no determinent is available in the shape either of
witnesses or marks.’
