This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara'* (p. 239), which explains
‘*deva-paśu*’ as ‘cattle dedicated to the gods’;—in *Aparārka* (p.
771);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 268), which explains ‘*vṛṣa*’
as (*a*) ‘*mahokṣa*,’ *i*.*e*., ‘large bull,’ or (*b*) ‘bulls dedicated
by the rite called *vṛṣotsarga*’;—and in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 530), which
adds that the cattle mentioned here, if they do any damage, are simply
to be driven away;—and in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 811);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta p. 68), which explains ‘*vṛṣān*’ as
‘breeding bulls.’
