This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 250), which adds the
following:—The rule laid down in the preceding verse is applicable to
the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also;—‘*Svajātiṃprati*’—‘as between persons of
the same caste’ (the punishment is to be inflicted) ‘*tattvataḥ*,’ in
accordance with the superiority or inferiority of position and
qualifications;—‘*chedavarjam*’, this precludes the cutting of the
tongue.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (2.207), to the effect that when the Vaiśya
abuses the Śūdra, he is to be fined 50 *paṇas*. *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the
following notes:—‘*Viṭśūdrayoḥ* in the case of the Vaiśya and the
Śūdra—‘*Svajātiṃ prati*’—insuring each other,—‘*evameva*,’ the case is
to be treated as in the case of the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya,—*i*.
*e*., when the Vaiśya insults the Śūdra, he should pay the ‘first
amercement,’ and when the Śūdra insults the Vaiśya, he should pay the
‘middle amercement,’—this should be the penalty inflicted, and there is
to be no cutting of the tongue;—‘*tattvataḥ*,’ this is the legal
punishment.—This verse, as also the preceding one, refers to a case
where the defamation is in regard to a heinous offence.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 150a).
