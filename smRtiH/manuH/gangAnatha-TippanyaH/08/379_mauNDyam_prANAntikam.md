This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 393), which adds the
explanation that ‘for an offence in connection with which death penalty
has been prescribed, the Brāhmaṇa shall only have his head shaved’;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 399);—in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p.
159);—in *Aparārka* (p. 681), which adds that *banishment from the city*
and such other penalties are equal to the death-penalty, so far as the
Brāhmaṇa is concerned;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 115);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 58b).
