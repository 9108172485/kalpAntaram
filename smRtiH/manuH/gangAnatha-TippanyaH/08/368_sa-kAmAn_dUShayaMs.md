This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 403), which adds that this
applies to the case where the maiden is of a lower caste;—in
*Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 321);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.288) as
providing for a case where the finger-defilement occurs in the case of a
willing maiden. *Bālambhaṭṭī* adds that ‘*tulyaḥ*’ means a man of the
same caste as the girl;—he is to be fined 200 with a view to prevent
repetition.

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 157a).
