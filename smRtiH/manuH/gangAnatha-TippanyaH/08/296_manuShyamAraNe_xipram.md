This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 283), which adds the
following notes:—The term ‘*chauravat*’ indicates the fine that has been
prescribed in connection with the ‘highest amercement’,—and not
*mutilation or death*; as there could be no ‘half’ of the latter,—such a
half being prescribed in the latter part of the verse for causing hurt
to cows and such other animals.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāramayūkha* (p. 109);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 291);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.300), where *Bālambhaṭṭī*
adds the following noṭes:—If a man is killed by a chariot, going astray
by reason of the careless driver, then he at once becomes as great an
offender as a thief, and liable to be punished as a thief ‘*Kilviṣam*’
is another reading for ‘*kilviṣī*’; and the penalty meant here must be
the ‘highest amercement,’ not *death*, since the second half of the
verse speaks of the ‘half’ of the said penalty, by which ‘half a fine of
500 is meant, for the offence of killing such larger animals as the cow
and the like.
