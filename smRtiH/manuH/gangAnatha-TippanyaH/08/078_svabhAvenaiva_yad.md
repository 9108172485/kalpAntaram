‘*Svabhāvena*’—‘Quite naturally’—‘not out of compassion’ (Medhātithi,
who says nothing regarding ‘depending on women’ as Buhler wrongly puts
it),—‘not out of fear and the like’ (Kullūka);—‘the reliability or
otherwise of the witness is to be ascertained after due consideration of
his *Svabhāva*, character, and not from the manner of bis giving
evidence’ (‘others’ in Medhātithi),—‘without hesitation, quickly’
(Nārāyaṇa);—‘in accordance with truth’ (Govindarāja and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 80);—and in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 282).
