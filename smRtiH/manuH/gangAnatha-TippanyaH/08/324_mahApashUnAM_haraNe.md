This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 319), which adds the
following notes—‘*Mahāpaśu*’ are the elephant and other large
animals,—‘*kālam*’, whether it was stolen at the time of war, or during
ordinary use and so forth,—‘*kāryam*’, smallness or largeness of the use
to which the stolen thing was being put,—‘*daṇḍam*’, heavier or lighter.
