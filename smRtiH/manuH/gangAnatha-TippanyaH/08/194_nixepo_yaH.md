This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664), which explains ‘*vibruvan*’
as ‘telling what is not true;’—in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 94), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Vibruvan*,’ declaring it to be more when it was
less; from a parity of reasoning, it follows that if the depository also
declares the deposit to be less where it was really more, he also should
be fined;—and in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (85a).
