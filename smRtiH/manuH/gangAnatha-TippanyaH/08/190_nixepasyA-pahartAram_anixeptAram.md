‘*Sārvaiḥ upāyaiḥ*’—‘All kinds of evidence, the four expedients of
kindness and the rest, and also in the case of wicked people, beating
and imprisoning’ (Medhātithi, who is not rightly represented by
Buhler);—‘the four expedients of kindness and so forth’ (Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘spies and the like’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 208), as laying
down punishment for the depositor and depository if proved to be
dishonest;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*, (84a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 113a).
