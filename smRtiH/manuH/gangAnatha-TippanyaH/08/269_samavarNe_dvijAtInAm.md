This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 149), which adds the
following notes:—No special stress is meant to be laid here on the
mention of the ‘twice-born’ (what is stated being equally applicable to
all castes);—‘*vyatikrame*’ means *defamation*, other than the
divulging, of *a secret*, which latter is what is spoken of by the
phrase ‘*vāde avacanīye*.’

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 49a).
