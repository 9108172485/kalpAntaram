This verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 772), which explains ‘*Kilviṣī*’
(its reading being ‘*na* *pālastatra kilviṣī*,’ for ‘*na* *pālo
dādumarhati*’) as ‘blame-worthy’;—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.164) to the effect
that the keeper should not be made to pay to the owner the value of such
cattle as are carried away by thieves ‘*by force*,’ *i*.*e*., openly, by
beat of drums and so forth;—provided that he reports it to the owner at
the same time and places (this latter being added in *Bālambhatṭṭī* as
explaining the latter half of the verse);—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*, (p. 81)
which explains ‘*deśe*’ as ‘place where a search could be made;’—and in
*Kṛtyakalpataru*, (105a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 137a),
which explains ‘*vighuṣya*’ as ‘with a flourish of the trumpet’ and so
forth,—‘*deśe*’ as at ‘the place where the master lives’,—and *kāle* as
‘immediately after the robbery’.
