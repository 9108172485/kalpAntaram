This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p, 268) in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Vyavahāra, p. 288), which adds that, though in the case of other castes
raising a weapon to strike one of a higher caste, the penalty is to be
the ‘first amercement,’ yet for the Śūdra it has to be the cutting of
the hand and other limbs.

This is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 814);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.215), to the
effect that in the case of the Śūdra for merely raising a weapon, the
hand is to be cut off;—in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 75);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 146b).
