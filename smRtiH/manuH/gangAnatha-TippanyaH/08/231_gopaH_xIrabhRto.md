This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 170), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Kṣīrabhṛtaḥ*’, whose wages consist of milk
only;—‘*duḥyad daśato varām*,’ he should milk that cow (for himself)
which is the best among ten cows;—‘*sā*,’ the said milk of the one
cow;—‘*pāle*’, for the cowherd;—‘*abhṛte*,’ who is not paid any thing
else in the shape of fooding, clothing, and so forth.

This is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 772) winch adds the following
explanation:—That keeper of the cattle who has his wages paid in milk,
shall, with the owner’s permission, milk the best cow among ten milch
cows, taking that for himself,—this being the ‘wage’ of the
cattle-keeper who does not receive wages in any other form;—in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 80), which explains ‘*Kṣīrabhṛtaḥ*’ as ‘one whose
wages are paid in the form of milk only’;—he shall milk the best of ten
cows;—‘*abhṛte*’, the keeper who gets no fooding and clothing,—and notes
that this refers to the keeper of milch-cattle only:—in *Kṛtyakalpataru*
(104b), which explains ‘*Ksīrabhṛtaḥ*’ as ‘one whose wages consist of
milk only; he shall milk for himself that cow which may be the best
among ten cows—but only once’; —‘*abhṛte*’ one who receives no food or
clothing;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra, 136b), which says that the
milk of the best among ten cows is to be taken by the cowherd only when
he receives nothing else as wages.
