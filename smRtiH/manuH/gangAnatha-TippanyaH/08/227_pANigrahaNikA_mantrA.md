This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 585), to the
effect that ‘marriage’ is accomplished on the reaching of the seventh
step;—and again at p. 836, to the effect that the taking of the ‘seven
steps’ is absolutely essential.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 893), to the effect that the taking of
the seven steps constitutes an essential factor in the sanctificatory
rite of marriage;—again in *Smṛtitattva* (II, p. 107), to the same
effect;—again at p. 130, where the following notes are added—‘*niṣṭhā*,’
means *completion*, of ‘wife-hood,’—‘*saptame pāde*,’ *i.e*., on the
seven steps being reached by the girl;—in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p.
529);—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 222);—and in *Hāralatā* (p. 52)
which has the following notes:—‘*Niyatam*’, *i.e*., bringing about
wife-hood, all the other details being mere accessories.
