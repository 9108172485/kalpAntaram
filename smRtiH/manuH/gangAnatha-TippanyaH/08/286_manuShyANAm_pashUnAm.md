This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 266), which adds that
‘*duḥkhāya*’ means ‘with the intention of giving pain and the addition
of this implies that there is no crime if the hurt is caused by
chance;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 75), which explains
‘*duḥkhāya*’ as ‘with the intention of causing pain.’
