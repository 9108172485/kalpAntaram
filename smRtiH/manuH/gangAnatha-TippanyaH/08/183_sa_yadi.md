This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 664);—and in *Vivādaratnākara*
(p. 94), which continues the explanation (see last note)—‘If the man
admit the deposit and surrender it exactly in the condition in which it
had been deposited—neither more nor less,—then the king should conclude
that the former deposit, the subject-matter of the dispute, had not been
made over to him, and he should be acquitted of the charge brought
against him by the other party’.
