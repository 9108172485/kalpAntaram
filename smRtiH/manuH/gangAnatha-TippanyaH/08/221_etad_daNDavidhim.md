This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 253);—in
*Vivādaratnākara* (p. 182), which explains ‘*Jātisamūha*’ as ‘community
of several castes’:—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (107a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Vyavahāra, 132a), which adds that the penalty to be imposed in each
case is to be determined by considerations of caste, learning and other
qualifications of the culprit.
