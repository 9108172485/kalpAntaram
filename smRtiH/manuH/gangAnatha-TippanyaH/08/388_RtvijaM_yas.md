This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 122), which adds that
whether the fine is to be 200 or 100 is to be determined by the offence
being intentional or unintentional, and also by the richness or poverty
of the offender.

It is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 837), which adds that this rule applies
to such priests as are hereditary, or have been appointed by the man
himself;—in *Kṛtyakalpataru* (91a);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Vyavahāra,
120a).
