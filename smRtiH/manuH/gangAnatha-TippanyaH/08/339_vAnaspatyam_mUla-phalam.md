This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (II, p. 252);—in
*Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 116), which says that what is meant is that the
sin of the act is removed by the use mentioned, and *not* that it is not
a case of ‘theft’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 147), which says that
the ‘*fruits*’ meant should be such as do not belong to another person.
