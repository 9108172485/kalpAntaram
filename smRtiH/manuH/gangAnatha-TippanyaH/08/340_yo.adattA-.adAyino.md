This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 340), which explains
‘*adattādāyin*’ as *the thief*, and adds that ‘*api*’ includes also
*gifts* and so forth;—and in *Mitākṣarā* (2.113), which remarks that if
‘proprietary right’ were something purely *temporal*, then there would
be no justification for the penalty being inflicted on the Brāhmaṇa who
acquires wealth by teaching and sacrificing for thieves, as laid down in
the present text. *Bālambhaṭṭī* has the following notes:—‘*Adattādāyin*’
means ‘one who *takes* (*ādadāti*) another’s property when it is *not
given* (*adattam*) by him’;—in ‘*yājanādhyāpanena*’ (or ‘—*nāt*’ as read
in *Mitākṣarā*) we have the causative copulative compound;—‘*api*’
includes *gift* also.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (p. 992);—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 144).
