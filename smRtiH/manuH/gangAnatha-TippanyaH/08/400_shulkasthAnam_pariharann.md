This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 297), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Śulka*’ is the duty realised by the king on all sales
and purchases,—the ‘*sthānas*’ of this are the customs-outposts
established by the king on rivers, in cities, on mountains, and so
forth;—when themerchant reaches these out-posts, he should pay the
custom; he should never seek to avoid their payment by going by
untrodden tracks;—if with a view to avoiding customs-outposts, the
merchant should seek to carry on his sale and purchases at the improper
time—*e.g*., at night,—or if he declares his goods falsely,—then he
should be made to pay a fine which is eight times the value of the
commodity in question.

It is quoted in *Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī*, (p. 955).
