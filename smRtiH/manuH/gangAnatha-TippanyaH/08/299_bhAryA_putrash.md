This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 271), which explains that
the *younger* ‘brother’ is meant;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p.
514);—in *Aparārka* (p. 610, and also p. 817);—in
*Vyavahāra-Bālambhaṭṭī* (pp. 572 and 919);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
52);—in *Samskāraratnamālā* (p. 314), which says that the specific
mention of the ‘uterine’ brother indicates that the half-brother shall
not be beaten;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 142), which says
that this beating should be done only when the boy proves intractable to
chiding and other means;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta, p. 76).
