The second half of this verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.38), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Dadhi* and *kṣīra*’ stand for all
preparations of milk and curd; ‘*ghṛtam*’ for all oily substances;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 232), which adds that ‘*kṣaudram*’ stands for
*bees-wax*, honey itself being mentioned separately (‘*madhu*’);—and in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 123).
