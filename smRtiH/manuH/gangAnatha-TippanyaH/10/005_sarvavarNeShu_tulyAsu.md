‘*Ānulomyena*’.—‘In the direct order, *i.e*., by a Brāhmaṇa on a
Brāhmaṇī and so forth’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘the
bridegroom being always older than the bride” (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 511), which
explains the meaning to be that children born of a Brāhmaṇa couple are
Brāhmaṇa by caste; so also in the case of Kṣatriya couples and so
forth;—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra 76a).
