Nārāyaṇa thinks that ‘*Kṛṣi*’ means here that agriculture whereat the
Brāhmaṇa himself does not do any manual work; bat Govindarāja and
Kullūka reject this view.

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā*, (3.35), to the; effect that in
abnormal times for purposes of livelihood the Br āh maṇa may have
recourse to the functions of the Vaiśya, but never to those of the
*Śūdra*;—in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 232);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika,
36b).
