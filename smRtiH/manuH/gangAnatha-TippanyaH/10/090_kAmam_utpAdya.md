‘*Śuddhān*’—‘unmixed’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘white’ (Nandana);—‘of good quality’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 431) as permitting
the selling of sesamum. It notes on this point two views—(*a*) that what
is said here refers to *exchanging*, and (*b*) that it permits the
selling only for the purpose of paying off a debt not otherwise
payable;—aṇd it prefers the latter.

It is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.39), which adds that ‘*dharma*’ stands
for such necessities as medication and the like.
