The first half of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 161);—in
*Mitākṣarā* (1.120);—and the whole verse in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra p.
421), to the effect that the highest duty of the Śūdra is saving the
Brāhmaṇa, that of the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya being meant only as a
means of livelihood;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* II (p. 728);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 126);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 46),
which explains ‘*viśiṣṭam*’ as ‘excellent,’ as conducive to both *merit*
and *livelihood*, and ‘*niṣphalam*’ as ‘very little effective,’ as
conducive to *livelihood only*.
