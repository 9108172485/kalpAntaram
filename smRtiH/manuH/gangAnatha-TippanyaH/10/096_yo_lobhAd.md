This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 363), which adds the
explanation that—‘if the Vaiśya or other lower castes should have
recourse to the modes of living ordained for the higher castes, he
should have all his property confiscated and then banished from the
kingdom;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (Calcutta p. 101).
