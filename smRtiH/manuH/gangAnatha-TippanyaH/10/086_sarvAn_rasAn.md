This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta*, (p. 232), which explains
‘*vyapoheta*’ (which is its reading for ‘*apoheta*’) as ‘should avoid’
*i.e*. ‘should not sell’; it adds that ‘*rasa*’ having been already
mentioned, ‘*lavaṇa*’ is mentioned again for the purpose of indicating
that the selling of *salt* is more blameworthy.
