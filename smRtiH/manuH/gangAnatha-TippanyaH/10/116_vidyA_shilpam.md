“Govindarāja thinks that teaching for a stipulated fee is also
permissible under this rule.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 936);—and in *Mitākṣarā* (3.42),
both of which read ‘*giriḥ*’ for ‘*dhṛtiḥ*;’ ‘*giriḥ*’ is explained by
Nandana as ‘selling of fruits and roots growing on hills.’
