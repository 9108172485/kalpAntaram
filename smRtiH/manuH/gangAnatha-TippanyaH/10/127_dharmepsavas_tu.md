This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 381), as prohibiting for
*Śūdras* the performance of rites accompanied with the reciting of
*mantras*;—and in *Śāntimayūkha* (p. 2), which quotes Medhātithi’s view
that ‘this verse entitles Śūdras only to Fasts and such acts as are done
without the use of Vedic *mantras*, and it is not meant that they are to
do even those acts that require the use of *mantras*, but they are not
to use *mantras*,’—and says that this view is not correct, because to
Fasts and other such acts they are entitled by virtue of the injunctions
of those acts themselves, and the present verse would be superfluous.
