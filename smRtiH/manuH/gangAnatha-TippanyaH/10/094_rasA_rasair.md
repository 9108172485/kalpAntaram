This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.39), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Kṛtānna*’ is cooked food, and this should be exchanged with
cooked food; it notes the. reading ‘*Kṛtānnañcākṛtannena*’, and explains
it as ‘cooked food should be exchanged for uncooked rice and other
grains’.

of sesamum applies to that of *rasas* also;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p.
124);—and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 429).
