If the daughter of a Brāhmaṇa from a Śudrā female and all their
descendants marry Brāhmaṇas, the offspring of the sixth female
descendant of the original couple will become a Brāhmaṇa (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda).—If the son of a Brāhmaṇa from a
Śūdra female marries a similar girl possessed of excellent virtues and
if his descendants go on doing the same, the child born of the sixth
generation will become a Brāhmaṇa (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana)
