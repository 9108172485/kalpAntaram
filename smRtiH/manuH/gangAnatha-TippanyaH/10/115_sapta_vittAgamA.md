‘*Lābhaḥ*’.—‘Friendly present’ (Medhātithi, Govindaraja and
Kullūka);—‘acquisition of treasure-trove’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

‘*Jayaḥ*’.—‘Conquest in war’ (Medhātithi);—‘winning law-suits’
(Nandana).

‘*Prayogaḥ*.’—‘Money-lending,’ (Medhātithi);—‘Teaching’ (bandana).

‘*Karmayogaḥ*.’—‘Trade and agriculture’ (Medhātithi);—‘Sacrificing for
others’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 309), which adds
the following explanations:—‘*Āyaḥ* (*Dā*yaḥ**?)’, ancestral
property,—‘*lābhaḥ*,’ finding of a treasure-trove;—inheriting ancestral
property, finding of treasure-trove and purchase are for all the four
castes, ‘conquest’ is for the Kṣatriya alone,—‘*prayoga*’ is lending
money on interest,—and ‘*karmayoga*’ is trade and agriculture;—these two
are for the Vaiśya only;—and ‘acceptance of gifts from righteous
persons’ is for the Brāhmaṇa only.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Vyavahāra, p. 330);—in *Smṛtitattva*
II (p. 350), which adds the following notes:—‘*Dāya*’ is inheritance of
ancestral property,—‘*lābha*’ is finding of treasure-trove and such
tilings,—‘*jaya*’ is conquest of war,—‘*prayoga*’ is
money-lending,—‘*karmayoga*’ is trade, agriculture, sons and
daughters;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* II (p. 245);—in *Mitākṣarā* (2.113);—in
*Hemādri* (Śrāddha, p. 525);—in *Hemādri* (Dāna, p. 41), which explains
‘*prayoga*’ as ‘monetary transaction for earning interest,’ and
‘*karmayoga*’ as ‘officiating as priests at sacrifices’;—and in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika 37a).
