p. 422);—in *Aparārka* (p. 934), where it is pointed out that this
refers to a Brāhmaṇa who has not performed the requisite expiatory
rites;—again on p. 1046;—in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 353)—in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 232);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 124);—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika
36b) and in *Prāyaścittaviveka* (p. 427), which says that only strong
deprecation is what is meant
