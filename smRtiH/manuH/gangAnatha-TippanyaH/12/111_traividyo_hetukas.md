This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (3.301) as describing the
constitution of the Assembly or Court; it adds the following
notes:—‘*Haitukaḥ*’, who is conversant with the essential principles of
the Mimānsā,—‘*tarkī*,’ who is expert in the science of reasoning;—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 77 4), which adds the following notes:—‘*Hetukaḥ*’
(which is its reading for ‘*haitukaḥ*’), expert, in
inference;—‘*tarkī*’, one who is expert in ‘*Tarka*’, which is the name
given to that process of reasoning by which one comes to the correct
conclusion on a definite question, by rejecting all other possible
alternatives; the ‘*tarka*’ ‘argumentation’ meant here is one that does
not go against the Vedic scriptures.

It is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 199), which adds the following
notes—‘*Traividyaḥ*’, one who knows the three Vedas,—‘*haitukaḥ*’, one
who acts in a reasonable manner;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 22).
