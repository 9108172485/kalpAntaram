‘*Ajñebhyaḥ*’.—‘Entirely ignorant’ (Medhātithi and Nārāyaṇa), ‘who have
not read the Veda’ (Nandana),—‘who have learnt a little’ (Govindarāja
and Kullūka).

‘*Granthinaḥ*’.—‘Forgetful students’ (Kullūka and Nandana),—‘those who
learn the verbal text alone and do not ponder, over the meaning’,
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛtitattva* II (p. 73), which adds the
following notes:—‘*Granthinaḥ*,’ who can read only with the help of the
book,—‘*Dhāriṇaḥ*,’ who can read without the help of the
book,—‘*Jñāninaḥ*,’ who have studied the scriptures and know their
meaning.
