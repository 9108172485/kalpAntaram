‘*Śrutipratyakṣahetavaḥ*’—‘Those who have learnt the Vedic text, also
facts of perception and reasonings’, *or* ‘those for whom the
perceptible Vedic texts are the sole means of discriminating virtue and
vice’ (Medhātithi);—‘who are the cause of the teaching of the subjects
perceptible in the Veda’ (Govindarāja),—‘who are the causes of making
the revealed texts perceptible by reciting them’ (Kullūka);—‘those for
whose knowledge and exposition of the Law, the causes consist of Hearing
and Perception by the senses’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 6) as defining the
‘*Śiṣṭa*.’
