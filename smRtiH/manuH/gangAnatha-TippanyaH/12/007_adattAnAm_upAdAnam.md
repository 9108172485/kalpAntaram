This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 692); in *Aparārka* (p.
998), which adds that the ten kinds of sinful acts, proceeding from the
mind, speech and body, when committed intentionally and repeatedly,
should be understood to be what leads to the map being born in such
bodies as those of the *Cāṇḍāla* and the like; but of, the same kinds of
acts, when done unintentionally, the results are different;—in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Prāyaścitta 41a);—in *Hemādri* (Kāla, p. 632);—and in
*Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p. 88).
