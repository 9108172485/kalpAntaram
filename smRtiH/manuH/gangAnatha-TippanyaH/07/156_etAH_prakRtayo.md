“The eight other constituents are, according to Kāmandakī 8.16-17, (*a*)
in front beyond the foe’s territory—(1) a friend, (2) the foe’s friend,
(3) the friend’s friend (4) the foe’s friends, friend;—(*b*) in the
roar—(1) he who attacks in the rear, (2) he who restrains the latter,
(3) and (4) the supporters of these two.”—Buhler.

The first half of this verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p.
320), where also the above eight are mentioned.
