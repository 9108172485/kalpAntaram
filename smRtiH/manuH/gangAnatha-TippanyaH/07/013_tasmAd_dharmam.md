This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 23), which adds the following
notes:—Inasmuch as the king is the centre of all lustre and power, one
should never transgress any lawful and fair commands that his majesty
may issue in regard to his minister, priest or other favourites;—such
commands for instance as—‘To-day should be observed by all the people as
a day of rejoicing, there is a marriage in the minister’s house, all
should be present there, butchers shall kill no animals today, no birds
are to be caught, no debtors are to be imprisoned by their creditors’
and so forth \[these in regard to the king’s favourites.\]—Similarly in
regard to one whom he dislikes, he may issue such orders as—‘none shall
associate with him, he should not be permitted to enter any household,’
and so forth.—Such rules promulgated by the king should not be
disobeyed. In regard to the performance of the *Agnihotra* and such
religious acts, however, the king has no right to interfere at all.

This verse is quoted also in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 42b).
