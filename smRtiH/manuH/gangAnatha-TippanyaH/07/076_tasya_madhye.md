‘*Sarvartukam*’—‘Provided with the produce of all seasons’ (Medhātithi,
Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘habitable in all seasons’
(Nandana and Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 407);—and in
*Nītimayūkha* (p. 65), which explains ‘*sarvartukam*’ as ‘with gardens
containing trees of fruits of all seasons, or stocked with fruits and
flowers of all seasons’,—and ‘*sarvavastusamanvitam*’ as ‘stocked with
things needed in several seasons’.
