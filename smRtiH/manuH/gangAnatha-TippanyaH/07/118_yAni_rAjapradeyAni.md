This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 250), which
explains the meaning to be that the ‘lord of the village’ should receive
for his living only the food, drink and fuel and such other things as
are due to be presented to the king,—and not the annual rent;—this
annual rent being realised by the king himself through a trusted
official.
