This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 3.44);—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 408);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 141), which
remarks that though this verse mentions the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ in general, yet
from what follows in the next verse it is clear that what the text means
is to speak of only the *learned* Brāhmaṇa.
