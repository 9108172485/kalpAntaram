**(verse 7.184)**

‘*Upagṛhyāspadam*’—‘Having won over the disaffected servants of the
enemy’ (Govindarāja, Kullūka and Rāghavānanda);—‘having established a
camp in the enemy’s country’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 396), which adds the following
notes—‘*mūle*’, ‘at the base, in his own kingdom’—‘*vidhānam*’,
‘measures for defending, such as garrisoning and so forth.’

**(verse 7.185)**

‘*Ṣaḍvidham balam*’—‘(1) Elephants, (2) horses, (3) chariots, (4)
foot-soldiers, (5) army-treasury, (6) labourers; or (1) the *maula* (2)
*bhṛtya*, (3) *śreṇī*, (4) *mitra*, (5) *amitra* and (6) *āṭavika*;
(Medhātithi);—the latter enumeration is found in Kāmandaka, 16.6, which
is adopted by Nandana.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 396), which explains ‘*ṣaḍvidham balam*’
as consisting of the *maula*, the *bhṛtaka* and so forth,’—and
‘*Sāmparāyikakalpena*’ as ‘in accordance with the rules of war’.
