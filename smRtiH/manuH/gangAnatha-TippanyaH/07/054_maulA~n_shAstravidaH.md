‘*Labdhalakṣān*’—‘Experienced’ (Medhātithi);—‘who fail not in their
undertakings’ (Govindarāja, Nandana and Rāghavānanda);—‘skilled in the
use of weapons.’

‘*Suparīkṣitān*’—‘Tried through temptations’ (Medhātithi);—‘tried as to
incorruptibiliy’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘tested by spies’ (Govindarāja);—‘bound to
fidelity by oath, by touching the images of gods and such sacred objects
(Kullūka and Rāghavānandà).

This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.311) to the effect that the
king should appoint seven or eight councillors;—in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra p. 405);—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 177), which explains,
‘*labdhalakṣān*’ as ‘*paridṛṣtakarmaṇaḥ*’, ‘who have seen action’,
*i.e*., ‘experienced’;—in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 61), which explains
‘*labdhalakṣān*’ as ‘clever’,—‘*maulān*’ as ‘hereditary’;—and in
*Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 9b).
