*Cf*. Kāmandakīya Nītisāra, 8.14, 18.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 320), which adds
the following notes:—In the ‘circle’ of kings, there are four kinds of
kings—(1) The king seeking conquest (2) the three kinds of enemy—the
natural enemy, the artificial enemy and the neighbouring state, (3) the
middle state, which is capable of defeating either of the two parties to
a conflict, taken singly (4) the neutral, who is capable of smashing any
one of the above three.

This verse is quoted in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 36a).
