This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 250), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Anuparikrāmāt*’ *i.e*., wherever the lawful
people are being oppressed by unlawful people, he should strengthen the
former with his own forces;—‘*vṛttam*’ means ‘behaviour’;—‘*pariṇayet*’
means ‘report’; ‘*taccaraiḥ*,’ ‘through the king’s agents.’
