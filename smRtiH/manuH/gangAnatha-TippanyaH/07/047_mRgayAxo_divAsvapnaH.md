This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 413);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 147), which explains ‘*parivādaḥ*’ as
‘describing the defects of other persons—‘*vṛthāṭyā*’ as ‘listless
wandering,’—and ‘*tauryatrikam*’ as ‘dancing, singing and music’;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Lakṣaṇa, p. 198);—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.310);—in
*Smṛtitattva* (p. 717), which explains ‘*tauryatrikam*’ as ‘dancing,
singing and music’;—and again on p. 742, where ‘*akṣa*’ is explained as
‘gambling.’
