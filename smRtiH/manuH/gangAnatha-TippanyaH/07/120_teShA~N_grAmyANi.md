‘*Pṛthakkāryāṇi*’—‘Quarrels among each other’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘the separate
affairs of the villagers’ (Nandana),

‘*Snigdhaḥ*’—‘Impartial’ (Medhātíthī);—‘loyal to the king’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 249), which
explains ‘*pṛthakkāryāṇi*’ as ‘quarrels among themselves’;—it notes that
if we adopted the reading ‘*pṛthakkāyāni*,’ the meaning would be
‘matters on which there is a difference of opinion among them.’
