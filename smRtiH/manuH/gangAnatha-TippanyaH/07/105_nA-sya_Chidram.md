This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 117), which adds
the following explanation:—He should try his best to keep his weak
points from being known by the enemy, and yet he himself should find out
the weak points of the enemy, such as disaffection among the people and
so forth; just as the tortoise hides within its body its head and other
limbs, in the same manner should he always keep won over to his side, by
bestowing gifts and honours, his own ministers and other officers of
state; and if, by chance, some disaffection should happen to arise among
his people, he should take remedial measures at once.
