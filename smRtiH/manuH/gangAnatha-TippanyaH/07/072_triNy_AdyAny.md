**(verse 7.71)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 203), which
explains ‘*bāhuguṇyena*’ as ‘by reason of its having many apparent
advantages, such as inaccessibility and so forth’;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda*
(Saṃskāra p. 72a);—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 65), which says that the
genitive in ‘*eteṣam*’ (which is its reading for ‘*eṣām hi*)’ denotes
*selection*.

**(verse 7.72)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 202), which adds
the following explanations:—From among the first three kinds of fort,
wild animals take shelter in the fort consisting of the desert,—‘animals
living in holes,’ *i.e*., rats take shelter in the fort consisting of
the ground, fish take shelter in the ‘fort’ consisting of unfordable
water;—monkeys take shelter in trees, which constitute their ‘fort’;—and
man takes shelter under men, who constitute his ‘fort’,—and the gods
take shelter on mountain-peaks, like the Kailāśa. What is meant is that
‘just as the gods and others take shelter under the defences of the
Kailasha peak and so forth, so should the king take shelter in a fort.
