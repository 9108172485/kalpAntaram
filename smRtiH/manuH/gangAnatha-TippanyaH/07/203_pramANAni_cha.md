This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 410), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Teṣām*,’ ‘of the other king,’—‘*yathoditān*,’ ‘as
handed down by his family-traditions,’—‘*dharmān*,’ ‘practices,
customs,’—these he should make the ‘*pramāṇāni*’, the *authority*, by
way of oath, *i.e*., he should administer the oath in such words as—‘if
you act contrary to this compact of yours, you fall off from such and
such high morality and custom handed down by your family-traditions.’—It
suggests also another explanation of the verse as as follows—‘*Teṣām*,’
‘of the former king’—‘*yathoditān dharmān*,’ ‘the administrative
measures taken for the grant of livings to Brāhmaṇas, ministers and
others,’—these he should ‘*pramāṇani kurvīta*,’ ‘declare to be
inviolable.’

It is quoted in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 73b).
