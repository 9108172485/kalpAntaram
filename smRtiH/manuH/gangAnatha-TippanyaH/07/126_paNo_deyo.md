Kullūka);—‘512 *palas*’ (Govindarāja).

six times as much grain and clothes as the lowest, and the middle class
servants three times as much as the lowest”—Buhler.

the following notes:—‘*Avakṛṣṭasya*,’ ‘of domestic
servants’;—‘*vetanam*,’ fooding,—‘*āchādaḥ*’, ‘two pieces of
clothing’,—‘*droṇaḥ* ‘four ‘*Āḍhakas*’;—and in *Śuddhikaumudī* (p. 240).
