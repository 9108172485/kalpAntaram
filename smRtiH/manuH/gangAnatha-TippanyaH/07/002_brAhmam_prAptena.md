‘*Saṃskāram*’—‘*Upanayana*, Initiation’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa);—‘Sacrament of Coronation’ (Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 11), in support of
the view that it is the *Kṣatriya* alone whose function it is to protect
the people; and it adds the following notes:—‘*Brahma*’ is *Veda*; and
the ‘*saṃskāra*,’ ‘embellishment,’ ‘aptitude,’ brought about by the
learning, proper study and due understanding of the Veda is called
‘*brāhma*’)—or the ‘*saṃskāra*’ ‘initiation,’ which is undergone for the
purpose of learning the ‘Brahma’ or Veda, is called the ‘*brāhma
saṃskāra*,’ *i.e*., the *Upanayana*;—‘*yathāvidhi*’ means ‘in accordance
with the scriptures;’—this is an adverb modifying ‘*prāptena*’;
‘*yathānyāyam*’ means ‘in strict accordance with the law relating to the
infliction of punishment, going to be set forth
below’;—‘*parirakṣaṇam*,’ ‘guarding the weak against oppression by the
strong.’ This verse shows that the function of *Kingship* belongs
primarily to the *Kṣatriya*.

It is quoted in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 1), which explains ‘*brāhmam
saṃskāram*’ as ‘the anointing done by the Brāhmaṇas.’
