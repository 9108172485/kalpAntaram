This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), as
describing the results proceeding from doing what is prescribed in the
preceding verse; it adds the notes that ‘even though the king be already
well-disciplined, yet he should learn discipline further, for the
purpose of securing greater efficiency.’
