This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646), which explains
*jāgarti* as ‘being awake’ in the sense that it serves the purpose of
freeing men from all fear of thieves and other mischief-makers;—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261),
which says that ‘*jāgarti*’ means that he does the work of quelling
thieves, which can be done only by a wakeful and watchful person.
