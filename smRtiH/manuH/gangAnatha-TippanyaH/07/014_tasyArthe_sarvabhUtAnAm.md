This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p 393);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 283), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Tadartham*’ means ‘for the accomplishment of the king’s
purpose’; protecting of the people is the king’s duty, and as this
protecting cannot be done without punishment, it is punishment itself
that is called the ‘protection’ and it is eulogised by being styled
‘Dharma’ itself.—It is quoted again on p. 292.

The verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646), which adds the
following notes:—The merit arising from the protection of the people is
the king’s ‘*Artha*’ or ‘purpose’—for the sake of this the ‘Lord’,
Creator of the people, created punishment, which is ‘*brahmatejomayam*
(*brahmatejomaya*),’ the natural Power of Hiraṇyagarbha, and which is
‘Dharma’ itself, *i.e*., the consolidator of Dharma;—both these epithets
being purely valedictory and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261), which
explains ‘*tadartham dharmam*’ as for the purpose of establishing
Dharma;—and ‘*brahmatejomayam*’ as ‘constituted of the essence of
Hiraṇyagarbha’;—it adds that this is mere eulogy.

It is quoted also in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 37b).
