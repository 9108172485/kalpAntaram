‘*Akāle*’—This is taken by Medhātithi with the second clause and by
Govindarāja with the first.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 325) to the effect
that ‘war’ is of two kinds—(1) That undertaken for some special purpose
of one’s own—this being done either in the proper season, such as during
the months of November or December, or even out of season; and (2) that
undertaken for helping an ally who has been attacked by an enemy.
