This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, p. 410), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Abhīpsitānām*,’ ‘required by, the king selected
from among the family of the late king, and by his
ministers,’—‘*arthānām*,’ ‘of things,’—‘*ādānam*,’ ‘the taking
away,’—which is ‘*apriyakaram*,’—‘disagreeable,’—and ‘*dānam*’, ‘giving
away’—which is ‘*priyakārakam*’ to them;—in as much as it is only if he
were fully equipped with the necessary elephants, horses and wealth that
the new king could hope to be safe against other kings, the presentation
of such things at the time of installation is ‘*kāle yuktam*,’ ‘highly
opportune,’—and hence ‘*praśasyate*,’ ‘is commended.’
