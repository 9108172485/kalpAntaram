*Cf*. 9.303 *et seq*.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 17), which
adds the following:—Inasmuch as the king has been created out of their
essential portions, he is all these gods;—‘*dharmarāṭ*’ is Yama; the
meaning is that the king is similar to Agni and the other gods, being
created out of their portions:—‘*prabhāva*’ means ‘extraordinary power.’
