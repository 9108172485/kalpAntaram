This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 6);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18), which
adds the following notes:—When a man carelessly approaches too near the
fire, he himself alone is burnt, not his sons or other relations;—others
have explained ‘*durupasarpiṇam*’ as ‘one who approaches the fire for
the purpose of throwing himself into it, with a view to escape from
misery’;—better still than both these explanations is the following
one:—‘When a man, knowing himself to be guilty, proceeds, through
bravado, to touch Fire in an ordeal, it is he alone that is burnt by the
fire; but the king, becoming angry with him, destroys the man himself as
well as his son, brother and other members of the family, along with his
cattle and other possessions.’ It is thus alone that the two halves of
the verse become correlated.
