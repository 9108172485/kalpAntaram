This verse is quoted in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.310), which, reads
‘*ātmavidbhyo*’ (for ‘*ātmavidyām*’) and hence avoids the confusion felt
by the commentators on Manu;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 222), which
explains ‘*daṇḍanīti*’ as ‘*Arthaśāstra*’, ‘Science of
Polity’,—‘*vārtā*’ as ‘agriculture, commerce, cattle-tending and so
forth’,—and ‘*trayī*’ as ‘Ṛk, Yayuṣ and Sāman’;—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 118), which notes the reading ‘*vidyām*’, in which case,
it says, the whole is to be construed with ‘*adhigaccet*’ of verse
39;—in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Āhnika, p. 36a);—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p.
6a).
