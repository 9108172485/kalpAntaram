**(verse 7.162)**

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 325), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Sandhi*,’ ‘alliance’, is of two kinds—(1) the
compact that ‘both of us should march against a common enemy’, and (2)
the compact that ‘you march this way, I march the other way’;—‘War’ also
is of two kinds—(1) declared by one’s self against an enemy, and (2)
undertaken for helping an ally attacked by an enemy;—‘Marching’ also is
of two kinds—(1) singly, and (2) conjointly with an ally; ‘Halting’ also
is of two kinds—(1) done on account of weakness and (2) done for the
purpose of waiting to help an ally;—‘Division of forces’ is of two
kinds—(1) the king remaining with half the force in the fort and the
Commander-in-chief going out to meet the enemy and (2) the reverse
arrangement;—‘Seeking protection’ also is of two kinds—(1) done for the
rescuing of what has been lost and (2) done for awaiting future
aggression.

**(verse 7.163)**

Nārāyaṇa and Nandana take the term ‘*tadā tvāyatisaṃyuktaḥ*’ as
referring to two different cases,—‘yielding either (*a*) immediate, or
(*b*) future advantages.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 325) to the effect
that the two kinds of ‘alliance’ spoken of above (see preceding note)
are each again of two kinds, as leading to (*a*) immediate advantage or
(*b*) future advantage.
