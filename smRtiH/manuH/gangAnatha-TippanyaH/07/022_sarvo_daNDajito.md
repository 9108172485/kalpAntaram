This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 286), which adds
the explanation that it is difficult to have any one pure by his very
nature; in most cases it is only through fear of punishment that people
are kept on the right path.—It is quoted again on p. 292;—and in
*Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263).
