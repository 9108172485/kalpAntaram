This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392); in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 6);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Kāryam*’ means ‘fitness for being pardoned
or punished’,—‘*śakti*’ is ‘capacity’,—‘*deśa*’ means ‘remoteness or
proximity’,—‘*kālam*’ refers to times of scarcity or opulence;—having
considered all this, he assumes various forms;—*i*. *e*., in a moment he
is pleased, and in a moment displeased; when he finds a man weak, he
becomes forgiving and if the man is strong, he uproots him, *i.e*., he
assumes a friendly, inimical or disinterested attitude in accordance
with the considerations of state.
