‘*Padmā*’—‘Carrying a lotus in her hand’ (Nārāyaṇa);—‘dwelling in the
lotus (Rāghavānanda);—‘the great, the magnificent’ (Medhātithi,
Govindārāja and Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 18) which adds the following notes:—When a
man seeks for fortune, or having an enemy seeks to destroy him,—or seeks
for livelihood,—he has recourse to the king;—Medhātithi and others have
remarked that the term ‘*padmā*’ being a synonym of ‘*Śrī*’, is added
for the purpose of indicating *greatness*; that is to say, the term
‘*padmā*’ is superfluous;—in reality however it is ‘*padmā*’ that stands
as a name for the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, and the term ‘*śrīḥ*’
stands for ‘bodily splendour or we may construe the words as
follows:—‘In whose favours rests Padmā, the goddess of fortune, and in
whose valour rest resplendence (*śriḥ*) and victory (*vijayaḥ*).’
