‘*Viṣamaḥ*’—‘Irascible’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda);—‘partial’ (Nārāyaṇa).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 647), which explains
‘*samyak*’ as ‘with due deliberation,’—‘*kāmātmā*’ as ‘one who acts just
as he pleases’—and ‘*Viṣamaḥ*’ as ‘adopting the wrong course by reason
of partiality;’—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*’ (p. 262), which explains
‘*Kāmātmā*’ as ‘if the king acts as he pleases,’ and ‘*Viṣamaḥ*’ as
‘acting wrongly through partiality or prejudice.’
