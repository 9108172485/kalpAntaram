‘*Yoyakṣemam*’—‘Charges incurred for security of property against
royalty and thieves and robbers’ (Medhātithi);—‘net profits (*yoga*) and
charges for securing the goods against robbers &c.’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 259), which adds
the following notes:—What has been paid for the cloth, salt and other
articles of merchandise? What are likely to be the profits from selling
them? From what distance has all this been brought? What quantity of
food and vegetables and condiments have been spent by the man in
importing the goods? How much he has lost over the charges incurred in
securing his goods against robbers and other dangers of the journey?
What is the profit he is actually making? What is he spending over the
guarding of his merchandise against robbers and thieves?—the King should
take into consideration all this and then fix the taxes payable by the
traders.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404).
