The second half of this verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p.
262), which remarks that the option laid down is in view of the varying
fertility of the soil and the consequent greater or less labour involved
in cultivation; it explains ‘*dhānya*’ as standing for *Vrīhi*, *Yava*
and so forth and adds that what is here mentioned is to be realised only
from cultivators.
