This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 286), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Duṣyeyuḥ*’—‘men of the lower castes would have
intercourse with women of the higher ones and thus give birth to
improperly *mixed-castes* ’; and on this same account ‘all bounds of
propriety indicated by the scriptures would be broken down.’ It is
quoted again on p. 293;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263), which
explains ‘*vibhrama*’ as ‘non-infliction’ or ‘wrong infliction’ (of
punishment).
