The second half of this verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
410);—the entire verse in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 159),—and again
on p. 317, where the following notes are added—‘*Teṣām*,’ stands for
‘Dharma’—Artha—Kāma’, among whom, in most cases, there is
conflict;—‘*samupārjanam*,’ means ‘attainment, in the proper manner,
*i.e*., the attainment of one or the other out of the three, without
detriment to the other two factors.’
