The order of verses 128 and 129 of Medhātithi is reversed in the other
commentaries and hence by Buhler and Burnell.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 260), which adds the following
notes:—‘*Adanti*’, ‘eat’;—‘*ādyam*,’ ‘what is fit for eating, *i.e*.,
blood, milk and honey’;—‘*vāryoko-vatsa-ṣaṭpadāḥ*,’ ‘the leech, the calf
and the bee’;—in the same manner should the king draw from his kingdom
only a small amount of annual revenue, so that the principal capital of
the people may not be affected.
