This verse occurs also in the *Mahābhārata*.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 17), to the
effect that by showing disrespect to the king one incurs the same sin
that he does by showing disrespect towards the gods.
