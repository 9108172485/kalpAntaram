This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), which adds
the following notes:—‘*vṛddhān*’ as ‘advanced in age, be they Brāhmaṇas
or non-Brāhmaṇas’;—‘*viprān*’ and ‘*vedavidaḥ*’ have been already
explained ‘*śucīn*’ is ‘free from guile’;—Medhātithi adds that this
qualification also is one that has not been mentioned elsewhere; but
Kullūka Bhaṭṭa holds that all the rest are only qualifications of
‘*viprān*’ \[so that Brāhmaṇas alone are meant\];—the meaning of the
second line is that ‘the king is respected also by those reckless,
merciless ruffians who are devoid of all virtues, not say by ordinary
people.’
