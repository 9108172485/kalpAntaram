This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—in the same
work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 16); which
adds the the following explanation:—‘By his lustre he burns, like the
Sun, the eyes and minds of the people that look at him’; though the verb
‘*tapati*’ is in the simple form, it has the sense of the causal; what
is said here is based on the idea that people cannot look the king in
the face; this is the purport of the second half of the verse, which
means that ‘no one on earth can look the king straight in the face.’—It
proceeds—“Medhātithi has remarked that even Brāhmaṇas, who are of
superior caste, and who are endowed with Brahmic glory, cannot look him
in the face”; and he bases this assertion on the words of Gautama (11.7)
that ‘people should sit below the king who sits on high’. This however
is not right, since Gautama has followed up his assertion with the
saving clause ‘*anye brāhmaṇebhyaḥ enam manyeran*’, so that what the
complete *sūtra* of Gautama means is—‘while the king is sitting high
upon the throne, people should sit below, on the ground,—all except the
Brāhmaṇas, and these latter should honour him with benedictions.’
