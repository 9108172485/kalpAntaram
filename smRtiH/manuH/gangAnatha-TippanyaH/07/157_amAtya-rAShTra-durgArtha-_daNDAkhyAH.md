This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 323), which
enumerates the 72 as consisting of the (1) conquering king, (2) his
minister, (3) his kingdom, (4) his fortress, (5) his treasury, (6) his
army;—and so with each of the other eleven states of the ‘Circle’; this
*twelve* times *six* makes 72.
