**(verse 7.116)**

“This rule refers to offences with which the persons who report them are
unable to deal (according to Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Rāghavānanda); Nārāyaṇa thinks that chiefly refusals to pay the revenue
or disputes on such matters are meant”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 250).
