This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 392);—again in the
same work (Vyavahāra, p. 5);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 16),
which adds the following notes:—‘*Eṣām surendrāṇām*’—‘these principal
gods, Indra and the rest’;—‘*mātrābhyaḥ*’—‘the king has been created
after extracting the most essential portions out of the constituent
portions of the said deities; for this reason in glory, he surpasses all
beings, *i.e*., he is superior to all things.’
