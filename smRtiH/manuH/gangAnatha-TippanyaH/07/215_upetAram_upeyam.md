‘*Upetāram*’—‘The employer of the means, *i.e*., the king himself’
(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda);—‘the
king’s minister’ (Nandana).

‘*Āśritya*’—‘Undertaking’ (Medhātithi);—‘depending upon’ (Govindarāja
and Kullūka);—‘pondering over’ (Nārāyaṇa and Raghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 413), which
explains ‘*upetāram*’ as ‘the employer of the means, *i.e*., the king
himself,’—and ‘*upeyam*’ as ‘one who is to be won by the means employed,
*i.e*., the enemy’—again, on p. 319, where also the explanations are
repeated;—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 50).
