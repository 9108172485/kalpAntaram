This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 404);—and in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 260), which adds the following
explanation:—The king should impose taxes in such a manner that he
himself gets some reward for what he does in the shape of seeming safety
to life and property, and also the transactors of business—the
cultivator, the trader and others—idso obtain a fair return for the work
that they do, in the shape of tilling the soil, trading and so
forth;—again on p. 264, to the effect that the taxes may be enhanced or
reduced in consideration of the loss or gain actually accruing to the
people concerned.
