This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647), which explains
‘*mūḍhena*’ as ‘devoid of right imagination’,—and ‘*akṛtabuddhinā*’ as
‘one who has not learnt the scriptures’;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p.
262), which explains ‘*mūḍhena*’ as ‘Licking imagination,’—and
‘*akṛtabuddhinā*,’ as ‘ignorant of the scriptures.’
