‘*Bhogāya kalpante*’—‘Become capable of providing enjoyment’
(Medhātithi);—‘are enabled to enjoy’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 646);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 284), which adds the following notes:—‘*Tasya*’, ‘of the
punishment;’—*Question*: “Punishment, a source of fear, should have
ended in the Ablative”.—The answer to this is that all that is meant to
be expressed is *relationship in general* (and not the fact of being a
source of fear); that is why we have the Genitive.—It is quoted again on
p. 292;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 261).
