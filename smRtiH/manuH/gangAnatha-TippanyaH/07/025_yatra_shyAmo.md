This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara*, (p. 646), which adds the
following explanation:—‘In the kingdom where the dark-complexioned
red-eyed Personification of Punishment is active, the people
prosper,—provided that the administrator, the ruler, judges
rightly’;—and in *Vivādacintāmāṇi* (p. 261), which explains
‘*netā......paśyati*’, ‘if the administator of justice judges rightly.’
