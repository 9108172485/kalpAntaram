This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 648), which explains
‘*daṇḍya*’ as ‘one who deserves punishment’;—in *Virāmitrodaya*
(Rājanīti, p. 292),—and also on p. 284, where the following explanation
is added:—Just as people eat fish after cooking it on the spit, so would
the strong injure the weak and take away their riches and other
belongings;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263), which explains
‘*daṇḍyeṣu*’ as ‘those deserving punishment’.
