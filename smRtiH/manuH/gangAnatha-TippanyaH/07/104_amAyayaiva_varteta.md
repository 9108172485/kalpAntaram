Buhler remarks that “Medhātithi reads *atandritaḥ*,” but there is
nothing in *Bhāṣya* to indicate this.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 134), which
explains ‘*amāyayā*’ as ‘without guile’, ‘*varteta*,’ as ‘should behave
*i*.*e*., towards his counsellors and others’;—and in *Parāśaramādhava*
(Ācāra, p. 413).
