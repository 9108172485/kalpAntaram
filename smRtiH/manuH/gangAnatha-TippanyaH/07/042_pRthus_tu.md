“Pṛthu (*cf*. 9.44) was the title of several gods as well as kings. The
one meant is probably he whose happy reign is described in the 7th and
12th books of the Mahābhārata. Manu needs only an exclamation \[Hopkins
evidently forgets (1) that the person speaking is not *Manu* himself,
and (2) that there have been several Manus\]. ‘Kubera was god of wealth
and Gādhi’s son was Viśvāmitra who was born a Kṣatriya.”—Hopkins.

Gharpure refers to the Mahābhārata, Śāntiparva (58-107) and Bhāgavata
(4-13, 145).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 120).
