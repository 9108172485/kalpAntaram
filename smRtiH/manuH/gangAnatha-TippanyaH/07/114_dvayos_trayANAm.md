This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 248), which
supplies the following explanation:—In the midst of two hundred, or
three hundred, of five hundred villages, he should establish an outpost,
containing a detachment of infantry and others;—if we read ‘*rāṣṭrasya
saṅgraham*’ (in place of ‘*rāṣṭrasya guptaye*) the meaning would be that
he should establish a *saṅgraha*, *i.e*., a ‘guard’ consisting of a
‘*gulma*’ an outpost, and ‘*avasthita*’ supervised by honest
officers.—The option regarding the extent of each charge is based upon
the diversity in the strength of robbers and other mischief-makers in
varying areas.
