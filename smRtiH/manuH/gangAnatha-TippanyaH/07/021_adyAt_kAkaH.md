This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 648), which explains
‘*adharottaram*’ as ‘subversion of the natural order of superiority and
inferiority;’—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292);—and in
*Vīvādacintāmaṇi* (p. 263), which explains ‘*adharottaram*’ as ‘the
reversal of all standards of superiority and inferiority.’
