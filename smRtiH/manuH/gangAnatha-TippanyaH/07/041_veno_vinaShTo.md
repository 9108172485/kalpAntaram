“Vena is often taken as a type of an undisciplined king. He was the son
of Sunīthā and father to Pṛthu......Nahuṣa, son of Āyuṣ (the Mahābhārata
I and V), was ruined by love and ambition... Sudās was king at the time
of the great Vaśiṣṭha, and a leader of the Tṛtsu (Ṛgveda VII. 18)...
Sumukha is unknown to me. Nimi is said to be a Videha king”—Hopkins.

Gharpure notes the following references to the *Mahābhārata*;—(1)
Droṇaparva (69);—(2) Śāntiparva (28-137, 58-102);—(3) Ādiparva (63-5,
69-29);—(4) Udyogaparva (101-12);—(5) Bhīṣmaparva (6-14);—(6)
Sabhā-parva (8-9). These are meant to refer respectively to the six
kings mentioned in the text.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 119), which notes
that Sudāsa was the son of Paijavana.
