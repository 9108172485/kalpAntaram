‘*Karmānta*’—‘*Bhakṣya-kārpāsāvāpādayaḥ*’, ‘Food stuffs, cotton fabrics,
utensils and so forth’ or ‘sowing of seeds of food-grains and cotton
etc.’ (Medhātithi, to whom Buhler, on the strength of his own Mss.,
attributes the explanation ‘sugar-mills, distilleries and so
forth’);—‘store-houses of sugarcane, grains and such things’ (Kullūka).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 187), which adds
the following notes:—*Teṣām*, ‘from among the said
assistants’;—‘*arthe*,’ ‘in the work of collecting revenue’; which is
further explained by the term ‘*ūkarakarmānta*’;—‘*bhīrūn*’, ‘those who
are full of fear of this world as well as of the next’

It is also quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 581);—and in *Nītimayūkha* (p. 53),
which explains ‘*ākara*’ as ‘mines of gold and other
metals’,—‘*karmānta*’ as ‘*granaries*’,—and ‘*antarniveśana*’ as ‘the
bed-room and other private apartments,’ and adds that there should be
‘*bhīru*’, cowards, as brave men might kill the king.
