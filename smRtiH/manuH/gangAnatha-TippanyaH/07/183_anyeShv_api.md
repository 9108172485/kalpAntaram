*Cf*. Kāmandaka, 11.3.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 401);—in
*Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 330), to the effect that the ‘enemy’s
difficulty’ being itself laid down as affording the best opportunity for
marching against him, there is no room for any other consideration;—and
in *Smṛtitattva* (p. 742) to the same effect.
