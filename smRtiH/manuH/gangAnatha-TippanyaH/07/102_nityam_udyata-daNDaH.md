*Nityamudyatadaṇḍaḥ syāt*’—‘Should keep his army fit by constant
exercise’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—‘should be always ready
to strike’ (Nārāyaṇa and Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya*, (Rājanīti, pp. 133-134), which
adds the following notes:—‘*Udyatadaṇḍaḥ*’—‘daṇḍa’ here stands for the
training and exercise of the elephants, horses and other compliments of
the army; and this should be ‘*udyata*’, ever active, ready;—or
‘*daṇda*’ may stand for ‘punishment of the wicked,’ and this should be
‘*udyata*’, always inflicted in time.—‘*Vivṛtapauruṣaḥ*’—he whose
‘*pauruṣa*’ *manliness*, *i.e*., superiority in the knowledge and use of
weapons, is ‘*vivṛta*,’ *displayed*;—‘*sambṛtasaṃvāryaḥ*’—he whose
secrets, *i.e*., councils, appearances and operations, are kept unknown
to others.
