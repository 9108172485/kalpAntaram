‘*Sthānam*’—‘Halting’ (Nandana).—Buhler misrepresents Medhātithi when he
attributes to him the alternative explanation of *sthāna* as ‘loss of
his Kingdom’, in reality Medhātithi says ‘stability of the Kingdom’ as
rightly understood by Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Virāmitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 316), which adds
the following notes:—*Taiḥ*, ‘with the said councillors,—*chintayet*,
‘the. King should deliberate,’—*sandhiḥ*, ‘alliances’—*vigrahaḥ*,
‘declaration of war’,—*sthānam*, ‘consisting of the four factors of the
army, treasury, capital city and Kingdom’,—‘*samudayaḥ*,’ ‘agriculture,
pastures, outposts, traders, cattle, customs, fines and so
forth,’—*guptiḥ*, protection of his Kingdom,—*labdhapraśamanam*,
‘bestowing of honours and gifts upon temples, hermitages and learned
men’;—the meaning of the phrase *sāmānyam sandhivigraham* is that he
should discuss questions of peace and war in general, the detailed and
specific details being discussed in connection with the ‘*ṣāḍguṇya*.’

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 405) and in
*Rājanītiratnākara*;—(p. 10b).
