This verse is quoted in *Vivādaratnākara* (p. 647), which explains
‘*svadhṛtaḥ*’ (which is its reading for *sa dhṛtaḥ*) as ‘deservedly
inflicted’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 292) and also on p.
284;—and in *Vivādacintāmaṇi* (p. 262), which explains ‘*sudhṛtaḥ*’
(which is its reading for *sa dhṛtaḥ*) as ‘properly
administered,’—‘*samīkṣya*’ as ‘according to the scriptures’.
