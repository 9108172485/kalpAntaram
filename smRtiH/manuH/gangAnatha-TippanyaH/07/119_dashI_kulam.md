‘*Kulam*’—‘A portion of the village, known in some places as *ghaṭṭa*,
and in others as ‘*uṣṭa*’;—‘as much land as can be cultivated with two
ploughs’ (Kullūka);—‘as much as is cultivated by one cultivator’
(Nandana).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 251), which adds
the following notes:—‘*Kulam*’ is a portion of the village, called
‘*pādukā*,’ says *Kalpataru*:—others however hold that it stands for as
much land as can be cultivated by two ploughs. That much of land he
should have for his livelihood.
