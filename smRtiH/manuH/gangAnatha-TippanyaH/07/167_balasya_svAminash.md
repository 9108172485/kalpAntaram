“The text really mentions only one method of ‘Division.’ Hence
Medhātithi thinks that, in order to obtain the two kinds required, it
must be understood that the measure may be resorted to either for one’s
sake or for the sake of somebody else.—Nārāyaṇa makes the two methods
out by supposing that in the one case the army stops in front of the
enemy under the command of a general, while the king marches with a
portion of his forces, and that in the other case the contrary takes
place.—Govindarāja quotes Kāmandaki, 11.24, where a different meaning,
‘duplicity’ is attributed to the term ‘*dvaidhībhāva*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Rājanīti, p. 326) which
explains ‘*sthitiḥ*’ as ‘*dvidhābhūya sthitiḥ*’ ‘taking up a position
with forces divided,’ and adopts the explanation attributed (in the
above note) to Nārāyaṇa;—and in *Rājanītiratnākara* (p. 24b).
