It is ordained that the property of women married by the ‘Brāhma,’ the ‘Daiva,’ the ‘Ārṣa,’ the ‘Gāndharva,’ or the ‘Prājāpatya’ form, shall go to her husband alone, if she dies childless.—(196)


But the property given to a woman on the ‘Āsura’ or other (inferior) forms of marriage, has been held to belong to her parents, upon her dying childless.—(197)
