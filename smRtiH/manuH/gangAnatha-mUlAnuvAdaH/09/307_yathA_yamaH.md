As Vāyu moves about, entering all beings,—even so shall the king penetrate everywhere through his spies;—this is the function of Vāyu.—(306).


As Yama, at the approach of the proper time, restrains both friends and enemies, even so shall all men be restrained by the king; this is the function of Yama.—(307)
