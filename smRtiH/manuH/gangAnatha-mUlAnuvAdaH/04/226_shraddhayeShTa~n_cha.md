He shall always diliqenty perform, with faith, sacrifices and other religious acts; done with faith, and with well-begotten wealth, they become imperishable.—(226)


Of these, learning and austerities are the sources that bring presents. Though ‘present’ constitutes only one kind of wealth, yet it has been mentioned as two, on account of its twofold source. The qualifications of the persons making the gifts have also to be borne in mind. If the giver does not happen to be absolutely objectionable, the wealth derived from him is also pure.—The terms ‘person sacrificed for’ and ‘pupil’ indicate the work of officiating at sacrifices and teaching.—‘inherited,’ from one’s forefathers.—‘Bride,’ what is obtained from the Father-in-law, at the time of marriage.—‘Bravery’— for the Kṣatriya; while the ‘bride’ and ‘inheritance,’ are common to all men.


‘Service’ consists of running on errands and obeying orders; while ‘attendance’ is agreeable behaviour. Of these, ‘usury,’ ‘agriculture’ and ‘trade’ are mixed only for the non - Vaiśya; for the Vaiśya, these are commendable. Similarly, ‘service,’ consisting of attending upon twice-born men, is commendable for the Śūdra; the others are not commended for him. What is meant by these being ‘mixed’ is, that the results obtained from acts, performed with wealth derived from those sources, are transitory; these results lasting only during the present life.


‘Pārśvika,’—the man at one’s side, obtains wealth by means of bribery, etc. For instance, having come to know that a person is going to obtain some wealth, one goes over to him and says, ‘I shall get yon so much wealth, you should give me something out of it,’ and then receives it from him; the man not having done anything himself, nor having anything done by others, but simply looking on, and yet receiving money; or when one receives some consideration for standing surety for a borrower.—‘Pratirūpaka’ is pretence, hypocrisy .—‘Fraud’—when one sells the kusumbha flower, in place of saffron.—‘Ārti’ is causing pain to others.—‘Stealing’ is taking away things by stealth; and ‘robbery’ is taking away by force.
