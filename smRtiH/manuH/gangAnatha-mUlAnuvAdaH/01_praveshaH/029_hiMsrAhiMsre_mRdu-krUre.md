Each being, when created again and again, naturally conformed to that same act to which the lord had, at first, directed him.—(28)


“The meaning assigned to the verse does not appear to be its right meaning at all. What appears to be its right meaning is that the Creator is entirely independent in assigning their work to the creatures. The verse thus means as follows:—‘Every creature conformed to,—i.e., carried on—that same action—in the form either of doing harm to others, or its contrary,—to which the Lord had directed it at—at the beginning of creation’; that is, man does not have recourse to actions, cither entirely on the advice of his father and other elders, or by his own will; in fact, whatever good or bad action he performs, he does wholly in accordance with Prajāpati’s directions, entirely uninfluenced by the advice of any other person.


‘When created again’—i.e., when born again, whether in another cycle, or in this same cycle,—it is Prajāpati alone who directs all animate beings to be the doers of actions; hence even past good and bad acts arc done by them only in obedience to the directions of Prajāpati; this has been thus declared:—‘They become agents without being masters of their own actions; to the good or the bad act they are led on by God’; and again ‘this ignorant creature has no control over his pleasure and pain; it is only as led on by God that he goes to heaven or to hell.’”

हिंस्राहिंस्रे मृदुक्रूरे धर्माधर्मावृतानृते । 
यद् यस्य सो'दधात् सर्गे तत् तस्य स्वयमाविशत् ॥ २९ ॥


hiṃsrāhiṃsre mṛdukrūre dharmādharmāvṛtānṛte | 
yad yasya so'dadhāt sarge tat tasya svayamāviśat || 29 ||


Hurtfulness or harmlessness, tenderness or hard-heartedness, virtue or vice, truthfulness or truth-lessness,—each of these accrued to that being in which he implanted it at creation.—(29)
