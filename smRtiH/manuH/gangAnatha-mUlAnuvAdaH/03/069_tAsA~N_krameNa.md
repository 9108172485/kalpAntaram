Hence men who seek (their own) welfare, should always honour women on holidays and festivals with (gifts of) ornaments, clothes, and (dainty) food.—(59)

Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.
