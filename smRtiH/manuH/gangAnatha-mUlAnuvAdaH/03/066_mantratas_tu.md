But families that are rich in the knowledge of the Veda, though possessing little wealth, are numbered among the great, and acquire great fame.—(66)


Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.
