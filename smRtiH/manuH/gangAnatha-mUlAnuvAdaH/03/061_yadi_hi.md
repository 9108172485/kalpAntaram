For if the wife is not radiant with beauty, she will not attract her husband; but if she has no attractions for him, no children will be born.—(61)

Verses 57—66 are omitted by Medhātithi. [Query—are they interpolations?] “These are very probably a later addition. The corresponding section in the Mahābhārata, 13.46 stops right here also.”—Hopkins. They are all quoted in Vivādaratnākara and in Parāśaramādhava.
