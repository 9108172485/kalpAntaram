If a man does anything for his own benefit after death, to the detriment of the persons he has got to maintain,—it becomes conducive to unhappy results while he lives as also when he dies.—(9). Aged parents, well-behaved wife and infant sons have been declared by Manu to be persons that should be maintained, even by doing a hundred evil acts.—(10)


वृद्धौ च मातापितरौ साध्वी भार्या शिशुः सुतः | 
अप्यकार्यशतं कृत्वा भर्तव्या मनुरब्रवीत् ||


vṛddhau ca mātāpitarau sādhvī bhāryā śiśuḥ sutaḥ | 
apyakāryaśataṃ kṛtvā bhartavyā manurabravīt ||
