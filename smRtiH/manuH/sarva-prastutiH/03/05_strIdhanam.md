This verse prohibits the receiving ‘of consideration’ in connection with
the ‘Āsura’ form of marriage; that this is so, is indicated by the fact
that later on (in 54) the acceptance of a dowry for the bride is
permitted.

‘*Wise*’—*i.e*., knowing the impropriety of accepting the gift.

The girl’s father shall not accept even a small present; by accepting
it, he becomes tainted with the sin of child-selling.

“What is it that is called ‘*Śulka*,’ ‘consideration?’”

It is what is received from the bridegroom on stipulation. When there is
a bargaining, carried on in consideration of the good or bad qualities
of the bride,—it is a case of pure ‘selling;’ what is referred to here
is the acceptance of even a small present—though the bride is possessed
of most excellent qualities,—that also without any stipulation.

This (acceptance of unequal price) is not a condition of ‘sale’ proper;
the act is only deprecated by being described as being of the nature of
‘selling.’—(51)

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.21).—‘Those persons who, deluded by greed, give away
their daughters for a consideration, are soul-sellers, sinful and grave
sinners, and up to their seventh generation, they fall into hell.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.13.11).—‘In connection with marriage, a gift
to the girl’s guardian has been prescribed with a view to securing a
special end, and for a righteous purpose; therefore one should present
to the girl’s guardian a chariot and a hundred cows; which present joins
the couple in wedlock; the applying of the name *selling* to such giving
of the girl is a mere declamation; because the acceptance of the present
is for a righteous purpose.’

This verse is supplementary to the foregoing verse.

‘*Bride’s properties*’—*i.e*., those properties that are received from
the bridegroom for the sake of the bride; ‘*the relations*’—fathers and
others—‘*who, through folly, live upon*’ them;—as described above (in
verse 31)

‘The’ *property* here spoken, of is that in the form of gold and silver.

‘*Bride’s conveyances*’—such as the horse and the rest.

‘*Clothes*;’—even such paltry things as clothes and conveyances should
not be lived upon,—what to say of more valuable properties?

The text proceeds to describe what befalls those who do live upon such
properties,—they are ‘*sinners*—and by doing what is prohibited in the
scriptures—‘they *fall into the lowest state*’—*i.e*., into hell.

Or, ‘*bride’s properties*’ may be taken in the sense, in which it is
going to be described in Discourse 9 below. Those who, through folly,
live upon those properties;—the ‘*relations*,’ in this case, would stand
for the girl’s father and his kinsmen, as also the husband and his
relations. Similarly, with ‘conveyances’ and ‘clothes the ‘*clothes*’
also those belonging to the bride; this connection being assumed on the
basis of the proximity of the term ‘*bride*’ (in the compound term
‘bride’s conveyances’); just as in the case of the use of expression,
‘royal servant,’ if some one asks, ‘whose?,’—this is taken to mean ‘of
what *king*?’—(52)

‘*Bovine pair*’—*i.e*., a cow and a bull.

Some people declare that this ‘consideration’ should be accepted.

Manu’s opinion, however, is that ‘*this is not true*;’ *i.e*., it should

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 489), which adds
the following explanation:—The ‘*gomithuna*,’ ‘bovine pair,’ (given by
the bridegroom in the Ārṣa marriage) has been called by some people the
‘price’ paid for the girl;—but ‘*this is not true*,’—*i.e*., it cannot
be regarded as the ‘price’, as it does not posses that character; the
‘price’ of a thing is always an indefinite factor; as is found in every
sale-transaction, the price can never be definitely fixed; that which
suffices for buying a thing is called its ‘price’; and this varies with
time and place. In the present case, however, the amount is definitely
fixed; it is the ‘Ārṣa’ marriage when *only* the ‘cow-pair’ is given,
neither more nor less. Thus there being no real *buying* in this case,
the *Ārṣa* marriage must be regarded as lawful.

*Madanapārijāta* (pp. 155-156) takes the verse somewhat differently: It
says that if the ‘cow-pair’ given by the bridegroom is taken by the
bride’s father himself, then it is a clear case of ‘selling’ the girl;
but there would be nothing wrong if the present were accepted by him on
behalf of the bride, as is clear from the next verse.

*Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 849) quotes it in support of the view that
the ‘cow pair’ given in the *Ārṣa* marriage is not the ‘price’; though
it must come to be so regarded if it is taken through greed, as has been
made clear by Verse 51 above.

This verse is also quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 759) in support of
the view that the *Ārṣa* marriage involves no ‘selling’ of the girl,—and
it reproduces the arguments adduced by *Parāśaramādhava* (above).

It is quoted in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 479), which has the same note as
*Parāśaramādhava* (above); but makes things clear by reading ‘*Kriyate
tāvataiva saḥ*’, which lends itself to the desired interpretation much
more easily than the reading ‘*vikrayastāvadeva saḥ*,’ which calls the
transaction pure ‘selling’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra p. 231),
which explains ‘*mṛsā*’ as ‘false,’ and declares that the marriage is
unrighteous, in as much as it involves ‘selling’, the cow-pair being the
*price* and not mere *śulka* or ‘fee.’

The question being—“Does the mere act of receiving gifts from the
bridegroom make the marriage a *sale*?”—our answer is that it is not so;
it is when the ‘*relations*’ of the bride,—*i.e*., those in charge of
her—accept gifts for themselves, then alone it is ‘selling.’

‘*Means of honouring*’:—The receiving of presents on behalf of brides
becomes a means of honouring them; it raises the girls in their own
estimation; they come to think that ‘we are so good that we are being
married after receiving proper presents;’ they rise in the estimation of
the people also, who look upon such brides as very ‘handsomely
fortunate.’ Or, when out of the presents received ornaments are made for
them, and they are decked in them, they look beautiful.

‘*Harmless*’—it involves no sin; *i.e*., there is not the slightest
taint of sin in this act.

What this exaggerated statement indicates is that the accepting of
presents on behalf of the bride is permitted.—(54).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 850) in support of
the view that if the ‘cow-pair’ given by the bridegroom in the *Ārṣa*
marriage is accepted, not in greed,—then it is to be looked upon only as
a means of honouring the bride, and not as a ‘price’ paid for her. It
explains the word ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful.’

*Madanapārijāta* (p. 156) also quotes it in support of the view that if
the ‘cow-pair’ is accepted on behalf of the bride, there is nothing
wrong in it,—the verse being explained as follows—That ‘consideration’
which is accepted on behalf of the bride, constitutes the ‘honouring’ of
the girl, and as such is not sinful;—*i.e*., the ‘consideration’ thus
received should be handed over to the girl.

It is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 100), which explains
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘honest dealing’;—in *Saṃskā raratnamālā* (p. 479)
winch explains ‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’ as ‘not sinful—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 233), which explains the meaning as ‘what is received as
fee for the girl, that is only a *present* to the bride,’—and is
‘*ānṛśaṃsyam*’, ‘nothing sinful.’

The bride’s relations are not only to receive presents for her from the
bridegroom; they themselves shall make presents to her.

‘*Fathers*’—through association, the term ‘father’ here includes the
grandfather, uncle, etc., also; hence the plural number; or, the plural
number may be explained as referring to several individual brides.

Similarly, ‘*husbands*’ may stand for father-in-law, &c. or, it may
refer to several individual girls.

‘*Brothers-in-law*’—the husband’s brothers.

‘*Shall be honoured*’—during rejoicings in connection with the birth of
sons, &c., they should be invited, welcomed and received with honour and
feasting.

‘*Shall be adorned*’—should be decked with clothes, ornaments, unguents,
and so forth.

The effect of all this is next indicated—‘*welfare* what is desirable,
*i.e*., being endowed with children, wealth, &c., good health, freedom
from troubles, and so forth: Those who are desirous of all this—*i.e*.,
of obtaining all this (should do what is said above).

The injunction contained in this verse has been set forth for the
purpose of indicating this reward.—(55)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 506), in support of
the view that the wife, whether young or old—should always be respected,
‘worshipped’; but it adds that this does not apply to the *unchaste*
wife, for whom one should provide just enough to keep her body and soul
together.
