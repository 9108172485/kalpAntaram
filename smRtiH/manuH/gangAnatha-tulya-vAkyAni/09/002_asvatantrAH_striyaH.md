*Gautama* (18.1).—‘A wife is not independent with respect to the sacred
Law.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.44).—‘Women do not possess independence.’

*Vaśiṣṭha*( 5.1).—‘A woman is not independent; the males are her
masters.’

*Viṣṇu* (25.12).—‘Not to act by herself in any matter.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.85).—‘There is no independence for woman at any time.’

*Bṛhaspati* (24.2).—‘A woman must be restrained from even slight
transgressions by her relations,—by night and by day she must be watched
by her mother-in-law and other ladies of the family.

*Śukranīti* (4.4.11, 23).—‘Women have no separate right to the
employment of the means of realising the three ends of spiritual merit,
wealth and pleasure. The wife should be pure in mind, speech and action;
she should abide by the instructions of her husband, and follow him like
his shadow, and be a friend in all his activities and servant in all his
commands.’
