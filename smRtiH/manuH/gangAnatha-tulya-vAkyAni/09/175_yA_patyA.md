*Baudhāyana* (2.3.27).—‘He is called the *Paunarbhava* son who is born
of a remarried woman;—*i.e*., of one who having left an impotent man,
has taken a second husband.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.18-20).—‘The fourth is the *Paunarbhava*, one born of a
*Punarbhū* woman; that woman is called *Punarbhū* who, leaving the
husband of her youth, and having lived with others, re-enters his
family; and she is called *remarried* who, leaving an impotent, outcast
or mad husband,—after his death,—takes another lord.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.7-9).—‘The *son of the re-married woman* is the fourth;—she
who, being still a virgin, is married a second time is called the
*re-married* woman.—She also is called *remarried* who, though not
legally married more than once, has lived with another man before her
lawful marriage.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.130).—‘That son is called *Paunarbhava* who is born of
a woman married again, either after losing her virginity or before it.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 564).—‘If a woman, after forsaking her
impotent or outcast husband, takes another lord,—the son born from her
is called *Paunarbhava*; and he belongs clearly to his begetter.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 41).—‘The son of the woman married again, is called
*Paunarbhava*.’
