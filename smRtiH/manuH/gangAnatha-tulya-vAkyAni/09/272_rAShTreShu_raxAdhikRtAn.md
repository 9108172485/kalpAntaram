*Nārada* (Theft: 15-18).—‘Those who are the governors in the
principality, and the neighbours called in to save life and property are
reckoned as equal to thieves when they stand neutral during the attack
(by robbers). He on whose ground a robbery has been committed must trace
the thieves to the best of his power, or else he must make good what has
been stolen, unless the foot-prints can be traced from that ground to
another man’s ground; when the foot-prints cannot be traced any further,
the neighbours, road-inspectors and governors of that region shall be
made responsible for the loss. When a bouse has been plundered, the King
shall cause the detectives, the guards and the inhabitants of that
region to make good the loss, if the thief is not caught.’
