*Mahābhārata* (13.45-11).—(Same as Manu.)

*Baudhāyana* (2.3-14).—‘One must know a son begotten by the husband
himself on a wedded wife of equal caste to be a legitimate son of the
body. They quote the following: “From the several limbs of my body art
thou produced, from my heart art thou born; thou art my very *self*
called a son; mayst thou live a hundred years.’
