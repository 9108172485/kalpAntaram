*Yājñavalkya* (2.120).—‘When a property has been acquired by several
brothers in common, it shall be shared equally by all. Among sons of the
several brothers, the shares shall be apportioned in accordance with
what would have been the share of their respective fathers.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.14, Aparārka, p. 727).—‘What has been acquired by
several brothers living together,—in that property all are equal
sharers; if each of them has an equal and unequal number of sons, these
latter shall take the shares of their respective fathers.’
