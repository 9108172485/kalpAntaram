*Baudhāyana* (2.3.34-35).—‘The son belongs to the begetter............
After one’s death, the son belongs to the begetter.’

*Āpastamba* (2-13.6-10).—‘A Brāhmaṇa text says—“The son belongs to the
begetter.”—They quote also the following—“Having considered myself
formerly a father, I shall not now allow my wives to be approached by
other men; since they have declared that a son belongs to the
begetter...... In the next world, the son belongs to the begetter.”’
