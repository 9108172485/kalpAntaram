**(verses 9.298-300)**

*Kāmandaka* (12.26 etc.).—‘Sly spies, disguised as ascetics, traders or
artisans, should go out in all directions, apprising themselves of the
opinion of the world. Spies well-informed in everything should every day
come to and go away from the King; as they are the eyes of the King and
enable him to see distant things.’
