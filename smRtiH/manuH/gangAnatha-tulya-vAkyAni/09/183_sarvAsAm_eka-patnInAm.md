*Vaśiṣṭha* (17, 11).—‘If among many wives of one husband, one have a
son, they all become *with son*, through that son;—thus says the Veda.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.41).—‘Amongst wives of one husband also, the son of one is
the son of all.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.100).—‘The same rule applies to a plurality of wives; if
one of them has male issue, that son shall offer the Ball of meal to
them all.’
