*Gautama* (28.11-13).—‘Or, let them each take one kind of property,
selecting, according to seniority, what they desire, ten head of cattle.
But no one brother shall take ten one-hoofed animals or ten slaves.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17. 42-45).—‘Let the eldest take a double share;—and a tithe
of kine and horses:—the goats, the sheep, the house belong to the
youngest;—black iron, the utensils and the furniture to the middlemost.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2-114).—(See above under 312-313.)
