*Viṣṇu* (26.1-4).—‘If a man has several wives of his own caste, he shall
perform his religious duties with the eldest wife. If he has several
wives of diverse castes, he shall perform them, even with the youngest
wife, if she is of the same caste as himself. On failure of a wife of
his own caste, be shall perform them with one belonging to the caste
next below his own; so also in cases of distress;—but no twice-born man
shall ever do it with a Śūdra wife.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.88).—‘So long as a wife of the same caste as himself is
alive, he shall not have his religious acts done by another; and among
several wives of the same caste, the younger one shall not be employed
in religious acts, except along with the eldest.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 420).—‘If a man has several wives, he
should have his religious acts, such as the tending of the Sacrificial
Fire, done by one who belongs to the same caste as himself; if there are
several of the same caste as himself, then by the eldest among them, if
she is not defective; or by one who has given birth to a heroic son and
is most obedient to him, skilful, sweet-speaking and pure.’
