*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.36).—‘The buying of a wife is mentioned in the following
passage of the Veda:—“Therefore one hundred cows besides a chariot
should be given to the bride’s father.”’

*Āpastamba* (2.13.12)—‘It is declared in the Veda that at the time of
marriage, a gift, with a view to meet the father’s wishes, should be
made by the bridegroom to the father—“Therefore he should give a hundred
cows besides a chariot; this gift he should make bootless by returning
it to the giver.” In reference to these marriage-rites, the word “Sale”
can apply only in a metaphorical sense; as such union is effected under
the law.’
