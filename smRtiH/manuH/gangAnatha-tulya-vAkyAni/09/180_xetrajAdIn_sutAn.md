*Bṛhaspati* (25.33-34).—‘Of the thirteen sons mentioned by Manu, the
Body-born and the Appointed Daughter continue the family.—As in default
of clarified butter, oil is admitted by the righteous as a substitute,
so are the eleven sons admitted as substitutes, in default of the
Body-born son and of the Appointed Daughter.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 576).—‘While the Body-born son or
the Appointed Daughter is there, the *Kṣetraja* and other sons,
belonging as they do to different *gotras*, are only continuers of the
family; and they perform the *śrāddha* as slaves.’
