*Bṛhaspati* (25.33, 35).—‘Of the thirteen sons mentioned by Manu, the
Body-horn son and the Appointed Daughter continue the family. No one hut
a Body-born son is declared to be the father’s heir; an Appointed
Daughter is equal to him; all the others are entitled to maintenance
only.’

*Kātyāyana* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 347).—‘On the birth of a
Body-born son, the other sons are entitled to only a fourth part of the
share, if they belong to the same caste as the father; if they belong to
lower castes, they are entitled to food and clothing only.’
