*Gautama* (18-21).—‘A girl should be given in marriage before puberty.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.70).—‘Out of fear of the appearance of the menses, let
the father marry his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if
she stays in the home after the age of puberty, sin falls on the
father.’

*Baudhāyana* (4. 1.11).—‘Let him give his daughter, while she still goes
about naked, to a man who has not broken the vow of chastity and who
possesses good qualities, or even to one destitute of good qualities;
let him not keep the maiden in his house after she has reached the age
of puberty.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 754).—‘Family, character, beautiful
body, age, learning, wealth, presence of guardians,—these seven
qualifications should he sought for before a girl is given away; nothing
else need he considered.’

*Lalla* (Do.).—‘Caste, learning, age, character, health, large family,
wealth, Brahmanic character,—these eight should he the qualities of the
Bridegroom.’

*Gautama* (Do.).—‘One should give away his daughter to a man who is
endowed with learning, character, relations and good conduct.’

*Śātātapa* (Do., p. 755).—‘That bridegroom should he selected who is
seeking for a wife and is endowed with good family and character,
handsome, learned, intelligent and young, and free from defects.’
