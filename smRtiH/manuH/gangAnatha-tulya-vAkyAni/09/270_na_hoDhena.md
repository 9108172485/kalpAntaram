*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 849).—‘Whether the man has, or has not, been
found in possession of the stolen goods, if his crime has been
established by evidence, he shall have his limbs cut off and then
banished.’

*Nārada* (Theft: 8-11).—‘Those on whom the stolen goods have been
seized, the King should examine, when they have been arrested on
suspicion; their fear having been excited, they shall depose truthfully
regarding the facts of the case. When questions are put to them their
face changes colour, or the voice falters,...... when they are found to
have been previously convicted of larceny, or when there is documentary
evidence against them; it is by all these means that they should be
convicted as thieves, and not merely by being in possession of the
stolen goods.’
