**(verses 9.211-212)

*Viṣṇu* (17.17).—‘A re-united co-parcener shall take the share of his
re-united co-parcener who has died without issue; and a uterine brother
that of his uterine brother; and they shall give the shares of their
deceased co-parceners and uterine brothers to the sons of the latter.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.138).—‘Between two re-united co-parceners, if one
should die, the other shall take his share; hut in the event of a
posthumous son being born to the former, the living co-parcener shall
make over the dead father’s share to that son. Similarly in the case of
two re-united uterine brothers.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.74-76).—‘When anyone brother should die, or anyhow
renounce worldly interests, his share is not lost; it is allotted to his
uterine brother. If there be a sister, she is entitled to a share of his
property. This is the law regarding the property of one destitute of
issue, and who has left no wife or father. When two co-parceners have
again become united, they shall mutually inherit their property.’

*Śaṅkha* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 603).—‘Among brothers, if anyone, without
issue, should renounce the world, or die,—the remaining brothers shall
divide among themselves all his property, except the *strīdhana*.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do., p. 605).—‘The shares of re-united co-parceners shall
be taken by re-united co-parceners; those of brothers living separately
by those living separately;—in both cases, if there is no wife or other
heir.’
