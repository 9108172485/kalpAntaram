*Mahābhārata* (3.12.68).—

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 410).—‘One must guard one’s wife against
sensual contact, as the ruin of the wife involves the ruin of the
family; the ruin of the family involves the ruin of the line; the ruin
of the line involves the ruin of all offerings to gods and Pitṛs; the
ruin of offerings involves the ruin of Dharma; the ruin of Dharma leads
to the ruin of the soul; and the ruin of the soul means the loss of all
things.’

*Paiṭhīnaśi* (Do., p. 411).—‘For these reasons, one must guard one’s
wife: lest there he a confusion of castes.’

*Bṛhaspati* (24-2).—(See under 2.)
