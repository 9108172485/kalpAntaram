gives her in marriage to another, shall he punished as a thief;—unless
the first suitor have a blemish.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.65).—‘A maiden is given away hut once; having given her
away, if one takes her hack, he becomes liable to punishment; hut even
after giving her away, one may take her hack, if a better suitor should

to a suitor, one may not give her to him if he happen to he beset with
vice.’

Do. (12.32).—‘When a man, after having made a solemn promise of marrying
his daughter to a certain suitor, does not deliver her afterwards, he
shall be punished by the King like a thief, in case the suitor be free
from defects.’

Do. (Aparārka, p. 94).—‘If even after betrothal, some defect is found in
either the bride or the bridegroom, the betrothal may be cancelled;
there is no finality in mere betrothal.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.)—‘If, after betrothal, the bridegroom becomes lost, the
girl shall wait for three months and then select another man. If a girl
has been betrothed to one and married to another, she shall be given
away, even after the performance of the ceremonies, to the person to
whom she had been previously promised.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘If the bridegroom happen to die after the girl has
been given away with water and verbally,—hut has not gone through the
ceremonies with mantras,—she remains an unmarried maiden with her
father.’
