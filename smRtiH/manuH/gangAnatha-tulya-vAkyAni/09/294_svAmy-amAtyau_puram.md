*Yājñavalkya* (1.352).—‘The Master, the Minister, the People, the Fort,
the Treasury, Forces, and Allies,—these are the constituent factors of
the kingdom, which is, on that account, called *seven-limbed*.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.16).—‘King, Minister, Kingdom, Fort, Treasury, Army and
Allies are known to form the seven constituents of the state; good sense
and unebbing energy are its primary stay.’

Do. (4.1-2).—‘King, Minister, Kingdom, Fort, Treasury, Army and Allies
are the seven constituents of the State. They contribute to one
another’s weal, etc.’

Do. (8.4-5),—‘Minister, Fort, Kingdom, Treasury and Army these five have
been said, by persons well-versed in Polity, to be the principal
constituents of a Central Sovereign. These five and the allied
sovereigns, and in the seventh place, the central monarch himself;—these
together have been said by Bṛhaspati to compose what is known as
*government with seven constituents*.’

Do. (14.1).—‘The constituents, beginning with the Minister and ending
with the Ally are said to be the constituents of government. Of all the
weaknesses, the gravest is the weakness of the Ruler himself.’
