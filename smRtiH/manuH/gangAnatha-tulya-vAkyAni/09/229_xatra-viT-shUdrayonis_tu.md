*Yājñavalkya* (2.43).—‘If a man of the lower castes is very much reduced
in circumstances, he should be made to do work, towards repayment of the
debt; but the Brāhmaṇa should never be made to work; he should be made
to pay up gradually, as he goes on getting money.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Aparārka, p. 616).—‘If the debtor has absolutely no wealth,
he should be brought home and made to work; but the Brāhmaṇa should be
made to repay the debt gradually.’
