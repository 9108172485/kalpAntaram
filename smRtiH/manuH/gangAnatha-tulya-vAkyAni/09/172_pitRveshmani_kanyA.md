*Baudhāyana* (2.3-24).—‘If anyone approaches an unmarried girl without
authorisation, the son born of such union is called the *Kānīna*, born
of the unmarried damsel.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.22-23).—‘They declare that the son whom an unmarried girl
bears, through lust, in her father’s house is the son of his maternal
grandfather. They quote the following—“If an unmarried daughter bear a
son begotten by a man of equal caste, the maternal grandfather has a son
through him; he shall offer the Ball to and take the wealth of that
grandfather.”’

*Viṣṇu* (15.10.11-12).—‘The *Kānīna* is the fifth kind of son; that son
is called so who is born of an unmarried daughter in the house of her
father;—and he belongs to the man who afterwards marries his mother.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.129).—‘The *Kānīna*, horn of an unmarried damsel, is
the son to his maternal grandfather.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 41).—‘The *Kānīna* is born of the womb of an unmarried
girl.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 565).—‘If a son is born to a girl
who has not yet been given in marriage, in her father’s house, from a
man of the same caste as herself, that son is called *Kānīna*; and he is
a son to that man to whom the girl is subsequently given in marriage.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—‘The *Kānīna*, the *Sahoḍha* and the *Gūḍhaja* sons
belong to him who marries the mother.’
