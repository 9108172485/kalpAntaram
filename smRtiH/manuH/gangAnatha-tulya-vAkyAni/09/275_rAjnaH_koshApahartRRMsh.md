*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 368).—‘Those who are addicted to
amusements reserved for the King, those who take upon themselves the
functions of the King, and those who talk ill of the King, all these
shall suffer corporal punishment.—Those who assume the appearance of the
King, those who amuse themselves during the hours of work, those who
extort exorbitant taxes, and those who steal the King’s wealth,—should
suffer diverse forms of corporal punishment.’

*Viṣṇu* (Do., p. 369).—‘Those who, not belonging to the royal family,
seek to obtain the kingdom should be put to death.’

*Vyāsa* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 395).—‘Those Judges who, on
receiving bribes, decide a case unjustly, those who injure the King’s
property, those who live on bribes,—these the King shall banish, after
having confiscated all their property.’
