**(verses 9.196-197)**

*Viṣṇu* (17, 19.20).—‘If a woman, married according to one of the first
four forms of marriage beginning with *Brāhma*, dies without issue, her
*strīdhana* goes to her husband;—if she has been married by one of the
four reprehensible forms of marriage, her father shall take her
property.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.141-145).—‘If a woman dies without issue, her kinsmen
shall obtain what she had got from her kinsmen, or as her nuptial fee or
as the *Anvādheyaka* present; if a woman married according to the four
forms of marriage beginning with the Brāhma, dies without issue, her
property goes to her husband; if she had issue, it goes to her
daughters;—if she had been married by the other forms of marriage, her
property goes to her father.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 518).—‘In the absence of the daughter, the
*Strīdhana* of the mother should go to the sons; what was given to her
by her kinsmen should go to her husband, in the absence of kinsmen. The
sisters along with their husbands shall divide with the kinsmen, the
*strīdhana*. Such is the lawful law of partition.’
