wife of a deceased man, or of a eunuch, or of a man incurably deceased,
after she has been authorised,—is called the *Kṣetraja*, son begotten on
one’s wife by another man;—such a son has two fathers and belongs to two
families; he has the right to offer the funeral oblations and to inherit
the property of his two fathers.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.14).—‘The second is the *Kṣetraja* son, who is begotten
by an authorised kinsman on the wife of a person who has failed (by
death or disease),’

*sapiṇḍa* kinsman, or by a member of the highest caste, on an authorised
wife or widow.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.12).—‘Th *e Kṣetraja* son is that begotten on one’s
wife by a *Sagotra* or other kinsman.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 40).—‘The *Kṣetraja* son is that begotten on one’s
wife by a *Sagotra* kinsman, or a kinsman not belonging to the same
*gotra*—who is authorised to do so.’

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 557).—‘The son begotten by another while
the woman’s husband is alive is called *Kṣetraja*; and when begotten
after his death is called *Dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa*.’
