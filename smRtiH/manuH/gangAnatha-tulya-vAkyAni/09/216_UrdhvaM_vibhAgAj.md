*Gautama* (28.29).—‘A son horn after partition takes exclusively the
property of his father.’

*Viṣṇu* (17.3).—‘Sons who have separated from their father should give a
share to the brother who is born after the partition.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.122).—‘If a son is born of a wife of equal caste, after
the property has been partitioned (among the sons), ho is entitled to
the share of his father; or he may obtain his share from any such
property as may he discovered after the said partition, after it has
been cleared of all accounts of income and expenditure.’

*Bṛhsapati* (25.17, 20).—‘When step-brothers horn of different mothers,
or uterine brothers, have come to a division with their father, brothers
born after that shall take their father’s share. In such cases the son
horn before partition has no right to the father’s share; nor can a
brother’s property be claimed by one born after partition; whatever
shall have been acquired by the father, after he has come to a partition
with his sons, all that belongs to the son born after partition; those
born before it have no right to it. In regard to the property, as also
debts, gifts, pledges and purchases, the father and the divided sons
have no concern with one another; except in regard to impurity (due to
births and deaths) and the funeral oblations.’
