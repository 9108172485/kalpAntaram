*Viṣṇu* (5.9, 11).—‘The King shall put to death those who forge royal
edicts;—and those who forge private documents;—and also poisoners,
incendiaries, robbers, killers of women, children or men;—those stealing
more than ten

*Kumbhas* of grain,—or more than a hundred *māṣas* of things sold by
weight;—also those who aspire to sovereignty, though being of low birth;
breakers of dikes, and such as give shelter to robbers; and a woman who
is unfaithful to her lord.’

*Viṣṇu* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 370).—‘One who tries to contaminate the
limbs of the kingdom—Minister, etc., and the people—should be put to
death.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.240).—‘One who forges weighing scales, royal edicts,
weights and measures, or coins,—and one who deals with these,—should be
fined the highest amercement.’

Do. (2.294).—‘One who subtracts from or adds to a royal edict, and one
who lets go an adulterer or a thief,—should be fined the highest
amercement.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 862).—‘One who makes use of a forged
document, or disobeys a royal edict, and deals with short weights and
measures should suffer corporal punishment or cutting off of a limb.’

*Katyāyana* (Do.).—‘One who tries to establish his case either by forged
evidence or by means of a forged seal, should he fined with the highest
amercement.’
