*Yājñavalkya* (2.276).—‘If a man is found to have knowingly supplied to
the thief or the robber with food or lodging, or fire, or water, or
advice, or implements, or expenses, he shall be punished with the
highest amercement.’

*Gautama* (Aparārka, p. 850).—‘The man who advises the thief, or
knowingly receives the stolen goods, is equal to the thief.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 340),—‘Those who buy the vessels or
receive the stolen goods, or those who hide the thieves, are declared to
be subject to the same punishments as the thieves themselves.’

*Viṣṇu* (Do.).—‘The King shall put to death those who supply thieves
with food and lodging.’

*Nārada* (14.19).—‘Those who give food or shelter to thieves seeking
refuge with them, or who suffer them to escape, though able to arrest
them, partake of the crime themselves.’

Do. (Theft: 13-14).—‘Those who give food to thieves, as well as those
who supply them with fire or water, or who give shelter, or show the way
to them, or make their defence, or who buy their goods, or receive their
goods, or those who hide them are held to be as punishable as the
thieves themselves.’
