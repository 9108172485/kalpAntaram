*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.39, 81).—‘They quote the rule that the last mentioned six
sons shall inherit the property of him who has no son mentioned among
the first-mentioned six classes. Let the *Sapiṇḍas* or the subsidiary
sons divide the heritage of him who has no son of the first-mentioned
six kinds.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.28-29).—‘Among these sons, each preceding one is preferable
to the one next in order;—and he takes the inheritance before the next
in order.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.132).—‘Among the sons, the succeeding one is entitled
to offer the Ball and inherit the property only in the absence of the
preceding one.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 552).—(Same as Manu.)

*Bṛhaspati* (25.39-41).—‘The other sons, beginning with the *Kṣetraja*,
shall respectively take a fifth, a sixth and a seventh part. The
adopted, the cast off, the bought, the appointed and the son by a Śūdra
wife;—these, when pure by caste, and irreproachable in their conduct,
are considered as sons of middle rank. The *Kṣetraja* is despised by the
virtuous; and so are the son born of the re-married woman, the son of an
unmarried damsel, the son received with the pregnant bride and the son
secretly born.’

*Hārīta* (25.39-41).—‘Sons of the Śūdra wife, sons self-given and sons
bought are all as had as the Śūdra-born.’
