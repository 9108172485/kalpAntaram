*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, pp. 335 and 337).—‘The King shall search for
thieves on roads passing on boundaries, and in places inhabited by
dishonest men as bad as thieves; he shall make a search in villages
through Caṇḍālas and executioners and other persons who may he in the
habit of moving about at night...... He shall have the thieves shadowed
by variously disguised spies clover in the art of catching thieves, and
other trustworthy persons. These spies shall employ by gifts those who
have been thieves in the past, and with the advice of these men, they
shall arrange to meet the thieves. If some of these do not come to meet
them, they shall be at once arrested along with their sons and
relations.’
