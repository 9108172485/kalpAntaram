*Baudhāyana* (4.1.15-16).—‘If a damsel has been abducted by force, and
has not been wedded with the sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to
another man; she is even like a maiden.—If, after a damsel has been
given away,—or even after the nuptial rites have been performed,—the
bridegroom dies,—she who has thus left the father’s house and has come
hack to it, may ho again wedded, according to the rule applicable to
second weddings; provided the marriage had not been consummated.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.74).—‘If a damsel, before the death of her husband, had
been merely wedded by the sacred texts, and the marriage had not been
consummated, she may be married again.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.8).—‘She who being still a virgin, is married a second time
is called *Punarbhū*, *re-married*.’
