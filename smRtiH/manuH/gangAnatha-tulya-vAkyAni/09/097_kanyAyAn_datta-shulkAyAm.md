*Vaśiṣṭha* (17-72).—‘If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been
promised to him verbally and by a libation of water,—but before she was
married to him with the sacred texts,—she belongs to her father.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, 739).—‘If a man should die or
become lost, after betrothal, the girl shall wait for three menstrual
periods and then marry another person. If the betrothed should go away
after having paid the nuptial fee and the girl’s dowry, the girl shall
be kept unmarried for one year, after which she should be given away in
the proper form to another man.’
