*Viṣṇu* (5.160-161).—‘He who, having promised his daughter to one
suitor, marries her to another, shall be punished as a thief, unless the
first suitor have a blemish.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.65).—‘A girl is betrothed but once; if the father takes
her away after that, he should suffer the punishment of a thief; but he
may take her away from the man to whom she has been betrothed, if a
superior suitor happens to turn up.’

*Nārada* (12-30).—‘Should a more respectable suitor, who appears
eligible in point of religious merit, fortune and amiability, present
himself,—after the nuptial fee has already been presented by a former
suitor,—the verbal engagement previously made shall he annulled.’
