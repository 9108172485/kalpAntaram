*Viṣṇu* (18.43).—‘If a man recovers a property which could not before be
recovered by his father, he shall not, unless by his own free will,
divide it with his sons; as it is an acquisition made by himself.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.119).—‘If one recovers an ancestral property that had
been taken away by others, he shall not give it to his co-parceners; nor
what he has acquired by his learning.’

*Ṛṣyaśṛṅga* (Aparārka, p. 724).—‘If one of the co-parceners recovers
landed property that had been lost, the other co-parceners also shall
have shares in it, alter making over to him a fourth part as his special
share.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyavahāra, p. 339).—‘If a property that
belonged to the grandfather but became lost, is recovered by the father
by his own effort, or what is acquired by him by his valour or
learning,—over that property the father’s right is absolute.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘What had become lost,—if that is recovered by the
father through his own effort,—all that the father cannot he forced to
share with his sons.’
