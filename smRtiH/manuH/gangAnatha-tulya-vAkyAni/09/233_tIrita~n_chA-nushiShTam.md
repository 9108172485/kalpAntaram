*Yājñavalkya* (2.305).—‘The man who, though defeated in the suit, does
not accept defeat, and comes forward again to contest the suit, should
be again non-suited and fined double the amount of the suit.’

Do. (2.304).—‘Those cases that have been wrongly decided, the King shall
try again and punish each of the judges and the party in whose favour
the case had been decided by them, with a fine double the amount of the
suit.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 866).—‘When a legal transaction has been
completed and a punishment has been inflicted,—if a party feels that it
has been illegally done, he should have the case re-tried, undertaking
to pay double the fine previously inflicted upon him.’

*Bṛhaspati* (6.5).—‘When a party does not feel satisfied with the
decision arrived at by assemblies of kindreds or other agencies, the
King should revise that decision and institute a fresh trial, if it
should prove to have been unjust.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.553).—‘When a Minister or the judge decides a case
contrary to the law, the King shall revise it and fine the judge one
thousand.’
