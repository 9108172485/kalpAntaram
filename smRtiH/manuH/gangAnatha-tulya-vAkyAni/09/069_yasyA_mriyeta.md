*Vaśiṣṭha* (17.72-74).—‘If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has
been promised to him verbally and by a libation of water,—but before she
was married to him with the sacred texts,—she belongs to her father
alone. If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not wedded with the
sacred texts, she may lawfully he given to another man; she is even like
a maiden. If before the death of her husband, the damsel had merely been
wedded with the sacred texts, and the marriage had not been consummated,
she may be married again.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 739).—‘If a man should die or
become lost after betrothal, the girl shall wait for three menstrual
periods and then marry another person.’
