**(verses 9.14-16)

*Dakṣa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 413).—‘Women are like the leech; but while
the poor leech draws blood only, the woman draws your riches, your
property, your flesh, your virility and your strength. During
adolescence, she is in fear of the man, during youth, she demands
excessive pleasure, and when her husband becomes old, she does not care
a straw for him.’

*Rāmāyaṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 414).—‘For women there is no one loved
or hated; they betake themselves to all men; just as creepers growing in
a thick forest hang themselves on all trees.’
