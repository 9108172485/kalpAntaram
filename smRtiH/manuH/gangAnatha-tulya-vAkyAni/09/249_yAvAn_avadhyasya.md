*Yājñavalkya* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 649).—‘The King who punishes those
who deserve to he punished and protects those who are well-behaved,
performs sacrifices where hundreds of thousands are given as the
sacrificial fee. Punishment unjustly inflicted destroys both spiritual
merit and fame; and when justly inflicted, it brings to the King heaven,
fame and victory.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do., p. 650).—‘King’s ministers incur terrible sin if they
omit to chastise the sinners and punish those who are well-behaved.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘If punishment is wrongly inflicted, the King should
fast for one day, the priest for three days; or, if punishment is not
inflicted on those who deserve it, the King shall fast for three days
and the priest should perform the *Kṛcchra* penance.’
