*Viṣṇu* (5.74)—‘The double punishment is likewise ordained for those who
do not give assistance to one calling for help, though they happen to he
on the spot, or who run away after having approached it.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 850).—‘When people are crying for help when some
one is being forcibly carried away,—if one, on hearing the cry, does not
go forward to help, he shall partake of the crime.’
