*Gautama* (28.44).—‘The male offspring of the idiot receives his
father’s share.’

*Viṣṇu* (15.34-38).—‘Of the idiot and the rest the legitimate sons
receive a share;—but not the children of an outcast,—provided they are
born after the commission of the act that rendered the parents
outcasts.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.141).—‘Of the eunuch and the rest, the *Body-born* and
the *Kṣetraja* sons, if they are free from defects, are entitled to
shares; and their daughters should be maintained till they are made over
to their husbands.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparāka, p. 751).—‘One born of the outcast is an outcast,
except the female child.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 419).—‘The sons of these are entitled to
shares.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do., p, 491).—‘The son of a wife married irregularly is
entitled to inheritance when he belongs to the same caste as his father;
so also is the son born of a regularly married wife, even though she may
have been of a different caste; but the son of a woman married in the
reverse order is not entitled to a share; to him his kinsmen should give
food and clothing.’
