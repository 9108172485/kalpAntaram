*Gautama* (28.34)—‘The son of an unmarried damsel, the son of the
pregnant bride, the son of the remarried woman, the son of the appointed
daughter, the self-given son, and the bought son receive a fourth of the
estate, if there is no body-born son, or no one of the first six kinds
of son.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.132).—‘Among the twelve kinds of sons, the succeeding
one is entitled to offer the Ball and to inherit property only in the
absence of the preceding one.’

*Baudhāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 550).—‘The following sons are said to
he partakers of inheritance; the body-born son, the son of the appointed
daughter, the son begotten on one’s wife by another man, the adopted
son, the appointed son, the secretly-born son, and the cast-off son. The
following are partakers of the *gotra* only—the son born of the unborn
damsel, the son born of the pregnant bride, the son bought, the son of
the remarried woman, the self-given son and the son of the Śūdra
mother.’
