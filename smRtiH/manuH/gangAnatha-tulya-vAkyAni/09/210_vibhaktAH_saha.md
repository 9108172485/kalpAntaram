*Viṣṇu* (18.41).—‘If brothers, who after a previous division of the
estate, live again together as parceners, should make a second
partition, the shares must be equal in that case; and the eldest has no
right to an additional share.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.120).—‘When a property has been acquired by several
brothers in common, it shall be shared equally by all.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.73).—‘When brothers formerly divided are again living
together through affection, and arrange a second partition, the right of
primogeniture does not accrue in that case.’
