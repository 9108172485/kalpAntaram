*Yājñavalkya* (2.133).—‘A son born to a Śūdra father from a slave-girl
may inherit his property, by the desire of his father; on the death of
the father, his brothers may allot to him one-half share;—if there are
no brothers, nor sons of the father’s daughter born of his married wife,
then he shall take the whole property.’
