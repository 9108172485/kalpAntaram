*Gautama* (28.14-17).—‘If a man has several wives, the additional share
of the eldest son is one bull;—but if the eldest son also happen to be
born of the first-married wife, his additional share shall consist of
fifteen cows and one hull. The oldest son born of a later-married wife
shall share the estate equally with his younger brothers born of the
senior wife. Or the special shares shall be adjusted in each class of
sons, according to their mothers.’

*Bṛhaspati* (25.15).—‘When there are many sons sprung from one father,
equal in caste and number, but born of different mothers, a legal
division may be effected by adjusting the shares according to the
mothers.’

*Devala* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 477).—‘Among sons belonging to castes
other than that of the father, seniority is determined by their moral
character; between twins, by actual birth, *i.e*., that one is senior
whose face the father sees first.’
