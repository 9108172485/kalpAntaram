**(verses 9.72-73)

*Viṣṇu* (5.162).—‘The punishment of a thief is ordained for a suitor
abandoning a girl after betrothal, if she is free from blemish.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.66).—‘If a man gives away a girl without mentioning her
defects, he should be fined with the highest amercement; but the man
that abandons a faultless girl betrothed to him should be punished; and
if he falsely attributes defects to her, he should be fined one
hundred.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 96).—‘After having accepted a maiden free from
defects, if the man abandons her, he should he punished; and even though
he may desire another maiden he should marry the same former maiden.’

Do. (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 745).—‘One shall not find fault with a
faultless bride, or with a faultless bridegroom; but if the fault is
there, there is nothing wrong in mentioning it and abandoning one
another.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘If a man marries a girl without proclaiming his own
defects, or asks for her hand, he shall not obtain her, even though she
may have been betrothed to him. In the same manner if the girl is
subsequently found to have defects, the giver of her shall be punished.’
