unfit to receive alms enter the bodies of cattle; those who have
committed a crime causing defilement enter the bodies of low-caste men
who may not be touched; those who have committed one of the
miscellaneous crimes enter the bodies of miscellaneous wild carnivorous
animals. One who has eaten the food of one whose food should not be
eaten, or forbidden food, becomes a worm or insect. thief becomes a
