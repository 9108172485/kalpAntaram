**(verses 12.53-59)**

*Yājñavalkya* (3.207-208).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa is born among deer,
horses, pigs and camels; and the wine-drinker, among asses, *Pukkasas*
and *Venas*, the stealer of gold being a worm, an insect or flies; and
the violator of the *Guru’s* bed becomes grass or bushes or creepers.’

(See texts under 11.49 *et seq*.)
