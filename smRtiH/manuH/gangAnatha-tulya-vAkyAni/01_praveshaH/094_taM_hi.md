*Yājñavalkya*, 1.198-109.—‘Having performed austerities, Brahmā created
the Brāhmaṇas, for the guarding of the Vedas, for the satisfaction of
Pitṛs and Gods and for the protection of Dharma. Those Brāhmaṇas who are
devoted to learning and study, are the source of everything, superior to
these are those who are devoted to religious acts; and superior even to
these are those who are the best knowers of the science of the self.’
