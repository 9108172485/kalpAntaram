*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.6-7).—‘He whose heart is free from desire is called
*śiṣṭa*. Acts sanctioned by the sacred law are those for which no
worldly cause is perceptible.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.43).—‘Those Brāhmaṇas in whose families the study of the
Veda and the subsidiary sciences is hereditary, and who are able to
adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts, must be
known to be *śiṣṭa*, cultured.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.5-6).—‘*Śiṣṭa*, cultured, forsooth, are those who are
free from envy, free from pride, contented with a store of grain
sufficient for ten days, free from covetousness, and free from
hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, perplexity and anger. Those are called
*cultured* who, in accordance with the sacred Law, have studied the Veda
together with its subsidiaries, know how to draw inferences from it, and
are able to adduce proofs perceptible by the senses from the revealed
texts.’

*Āpastamba* (2.29.14-15).—‘The indications for doubtful cases are—“He
shall regulate his course of action according to the conduct which is
unanimously recognised in all countries by men of the three twice-born
castes, who have been properly obedient to their teachers, who are aged,
of subdued senses, free from avarice and hypocrisy.” Acting thus he will
gain both worlds. Some people say that the remaining duties must be
learnt from women and from men of all castes.’
