*Maitryupaniṣad* (3.5).

*Yājñavalkya* (3.137-138).—‘Addicted to bad acts, impatient, active,
attached to objects of sense, a man abounds in the attribute of *Rajas*,
and is re-born among men. Lethargic, cruel in bis acts, covetous,
heretic, addicted to begging, careless, of bad character, a man abounds
in the attribute of *Tamas*, and is born among animals.’
