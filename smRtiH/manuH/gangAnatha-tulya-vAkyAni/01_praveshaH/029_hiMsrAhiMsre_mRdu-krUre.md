**(verse xviii-xix)**

*Mahābhārata*, 12.232.16.—‘Of the created things, whatever functions
became assigned to whichever thing at the beginning of creation, that
thing take to those same functions, whenever they are created again and
again.’ ‘Harmfulness or harmlessness, gentleness or ferociousness,
righteousness or unrighteousness, truthfulness or untruthfulness, with
one or the other of these they are obsessed, and hence are they fond of
just those.’
