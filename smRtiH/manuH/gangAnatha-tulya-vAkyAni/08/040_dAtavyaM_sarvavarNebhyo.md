*Gautuma* (10.46-47).—‘Having recovered property stolen by thieves, he
shall return it to the owner;—or he shall pay its value out of his own
treasury.’

*Āpastamba* (2.26.8) (2.268?).—‘The King’s officers should ho made to
repay what is stolen within the boundaries of their charge.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.66-67).—‘Having recovered the goods stolen by thieves, let
him restore them entire to their owners, to whatever caste they may
belong. If he is unable to recover them, he must pay their value out of
his own treasury.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.36).—‘The King should give to the people, what has been
stolen by thieves; if he does not give it, he incurs the sin of
stealing.’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 641).—‘If the King is unable to recover what has
been stolen by thieves, he shall make it good out of his own treasury.’

*Nārada* (6.16 *et seq*.).—‘He on whose land robbery has been committed
must trace the thieves to the best of his power; or else, he must make
good what has been stolen, unless the footmarks can be traced from that
ground into another man’s ground. When the footmarks, after leaving that
ground, are lost and cannot be traced any further, the neighbours,
inspectors of the road and governors of that region shall be made
responsible for the loss. When a house has been plundered, the King
shall cause the thief-catchers, the guards and the inhabitants of that
region to make good the loss, if the thief is not caught.’
