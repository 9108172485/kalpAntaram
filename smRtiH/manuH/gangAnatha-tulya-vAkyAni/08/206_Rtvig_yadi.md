388.)]

*Yājñavalkya* (2.265).—‘Among a company of joint workers, if one happen
to be dishonest, the others should expel him without payment; if he
happen to omit his share of the work on account of his inability to do
it, then he should have it done by another. This same rule applies to
the case of sacrificial priests, cultivators and artisans.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 836).—‘If the Sacrificial Priest fails to
officiate at a sacrifice, or if a Teacher fails to teach, he should be
abandoned; one becomes degraded if he abandons them in other
circumstances.’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 836).—‘If the Sacrificial Priest happen to be in
trouble, some one else may officiate for him and receive a proportionate
share out of the fee payable to the former.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 117).—‘From among men employed in a
common work, if one happen to die, his share of the work should be done
by a relation of his, or by his colleagues collectively.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do.).—‘If on the approach of the *Savana*, a priest
should happen to die, what should be done is that his work should be
completed by his *Sagotra* or by his pupil; if he has no relations, then
the sacrificer should appoint another Priest.’
