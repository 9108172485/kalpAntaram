*Gautama* (12.51).—‘The award of punishment must be regulated by a
consideration of the status of the criminal, of his bodily strength, of
the nature of the crime, and whether the offence has been repeated.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.367).—‘On those deserving punishment, the King shall
inflict punishment after having considered the nature of the crime, the
time, place and strength of the criminal, as also his age, conduct and
wealth.’

*Nārada* (Punishments, 38).—‘After carefully considering the nature of
the offence, the place and time, and after examining the ability of the
offender, and his motive, he shall inflict the punishments.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.4-7).—‘When he has discovered a man to be an offender,
the King should inflict on him, reprimand, reproach or corporal
chastisement, or one of the four grades of fines. He shall inflict
gentle reprimand when the offence is very light; harsh reproach for a
crime of the first degree; a fine for a crime of the middlemost degree,
and arrest in the case of high treason. Banishment also may be resorted
to by a king desirous of promoting his own welfare;...... and all the
various forms of punishment should be combined in the case of one who
has committed a mortal sin. The King should punish elders, domestic
priests and persons commanding respect, with admonition only; other
litigants he should punish with fine, when they are found guilty; and on
the perpetrators of a heavy crime, he should inflict corporal
punishment.’
