*Nārada* (11.6, 11, 27).—‘When a piece of land has been carried off by a
stream, or abandoned by the owner, or when the boundry-marks have become
obliterated, they shall fix the boundary according to inferences drawn
from an inspection of the spot, and according to the traces of
possession. Should there be no persons conversant with the true state of
tilings, and no boundary-marks, then the King himself shall fix the
boundary between the two estates as he thinks host. A field which has
been held by three generations in succession, and a house which has been
inherited from an ancestor, cannot be estranged from its legitimate
owner by force of possession, except when the King wills it so.’

*Bṛhaspati* (19.14, 23, 24).—‘Those are witnesses in a suit of this kind
who know the title of acquisition, the size, the duration of possession,
the name and the characteristic features of the land in question. When
land is taken from a person enjoying it without legitimate title or
ownership, and given to a worthier person, the latter shall not he
deprived of it. A house, tank, shop or the like having been used by a
man since the time of its foundation, must not he taken away from him,
nor diminished or altered.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 205).—‘Possession is to be taken into
consideration in the matter of deciding boundary-disputes; but only
while there are witnesses deposing to the possession; and witnesses are
of two kinds—those named in documents and those not so named.’
