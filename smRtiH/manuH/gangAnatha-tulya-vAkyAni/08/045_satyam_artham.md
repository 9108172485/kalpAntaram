*Yājñavalkya* (2.19).—‘The King shall investigate suits, by setting
aside mistake or casuistry by facts.’

*Nārada* (1.29-31).—‘Truth rests on true facts; Error is what rests on
mistake of facts. Ordeals even are rendered nugatory by artful men;
therefore let no mistake be committed in regard to place, time, quantity
and so on. A king who acts justly must reject error when it is brought
forward and seek truth alone; because prosperity depends on due
performance of duty.’
