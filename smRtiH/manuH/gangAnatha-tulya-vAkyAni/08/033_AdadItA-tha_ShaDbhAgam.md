of a biped, the owner shall pay five *Paṇas* as the fee; in that of
one-hoofed animals, 4 *Paṇas*; in the case of cows and buffaloes, 2
*Paṇas*; in that of small cattle, one fourth of a *Paṇa*; in the case of
gems and minor metals, five per cent, of the value.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.174).—‘The owner should give to the Under 4 *Paṇas* in
the case of a one-hoofed animal, 5 in the ease of man, two in the ease
of buffaloes, camels and cows, and a fourth *Paṇa* in the case of sheep
or goat.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara).—‘If a man recovers his own property that had
been lost, he shall report it to the King; and he shall take it only
after he has proved his honesty.’
