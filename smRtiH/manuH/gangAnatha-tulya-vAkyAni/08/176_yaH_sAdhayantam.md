*Viṣṇu* (6.18-19).—‘A creditor recovering the sum lent by any lawful
means shall not he reproved by the Xing. If the debtor, so forced to
discharge the debt, complains to the King, he shall be fined in an equal
sum.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.40).—‘If the creditor tries to realise the loan that is
admitted, he shall not he reproved by the King. If, on being thus
pressed to pay, the debtor approaches the King, he should he fined and
made to repay the amount due to the creditor.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 645).—‘If the creditor harasses the debtor who
is acting lawfully, he shall forfeit the debt, and shall also be fined
the same amount.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.54).—‘When a debtor has acknowledged a debt, it may he
recovered from him by the expedients of friendly expostulation and the
rest, by moral suasion, by artful management, by compulsion and by
confinement in the house.’

*Nārada* (1.122, 123).

\[122 is same as [Manu
8.49]\].—

‘A creditor who tides to recover his loan from the debtor must not he
checked by the King, both for secular and religious reasons.’
