*Viṣṇu* (8.20-23).—‘The Brāhmaṇa witness, the Judge shall exhort to
*declare*,—the Kṣatriya, to *declare the truth*:—the Vaiśya he shall
address thus:—‘*Thy kine and gold shall yield thee no fruit*”;—the Śūdra
he should address thus:—“*Thou shalt have to atone for all heavy
crimes*.”’

*Nārada* (1.198).—‘He shall cause the Brāhmaṇa to swear by truth, the
Kṣatriya by his conveyances and weapons, the Vaiśya by his cows, grain
or gold; and the Śūdra by all sorts of crimes.’
