**(verses 8.290-294)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (297-299).—‘In the cases of injury caused through
quadrupeds, or through wood and bricks, or through stones, beasts of
burden or conveyances, there is no offence, if the man operating calls
out—*Move* *out* *of the* *way*;—nor does any offence attach to the
owner of the conveyance, if the injury caused by it has been due, either
to the snapping of the nose-string, or to the breaking of the yoke, or
to the cart moving backwards. In the case of tusked and horned animals
committing havoc, if the owner, though able to do so, does not check
them, he should be made to pay the first amercement; and double of this
when the man about to be injured has cried for help.’
