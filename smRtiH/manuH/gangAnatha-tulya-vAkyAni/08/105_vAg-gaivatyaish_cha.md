**(verses 8.105-106)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (2.83).—‘For expiating the sin involved in deposing
falsely for saving the life of a man, twice-born persons should offer
the cooked rice dedicated to Sarasvatī.’

*Viṣṇu* (8.16-17).—‘In order to expiate the sin committed (by deposing
falsely for saving the life of a man), the witness, if he is a
twice-born person, must pour an oblation into the fire, consecrating it
with the Mantra-texts called *Kūṣmāṇḍī*; if he is a Śūdra, he must feed
ten cows for one day.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.19.16).—‘Let him who has given false evidence (for any
reason) drink hot milk during twelve days and nights, and pour oblations
into the fire with the mantras called *Kūṣmāṇḍī*.’
