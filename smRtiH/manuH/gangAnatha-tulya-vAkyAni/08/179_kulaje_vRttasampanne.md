*Nārada* (2.1, 2)—‘When a man entrusts any property of his own to
another, in confidence and without suspicion, it is called by the
learned a *Deposit*. A sensible man should make a deposit with one who
belongs to a respectable family and who is virtuous, acquainted with his
duties, veracious, influential, wealthy, and honourable.’

*Bṛhaspasti* (12.2, 4).—‘When any chattel is deposited in the house of
another man, through fear of the King, robbers or other dangers, or for
the purpose of deceiving one’s heirs, it is called a *Deposit*. Let a
man make a deposit, after duly considering the place, house, master of
the house, the power, means, quality, veracity and kindred of the
depositary.’
