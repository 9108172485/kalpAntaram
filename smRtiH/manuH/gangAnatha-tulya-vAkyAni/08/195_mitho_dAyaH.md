*Nārada* (2.6).—‘Deposits are of two kinds—attested and unattested. They
must be restored precisely in the same condition in which they were
delivered.’

*Bṛhaspati* (12.5).—‘A deposit is of two kinds—attested and deposited in
private; it must be guarded with the same care as a son.’

Do. (12-14).—‘When a dispute arises with regard to a deposit privately
made, the performance of an ordeal is ordained for both parties, to
establish the facts of the case.’
