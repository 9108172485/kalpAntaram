*Nārada* (1.243, 244).—‘Of gods and sages even, the taking of oaths is
recorded. Vasiṣṭha took an oath when he was accused of having assumed
the shape of an evil spirit. The seven *Ṛṣis* resolutely took an oath
together with Indra, in order to clean themselves mutually of suspicion,
when each was suspected of having stolen lotus-fibres.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.461).—‘Ordeals are known as *divya*, *divine*, because
they were used by the *devas*, gods, in the discrimination of difficult
cases.’
