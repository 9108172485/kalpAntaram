*Yājñavaklya* (1.66).—‘If the bridegroom relinquishes the bride when she
has no defects, he should he punished; and if he falsely accuses her of
defects, he should he lined a hundred.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.47; Aparārka, p. 96).—‘If one speaks of a blemishless girl as
having a blemish, he should be fined the highest amercement..’

*Nārada* (12.3).—‘The selection of the bride loses its binding force
when a blemish is subsequently discovered in her.’

Do. (12.31).—‘Let no man calumniate a faultless maiden; neither must one
calumniate a faultless suitor. When however, there is an actual defect,
it is no offence if they dissolve their mutual agreement.’

Do. (12.34-36).—‘When a man, from hatred, declares a maiden to have lost
her virginity, he shall pay 100 *Paṇas* as tine, unless he is able to
give proofs of her disgrace. When a man, after having plighted his faith
to a maiden, abandons her although she is faultless, he shall be fined
and made to marry the maiden, even against his will. Affliction with a
chronic or hateful disease, deformity, loss of virginity,—these are
declared to be the defects of a maiden.’
