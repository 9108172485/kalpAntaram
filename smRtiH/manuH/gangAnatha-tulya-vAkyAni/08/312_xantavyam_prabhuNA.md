**(verses 8.312-313)  
**

*Nārada* (Theft, 39-40).—‘Neither for the purpose of gaining a friend,
nor for the acquisition of wealth, should a wicked criminal be suffered
by the King to go free. By pardoning an offender, a king commits the
same offence as by punishing an innocent man. Religious merit accrues to
him from punishing the wicked.’

*Bṛhaspati* (22-33).—‘By punishment of the wicked and release of the
virtuous, the renown and religious merit of the King is increased.’

*Gautama* (12-52).—‘Or pardon may be granted in accordance with an
assemblage of persons learned in the Vedas.’
