*Nārada* (18.5-7, 33, 43).—‘The King shall be careful to protect all
orders and the constituent elements of the state... Whenever any caste
should remain behind others, or exceed its limits,—seeing that it has
strayed from its path,—the King shall bring it back to the path of duty.
So also when other wicked acts, opposed to the dictates of the sacred
law, have been committed, the King after having reflected upon the
matter shall inflict punishment on those who deserve it... The King’s
duties are the protecting of his subjects, the honouring of the aged and
the wise, the trying of law-suits and making each caste abide by its
duties...... If a ruler, though severe, is mindful of his duty, correct
in his conduct find quick to punish the wicked and to protect the
virtuous,—his wealth is declared to he pure.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.315).—‘What he has not obtained, he should seek to
obtain lawfully.’
