*Viṣṇu* (5.12).—‘Those who steal more than 10 *kumbhas* of grain, should
be put to death.’

*Nārada* (Theft: 26).—‘Corporal punishment or death shall he inflicted
on him who steals more than 10 *kumbhas* of grain; when the quantity is
less, he shall be made to pay eleven times the value—thus has Manu
ordained.’
