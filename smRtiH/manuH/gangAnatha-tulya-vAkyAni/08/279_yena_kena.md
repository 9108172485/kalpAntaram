**(verses 8.279-280)  
**

*Gautama* (12.1).—‘A Śūdra who criminally assaults twice-born men with
blows shall he deprived of the limb with which he offends.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.19).—‘With whatever limb an inferior insults or hurts his
superior in caste, of that limb the King shall cause him to be
deprived.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.215).—‘That limb of a non-Brāhmaṇa with which he hurts
the Brāhmaṇa should he cut off. If he raises a weapon to strike him, he
shall pay a fine of the first degree; if he only touches the weapon,
then only half of that.’

*Ārthaśāstra* (p. 106).—‘By whatever limb the Śūdra strikes the
Brāhmaṇa, that limb should be cut off; if he only raises a weapon to
strike, some portion of a limb may be cut off; if he only touches the
weapon, the penalty shall be half of that.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 262).—‘For raising the hand to strike a
man of one’s own caste, the fine is 12 *Paṇas*; double of that for
actually striking him.’

*Nārada* (15-16.25).—‘With whatever limb a man of low caste offends a
Brāhmaṇa, that very limb of his shall be cut off; such shall be the
atonement for his crime.’
