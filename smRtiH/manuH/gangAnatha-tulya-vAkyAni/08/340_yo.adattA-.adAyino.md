*Gautama* (12.49-50).—‘A man who knowingly becomes the servant of a
thief shall be treated like a thief;—likewise he who knowingly receives
goods from a thief or an unrighteous man.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 340).—‘Purchasers of stolen property
and accepters of gifts from thieves, as also those who lend them cover,
have been declared to be deserving of the same punishment as the thief.’
