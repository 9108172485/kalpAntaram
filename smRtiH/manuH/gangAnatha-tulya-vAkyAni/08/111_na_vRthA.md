*Nārada* (1.257, 258).—‘Where no one declares himself ready to undergo
punishment, an ordeal cannot take place. An ordeal shall be administered
to litigants when there is reason for it, not otherwise. Therefore an
intelligent, virtuous, righteous and wise king (or judge) should abstain
from administering any one of the five ordeals, unless both parties
consent to it.’
