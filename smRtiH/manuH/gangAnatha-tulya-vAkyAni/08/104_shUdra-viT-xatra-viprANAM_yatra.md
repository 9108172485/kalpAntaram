*Gautama* (13.24-25).—‘No guilt is incurred in giving false evidence in
case the life of a man depends thereon;—but not if the man involved be a
wicked one.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (16.35).—‘Men may speak an untruth in marriage, during
dalliance, when their lives are in danger, or the loss of their entire
property is imminent; and for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa; they declare that
an untruth spoken in these five cases does not make the speaker an
outcast.’

*Viṣṇu* (8.15).—‘Whenever the death of any member of the four castes is
involved, if witnesses give false evidence, they are not to blame.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.83).—‘When the death of a member of any caste is
involved the witness may speak an untruth.’

*Bṛhaspati* (7.34).—‘Let him preserve, even by telling a lie, a Brāhmaṇa
who has sinned once through error, and is in peril of life, and
oppressed by rogues and others.’
