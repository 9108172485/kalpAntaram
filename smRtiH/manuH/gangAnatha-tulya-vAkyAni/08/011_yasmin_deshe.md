*Bṛhaspati* (1.11).—‘That assembly is equal in sanctity to a sacrificial
session in which there sit seven, or five or three Brāhmaṇas, who are
acquainted with the world, with the Veda and with Law.’

*Bṛhaspati* (1.5).—‘A Court of Justice is composed of ten members; and
an assembly of this sort, in which the King examines the cases
attentively, is comparable to a religious session.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.50-52).—‘The assembly in which there are seven, five,
or even three Brāhmaṇas versed in human affairs, the Vedas and the
Dharmaśāstras is like a sacrificial session.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.72).—‘The ten requisites in the administration of
justice are—the king, officers, councillors, smṛti-books, accountant,
clerk, gold, fire, water and one’s own men.’

*Nārada* (3.18).—‘That is not a court where there are no elders; they
are not elders who do not pass a just, sentence; that is not just
sentence where there is no truth; that is not truth which is vitiated by
error.’
