**(verses 8.345-347)  
**

*Nārada* (14-1 *et seq*.).—‘Whatever act is performed by persons
inflamed with strength is called *Violence*. Manslaughter, robbery,
indecent assault on another man’s wife, the two kinds of assault are the
four kinds of Violence. Destroying, reviling, disfiguring or otherwise
injuring fruits, roots, water and the like, or agricultural
implements............ The punishment to be inflicted for Violence shall
be proportionate to the heaviness of the crime, but it shall not be less
than a hundred.’
