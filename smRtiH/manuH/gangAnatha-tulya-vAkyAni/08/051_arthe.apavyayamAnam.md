*Viṣṇu* (6, 19-20).—‘If the debtor, forced to discharge the debt,
complains to the King, he shall be fined in an equal sum. If a creditor
sues before the King and fully proves his demand, the debtor shall pay
to the King, as fine, the tenth part of the sum proved.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.62).—‘A debtor denying his liability shall be compelled
to pay, on the debt being proved, in court, by a document or by
witnesses.’
