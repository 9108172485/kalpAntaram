*Viṣṇu* (5.94-96).—‘A fine of 25 *Kārṣāpaṇas* should he inflicted for
neglecting to invite at a *śrāddha*, a Brāhmaṇa neighbour; also for not
offering him food after inviting him. He who, after having accepted an
invitation, does not eat, shall pay a fine of a gold Māṣaka to the King,
and double the quantity of food to the inviter.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.263).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa omits to invite his neighbours, he
shall be fined 15 *Paṇas*.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 835).—‘If a twice-born who is in the habit
of accepting gifts, fails to attend an invitation, he should be made to
pay a fine of 108.’
