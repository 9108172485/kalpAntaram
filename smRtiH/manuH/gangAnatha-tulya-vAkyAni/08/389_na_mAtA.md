*Viṣṇu* (5.163).—‘A husband forsaking a blameless wife shall be punished
as a thief.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.237).—‘Between father and son, brother and sister,
husband and wife, teacher and disciple,—if one forsakes the other,
unless he or she has become an outcast, he shall be fined one hundred.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 823).—‘The father and the mother should
never be forsaken; indeed no Sapiṇḍas possessing good qualities should
be forsaken; if one forsakes these arbitrarily, unless they have become
outcasts, he should he fined 200. Nor should one misbehave towards the
father, mother, or teacher; one who misbehaves towards them shall have
his limb cut off.’
