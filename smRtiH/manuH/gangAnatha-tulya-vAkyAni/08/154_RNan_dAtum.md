*Nārada* (1.131, 134).—‘When a debtor has been disabled by a reverse of
fortune (from paying the debt), he shall be made to discharge the debt
gradually, according to bis means, as he happens to gain wealth. If the
debtor, owing to a calamity, has not means sufficient to discharge the
whole debt, the claim of the creditor shall be entered in a legal
document, specifying the caste (of the parties), their names and names
of their neighbours.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.47, 60).—‘A loan shall be restored on demand, if no time
has been fixed; or on the expiry of the time, if time has been fixed; or
when interest ceases. When the time fixed for payment has elapsed, and
the interest has ceased, the creditor may either recover his loan or
cause a new bond to be written in the form of compound interest.’

*Bhāradvāja* (Parāśaramādhava-Vyava., p. 193).—‘If the debtor has no
money to repay the debt, he shall liquidate it by giving grains, gold,
or cattle, or clothes, slaves or conveyances.’
