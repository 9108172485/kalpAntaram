*Gautama* (2.42-44).—‘As a rule, a pupil shall not be punished
corporally,—if no other course is possible, he may be corrected with a
thin rope or a thin cane; if the teacher strikes him with any other
thing, he should be punished by the King.’

*Āpastamba* (1.8.28-29).—‘If the pupil commits faults, the teacher shall
always reprove him;—frightening, fasting, bathing in cold water and
expulsion from the teacher’s presence are the punishments to be
employed, according to the seriousness of the fault, until the pupil
leaves off the mischief.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 2.).—‘Wife, son, slave, slave-girl and
pupil,—when these commit a fault, they should be chastised with a rope
or with split bamboo; but in the lower, never in the higher, parts of
the body:—if one strikes them otherwise, he should be punished.’

*Nārada* (*Do*.).—‘If the pupil does not obey the teacher, he should be
chastised, without hurting him, either with a thin rope or with split
bamboo; the teacher shall not beat him much, nor in the head or on the
chest. Behaving otherwise than this, the teacher should be punished by
the King.’
