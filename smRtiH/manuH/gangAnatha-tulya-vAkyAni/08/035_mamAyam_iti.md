*Viṣṇu* (3.63).—‘Of treasure anciently hidden by themselves, men of all
castes excepting Brāhmaṇas, shall give a twelfth part to the King.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.35).—‘When some one has discovered hidden treasure, the
King shall take the sixth part of it. In cases where the find is not
reported to the King, on coming to know of it, he shall take the whole
of it, and also fine the finder.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.13).—‘If anyone finds treasure, the owner of which is not
known, the King shall take it, giving one-sixth to the finder.’

*Gautama* (10.43-45).—‘Treasure-trove is the property of the
King,—excepting such as is found by a Brāhmaṇa who lives according to
the law. Some people declare that a finder belonging to a
non-Brāhmaṇical caste also, who reports the find to the King, shall
obtain the sixth part of its value.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 343).—‘If a man finds treasure hidden by
some one else, he shall take it to the King; all treasure-trove, to
whomsoever it may have belonged, should go to the King; except that
belonging to the Brāhmaṇa.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, pp. 269-270).—‘Having
obtained a treasure-trove, the King shall keep half of it in his
Treasury; and the other half the righteous King shall make over to
Brāhmaṇas.’
