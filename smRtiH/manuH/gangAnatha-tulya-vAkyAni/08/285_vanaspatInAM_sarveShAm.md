*Viṣṇu* (5.55-59).—‘A feller of trees yielding fruit shall pay the
highest amercement; a feller of flower-bearing trees, only the middle
amercement; he who cuts creepers, shrubs or climbing plants shall pay a
hundred *kārṣāpaṇas*; he who cuts grass shall pay one *kārṣāpaṇa*; and
all such offenders shall make good to the owners the revenue which they
yield.’

*Arthaśāstra* (pp. 108-109).—‘One who destroys small things shall make
good their value and also pay a line equal to it;—on destroying large
things, he shall make good their value and pay double that amount as
fine.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.227-229).—‘For tearing the branches of wide-spreading
trees, and of such trees as supply food, the fine shall he 20; for
tearing their trunks, 40, and for destroying the entire tree, 80. For
such trees as are growing on places of worship, in the cremation-ground,
in a sacred place, or in a temple, the fine shall be double. Half of the
above-mentioned fine, in the case of destroying thickets, creepers and
plants.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 286).—‘For the purpose of making
agricultural implements or implements for the household, one may cut
even fruit-bearing and flower-bearing trees and thickets.’
