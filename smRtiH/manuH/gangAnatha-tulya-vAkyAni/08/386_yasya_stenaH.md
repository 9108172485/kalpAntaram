**(verses 8.386-387)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (5.196).—‘The King in whose dominion there exists neither thief,
nor adulterer, nor calumniator, nor robber, nor murderer, attains the
world of Indra.’

*Cf*. The Upaniṣad text, where a king is represented as saying—‘In my
realm there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, none who is not tending
the Fires, nor any illiterate person, no female libertine,—whence then
can there be any male libertine.’

*Yama* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 408).—‘Wicked persons, criminals, rogues,
gamblers, oppressors,—that King in whose realm these persons are not
found becomes entitled to the realm of India.’

*Nārada* (18.7-8).—‘Whenever wicked acts, opposed to the dictates of the
sacred law, have been committed, the King, after having reflected upon
the matter, shall himself inflict punishment upon those who deserve it.
What is opposed to revealed and traditional law, or injurious to living
beings, must not be practised by the King; wherever it is practised, he
must check it.’
