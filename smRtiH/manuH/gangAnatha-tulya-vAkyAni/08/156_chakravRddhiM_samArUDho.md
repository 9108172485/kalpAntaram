**(verses 8.156-157)  
**

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 64).—‘For 100 *Paṇas*, the proper interest is ¼
*Paṇa*; 5 *Paṇas* for traders; 10 *Paṇas* for dealers in forests; 20
*Paṇas* for dealers on the seas.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2-38).—‘Dealers in forests should pay 10 per cent., and
dealers on the seas, 20 per cent.; or men may pay to all castes whatever
interest may have been agreed upon by themselves.’
