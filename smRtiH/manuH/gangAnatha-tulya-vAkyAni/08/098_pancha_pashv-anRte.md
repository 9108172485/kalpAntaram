*Baudhāyana* (1.19.12-13).—‘By false testimony regarding gold, he ruins
three ancestors; by false testimony regarding small cattle, he ruins
five; by false testimony regarding kine, he kills ten; he ruins a
hundred by false evidence regarding horses, and a thousand by false
evidence regarding man; a witness who speaks falsely about land ruins
the whole world.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (16.34).—‘He kills five by false testimony regarding a
maiden; ten by false testimony regarding kine, a hundred by false
testimony regarding a horse, and a thousand by false testimony regarding
a man.’

*Gautama* (13.14-15).—‘By false evidence concerning small cattle, a
witness kills ten; by that regarding cows, horses, men, or land,—in each
succeeding case, ten times as many as in the one preceding; or, by false
evidence regarding land, the whole human race.’
