*Arthaśāstra* (p. 103).—‘If one reviles a man as one-eyed, lame and so
forth when he is really so,—the fine is 3 *Paṇas*; if he is not so, it
is 6 *Paṇas*.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.27).—‘If a man is blind, with one eye, or lame, or defective
in any similar way,—and another calls him so,—the latter shall be fined
2 *kārṣāpāṇas*, though he speaks the truth.’

*Yājñavalkya*( 2-204).—‘If a man reviles another—either falsely or truly
or ironically—in regard to defective limbs or sense-organs or
diseases,—he shall he fined twelve and a half *Paṇas*.’

*Nārada* (15-16.18).—(Same as Manu.)
