*Viṣṇu* (6.20-22).—‘If a creditor sues before the King and fully proves
bis demand, the debtor shall pay as fine to the King a tenth part of the
sum proved. The creditor, having received the sum due, shall pay a
twentieth part of it. If the whole demand has been contested by the
debtor, and even a part of it only has been proved against him, he must
pay the whole.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Rājadharma, 227.4),—‘The man who, having received a
loan, does not repay it in due course, should be compelled to repay it,
and should also he fined the first amercement.’
