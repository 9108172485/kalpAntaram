**(verses 8.20-21)**

*Śukranīti* (4.5.27).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa he not learned enough, the King
should appoint a Kṣatriya or Vaiśya learned in the legal law;—but he
shall always avoid the Śūdra.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 601).—(Same as Manu.)

*Vyāsa* (Vyavahāratattva).—‘If the King, leaving the twice-born, tries
law-suits with the assistance of Śūdras, he falls.’
