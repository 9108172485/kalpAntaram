*Yājñavalkya* (2.113).—‘If a man suffers no calamity, arising either
from the King or from some supernatural force, within fourteen days (of
his deposition), he should undoubtedly be regarded as pure (honest).’

*Nārada* (Aparārka, p. 715).—‘If the man suffers some calamity after the
lapse of two weeks, he shall not be accused on that account (of
dishonesty).’

*Viṣṇu* (14.4-5).—‘He to whom any calamity happens within a fortnight or
three weeks—such as an illness, or fine, or death of a relative, or a
heavy visitation by the King,—should be known to be
dishonest,—otherwise, he should be known as honest.’

*Pitāmaha* (Aparārka, p. 715).—‘If within three days, or seven days, or
two weeks, some calamity befalls the man, he should be regarded as a
sinner. If he alone, and none other, should suffer from illness, or
death of a relative, or fine, this would be an indication of his sin.’
