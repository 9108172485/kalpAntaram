*Nārada* (4.122).—(Same as Manu.)

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 67).—‘When the debtor is openly
arrested and brought before the assembly of men and kept there till he
pays—this, being in consonance with the custom of the country, is called
*Legal Proceedings*. By beating, by arresting, by work, by law-suit, and
first of all, by peaceful persuasion,—should the creditor obtain
repayment of his dues.’

*Nārada* (1.122).—‘By the mode consonant with religion, by legal
proceedings, by fraud, by customary mode, and fifthly, by force, a
creditor may recover what he has lent.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11.54 *et seq*.).—‘When a debtor has admitted a debt, it
may he recovered from him by the expedients of friendly expostulation,
by moral suasion, by artful management, by compulsion and by confinement
in the house. When a debtor is caused to pay by the advice of friends
and kinsmen, by friendly remonstrances, by constant following, or by the
creditor starving himself, it is termed *Moral Suasion*. When a creditor
with a crafty design, borrows something from the debtor and withholds it
as a pledge, and thereby enforces payment of the debt, it is termed
*Artful Management*;—when the debtor is fettered and conducted to the
creditor’s house, where he is compelled by beating and other forcible
means, to pay the debt, it is called *Compulsion*;—when the debtor is
made to pay by confining his son, wife, or cattle, or by sitting at his
door, it is termed *Confinement in the* *House*.’
