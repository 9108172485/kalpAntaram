*Viṣṇu* (6.7-8).—‘The pledge shall be restored to the pledgee when the
interest has reached its maximum amount; but he should not use an
immovable pledge without special agreement.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.58).—‘The pledge becomes lost, if it is not redeemed on
the principal becoming doubled; if it had been given for a limited time,
it becomes lost on the lapse of that time; but there is no such losing
in the ease of pledges that have been given for the enjoyment of the
usufruct only.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.415).—‘The following cannot he lost by length of
adverse possession:—Pledge, boundary-land, minor’s property, trust
property, sealed deposit, female slaves, government property and
property of the Vedic scholar.’

*Bṛhaspati* (11, 25, 28).—‘When the time for payment has passed, and
interest has ceased, the creditor shall become the owner of the pledge;
hut till ten days have elapsed, the debtor is entitled to redeem it.
Notice having been given to the debtor’s family, a *pledge to be kept*
may he used after the principal has become doubled, and so may the
*pledge given for* a *fixed period*, on the expiry of that period. When
the principal has been doubled, or the stipulated period has expired, in
the case of the *pledge given for a fixed period*, the creditor becomes
owner of the pledge after having waited for a fortnight. If the debtor
should pay the debt during that interval, he may recover the pledge even
then.’
