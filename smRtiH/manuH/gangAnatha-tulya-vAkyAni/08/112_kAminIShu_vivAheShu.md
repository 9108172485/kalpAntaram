*Vaśiṣṭha* (16.35).—‘Men may speak an untruth in marriage, during
dalliance, when their lives are in danger, or the loss of their entire
property is imminent, and for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Gautama* (23.29-31).—‘Some declare that an untruth spoken in marriage,
during dalliance, in jest, or while one is in severe pain, is not
reprehensible. But that is certainly not the case when the untruth
concerns the *guru*; for if one lies even in his heart to his *guru*,
regarding even small matters, he destroys himself, his seven descendants
and seven ancestors.’
