*Nārada* (18.34-35).—‘Let a king be constantly intent on showing honour
to the Brāhmaṇas; a field furnished with Brāhmaṇas is the source of
prosperity of the world. A Brāhmaṇa may command respect and a
distinguished seat at the King’s court. In the morning, the King shall
show his face to, and salute, the Brāhmaṇa first of all.’
