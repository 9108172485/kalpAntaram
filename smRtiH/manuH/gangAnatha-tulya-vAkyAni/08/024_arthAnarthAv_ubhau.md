*Śukranīti* (4.5.113-117).—‘The King with the Ministers after receiving
the plaintiff duly should first console him and then commence the trial,
he should then enquire of the plaintiff standing submissively before him
—*What is your business? What is your complaint? Do not be afraid—by
what ruffian and under what circumstances hare you been molested?*’

*Bṛhaspati* (1.24).—‘Let the King, or a member of the twice-born caste
officiating as Chief-Judge, try causes, acting on principles of equity,
and abiding by the opinion of the judges, and by the doctrine of the
sacred law.’

*Nārada* (1.31, 31, 35).—‘A King who acts justly must reject error when
brought forward, and seek truth alone; because prosperity depends on the
discharge of duty. Therefore let a King, after having seated himself on
the seat of judgment, be equitable towards all beings, discarding
selfish interests and acting the part of Yama Vaivasvata. Attending to
the dictates of the Law, and adhering to the opinion of the Chief-Judge,
he should try causes in due order, exhibiting great care.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava- Vyasa, p. 46).—‘Where two complainants
arrive accusing each other and claiming the first hearing, the King
shall admit them, either in the order of their castes, or in accordance
with the comparative seriousness of the complaints.’

*Kātyāyana* (Do.).—‘Between two mutual complainants, that man should be
treated as the plaintiff whose hurt or complaint is more serious,—and
not necessarily the man who appears first before the court.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—(Same as Kātyāyana.)
