*Gautama* (10.43-45).—‘Treasure-trove is the property of the
King,—except that which is found by a Brāhmaṇa living according to
Law;—some declare that a non-Brahmaṇa also finding hidden treasure and
reporting it to the King, shall receive one-sixth of its value.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.13).—‘If any one finds treasure, the owner whereof is not
known, the King shall take it, giving one-sixth to the finder.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.58-62).—‘A Brāhmaṇa finding treasure shall keep it entire; a
Kṣatriya finding treasure must give one-fourth of it to the King,
another fourth to Brāhmaṇas and keep half to himself; a Vaiśya finding
treasure must give a fourth part to the King, one-half to Brāhmaṇas and
keep the remainder to himself. A Śūdra finding treasure should divide it
into twelve parts and give five parts to the King, five to Brāhmaṇas and
keep two parts to himself. Let the King compel him who having found
treasure does not report it to the King and is found out afterwards—to
give up the whole.’

*Y ājñavalkya* (2.35).—‘If some one else finds a treasure, the King
shall take the sixth part of it; if he has not reported it to the King
and is found out, he should be compelled to deliver the treasure and
also pay a line.’

*Agnipurāṇa* (222.14).—(See under 38.)
