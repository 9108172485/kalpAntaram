*Āpastamba* (2-26.18-19).—‘A young man who, decked with ornaments,
enters unintentionally a place where a married woman or a maiden sits,

ho must he fined.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.284).—‘If a man converses with a woman at improper
times or places,—or if he sits with her on the same seat,—this is

*Yājñavalkya* (2.285).—‘If a man converses with a woman who has been
previously forbidden to do so, the woman shall pay a fine of one hundred

punishment shall be the same as in the case of Adultery.’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 854).—‘Conversing with a woman at improper times

clothes,—and conversing with her in secret,—is considered an adulterous
act of the second degree.’
