*Yājñavalkaya* (2.65, 67).—‘If something contained in a basket is made
over in deposit to another person, without the contents being declared,
it is called a *Scaled Deposit*; it shall be restored to the owner in
exactly the same form in which it had ben deposited. This same rule
applies to ordinary deposits also.’

*Nārada* (2.3).—‘In whatever form may a man have delivered any of his
effects to another, in the same form shall that article be restored to
the owner; as the delivery so the recovery.’

*Nārada* (2.5).—‘If one article concealed in another is deposited in
another man’s house, without stating what it is, it is then a *Sealed
Deposit*.’

*Nārada* (2.6).—‘Deposits must he restored in precisely the same
condition.’

*Bṛhaspati* (12.3).—‘When a chattel enclosed in a cover and marked with
a seal is deposited, without describing its nature and quantity, and
without showing it, it is termed a *Sealed Deposit*.’

*Bṛhaspati* (12.9).—‘A deposit must be returned to the very man who
hailed it, in the very manner in which it was hailed.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 662).—‘Purchase-money, what is deposited by
one going on a long journey, a pledge, something handed over for being
delivered to a third party, what is given to another for the making of
something else, what is paid in connection with loan-transactions, all
this is called *Deposit*.’
