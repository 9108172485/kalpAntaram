*Yājñavalkya* (2.285).—‘If a man converses with a woman who has been
forbidden to do so, the woman shall be fined one hundred, and the man,
two hundred; if both have been previously forbidden, the punishment for
conversing shall be the same as in adultery.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 856).—‘A mendicant male or female, a
player,—if these enter the residence of women, after being forbidden,
they shall be fined two hundred; and the man who may have admitted them,
or who affords them the opportunity for entering, shall be punished like
an adulterer.’
