**(verses 8.25-26)**

*Nārada* (6.10-11).—‘When the face changes colour, or the voice falters,
or the features look suspicious, when they do not give evidence in
public, when they make impossible statements as to place and time, when
there are doubts regarding their place of residence, when they indulge
in expense for bad purposes, when they have been previously convicted of
larceny, when they keep bad company, or when documents speak against
them,—they may be convicted as thieves,—not by the possession of stolen
goods alone.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.13-15).—‘If he shifts his position, licks the ends of
his mouth, perspires in his forehead, his face becomes pale, speech is
dry and halting, talks much and inconsistently, is not pleasant in the
eye or in his speech, twists his lips, the natural condition of his
mind, speech and body becomes changed,—such a person, whether he be a
complainant or a witness, should be regarded as at fault or wicked.’

*Rāmāyaṇa* (Vyavahāratattva, p. 31).—‘The man cannot hide his internal
feelings entirely, without showing some slight shadow of it in his
external appearance; it becomes exposed even against his will.’
