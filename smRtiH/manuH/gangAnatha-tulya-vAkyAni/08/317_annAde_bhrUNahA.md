*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.44).—‘They quote the following verse:—“The slayer of a
learned Brāhmaṇa casts his guilt on him who eats his food; a misbehaving
wife on her husband; a student and a sacrificer on the teacher and the
officiating priest; and a thief on the King.” The guilt falls on the
King who pardons an offender, if he causes him to he slain, he destroys
sin in accordance with the sacred law.’

*Āpastamba* (1.19.15).—‘They quote the following:—“The murderer of a
Brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda heaps his guilt on his guest; an innocent
man on his calumniator; a thief set at liberty, on the King; and the
petitioner, on him who makes false promises.”
