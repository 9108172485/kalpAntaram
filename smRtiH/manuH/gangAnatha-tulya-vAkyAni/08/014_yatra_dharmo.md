*Nārada* (3.89).—‘Where justice hit by injustice enters a Court, and the
members do not extract the dart from the wounds, they are hit by it
themselves. Where justice is slain by injustice, and truth by falsehood,
the members of the Court who look on with indifference, become doomed to
destruction.’

*Kātyāyana* (Aparārka, p. 604).—(Same as Nārada.)
