*Bṛhaspati* (12.14).—‘When a dispute arises with regard to a deposit
privately made, the performance of an ordeal is ordained for both
parties, to establish the facts of the case.’

*Nārada* (2.11).—‘The rightful owner shall try to recover the deposit
amicably, without resorting to stratagems. Or, he shall explore the
depositary’s mode of living and cause him to restore it by friendly
expostulations.’
