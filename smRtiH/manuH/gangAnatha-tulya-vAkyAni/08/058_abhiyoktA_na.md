*Nārada* (2.2).—‘Tho defendant, immediately after having become
acquainted with the plaint, shall write down his answer, which must
correspond to the tenour of the plaint; or, let him deliver his answer
on the next day, or in three days, or in seven days.’

*Bṛhaspati* (4.1-6).—‘When the plaint has been well-defined, a clear
exposition given of what is claimed and what not, and the meaning of the
plaint fully established, the judge shall cause the answer to be
submitted by the defendant. If the defendant does not make an answer
fully meeting the contents of the plaint, he shall be compelled to pay
by gentle remonstrance and other methods;—kindly speeches constitute
*gentle remonstrance*, intimidation is *pointing out danger*.’ *Force*
consists of depriving one of his property, or striking or confining him.
When a man makes no answer, even though all methods have been employed,
he is defeated and liable to punishment after a week. When the defendant
asks for time, through timidity or terror or failing memory, time shall
be granted to him. He shall bo allowed time extending to one day, or
three days, or five days, or seven days, or a fortnight, or a month, or
three seasons, or a year, according to his circumstances.’
