*Yājñavalkya* (2.265).—(See under 206.)

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 120).—‘After a Priest has been
appointed, if the sacrificer appoint another, the fee shall be paid to
the former; if he happen to go out for some time, then his return shall
be awaited, and the sacrificer shall not go on with the performance
during his absence. If the completion of the performance becomes urgent,
he may have it completed; and on his return, the priest may be given
some fee.’

*Nārada* (3.8-11).—‘When an officiating priest has met with an accident,
another priest shall officiate for him, and receive from him his part of
the fee. Where an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer, who is no
offender and is free from guilt,—or when a sacrificer forsakes a
faultless priest,—they shall both be punished. There are three sorts of
officiating priests: hereditary, appointed by the sacrificer himself,
and one who performs the priestly functions of his own accord, through
friendship; the above law applies to the hereditary and appointed
priests; no sin attaches to the forsaking of the priest acting of his
own accord.’
