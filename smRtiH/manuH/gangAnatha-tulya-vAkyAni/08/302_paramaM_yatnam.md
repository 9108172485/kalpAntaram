*Āpastamba* (2.25.15).—‘That King only takes care of the welfare of his
subjects in whose dominions, be it in villages or forests, there is no
danger from thieves.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.190).—‘A king in whose dominion there exists neither thief,
nor adulterer, nor calumniator, nor robber, nor murderer, attains the
world of Indra.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.335).—‘He should guard his people against the attacks
of calumniators, thieves, evil-doers, and great criminals,—specially
those of Kāyasthas.’

*Hārīta* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 294).—‘If in the dominion of a king wicked
thieves prosper, that evil, reaching large proportions, destroys the
very roots of that king.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 256).—‘The King should
save his people from the ravages of prostitutes, talkers, evil-doers,
royal favourites, and specially, Kāyasthas.’
