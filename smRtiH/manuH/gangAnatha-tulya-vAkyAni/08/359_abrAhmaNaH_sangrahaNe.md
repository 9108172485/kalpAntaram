*Baudhāyana* (2.4.1-2).—‘Anybody but a Brāhmaṇa shall suffer corporal
punishment for Adultery;—the wives of men of all castes must be guarded
more carefully than wealth.’

*Āpastamba* (2.26.20).—‘If a man has actually committed adultery, his
organ shall be cut off together with the testicles.’

*Bṛhaspati* (23.10-12).—‘If a man violates an unwilling woman, the King
shall confiscate his entire property, have his penis and scrotum cut off
and have him paraded on an ass. When a man enjoys a woman by fraud, bis
punishment shall be confiscation of his entire wealth; and afterwards he
shall be branded with the mark of the female organ and banished from the
town. The highest fine shall be inflicted for connexion with a woman of
equal caste; half that for connexion with a woman of a lower caste; and
a man who has connexion with a woman of a higher caste shall be put to
death.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 389).—‘When a man has completed his
intercourse with the woman, by force, the penalty of death shall be
inflicted.’

*Vyāsa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 392).—‘If a man has intercourse with a
woman who comes to him of her own accord, the punishment shall be half
of that in the case of the woman being unwilling.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 172).—‘A man shall never take liberties with an
unwilling woman; if he has illicit intercourse with a willing woman, he
shall be fined 50 Paṇas, and the woman, half of that.’
