*Yājñavalkya* (2.259).—‘Among traders carrying on a joint concern for
profit, their profit and loss shall be commensurate with the share of
capital contributed by each.’

*Nārada* (3.1-3).—When traders or others carry on business jointly, it
is called *Partnership*. When several partners are jointly carrying on
business for the purpose of profit, the contribution of funds towards
the common stock of the association shall form the basis of their
undertakings. Therefore let each contribute his proper share. The loss,
expenses and profit of each partner are either equal to those of other
partners or exceed them, or remain below them, according as his share is
equal to theirs, or greater or less.’

*Bṛhaspati* (14.3).—‘As an equal, smaller, or larger share of the joint
stock has been contributed by a partner, in the same proportion shall he
defray charges, perform labour and obtain profit.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.614-618).—‘Those who deal in gold, grains and liquids,
jointly, will have the earnings according to the amount of their share,
greater, equal or less. Whatever portion has been stipulated
beforehand,—equal, less or greater,—that shall he accepted. Expenditure
he shall pay and do the labour also proportionately, and take the profit
also in the same manner.’
