**(verses 8.404-406)**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.21, Vivādaratnākara, p. 639).—‘The toll for crossing a
river whose width is within an arrow-reach is 8 *māṣas*; for crossing a
river whose width is more than an arrow-reach is a quarter of a
*Kārṣāpaṇa*; and that for crossing a river in which there is scanty
water, it is one *māṣa*; it is to be one and a half times these in the
case of women...... If a man swims a river-crossing, he should he made
to pay a sum hundred times of the toll.’
