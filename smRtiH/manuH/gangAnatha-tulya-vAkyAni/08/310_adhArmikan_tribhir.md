**(verses 8.310-311)**

*Nārada* (Theft, 61).—‘Let the King practise the duties of his office,
and follow the rule of inflicting punishments, faithful to the tenets of
the sacred law. Let him accordingly, as governor, destroy the
evil-doers, after having traced them by the application of cunning
stratagems and arrested them.’

*Bṛhaspati* (27.4 *et seq*.).—‘When he has discovered an offender, the
King shall inflict one of the various kinds of punishments on him,
*viz*., gentle admonition, harsh reproof, corporal punishment, or one of
the four gradations of fines; he shall inflict gentle admonition when
the offence is very light; harsh reproof, for a crime of the first
degree; a fine for crime of the middle degree, and arrest in the case of
high treason. Banishment also may be resorted to by the King.’
