*Viṣṇu* (8.20-23).—‘The Brāhmaṇa witness should be asked to *declare*:
the Kṣatriya to *declare the truth*; the Vaiśya should be addressed
thus—“*Thy kine*, *grain and gold shall yield thee no fruit if thou wert
to lie*”: the Śūdra should be addressed thus—“*Thou shall have to atone
for all heavy crimes if thou wert to lie*.”’

*Nārada* (1.248).—‘Let him cause the Brāhmaṇa to swear by truth, the
Kṣatriya by his conveyance and by his weapons, the Vaiśya by his gold,
grains, cows and so forth; or all by venerable deities or deified
ancestors, or by their own pious gifts or meritorious deeds.’
