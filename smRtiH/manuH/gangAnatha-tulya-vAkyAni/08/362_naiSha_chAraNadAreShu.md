*Baudhāyana* (2.4.3).—‘Corporal punishment shall not be inflicted for
adultery with the wives of minstrels and play-actors; for their husbands
themselves either actually lead them to other men, or concealed at home,
permit them to hold culpable intercourse.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.293).—‘For approaching a female ascetic, the fine is
twenty-four *Paṇas*.’
