*Yājñavalkya* (2.162).—‘If cattle graze in a field on the road-side, or
near the village pasture-land, there is no offence, if it goes there by
chance, and not intentionally on the part of the cowherd.’

*Nārada* (11.40).—‘When a field is situated on the borders of a village,
or contiguous to the pasture-land, or adjacent to a high road, the
herdsman is not reprehensible for any damage to the crops, if the field
is not protected by a fence.’

*Gautama* (12.21).—‘If damage is done in an unenclosed field near the
road, the responsibility falls on the herdsman and on the owner of the
field.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.147-148).—‘There is no offence if the damage has been done
near a highway, or near a village, or in a field adjacent to the
pasture-ground; or if it has been done in an unenclosed field.’
