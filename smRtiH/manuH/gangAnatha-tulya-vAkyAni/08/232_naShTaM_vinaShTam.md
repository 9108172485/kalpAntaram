*Viṣṇu* (5.138).—‘The cowherd shall make good to the owner the value of
the cattle that may have perished.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.165).—‘If a cattle is destroyed through the fault of
the cowherd, he shall be fined 13½ *Paṇas* and made to make good the
value of the cattle to the owner.’

*Nārada* (6.13-15).—‘Should the cowherd neither struggle to save the
cow, nor raise a cry, nor announce it to his master, he must make good
the value of the cow to the owner, and pay a fine to the King. The
cowherd shall make good the value of the cow that has strayed, or been
destroyed by worms, or slain by dogs, or met her death by tumbling into
a pit,—if he did not duly exert himself to prevent such accidents.’

*Brahmapurāṇa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 171).—‘If a cowherd who has received
wages leaves the cattle in the desolate forest and roams about in the
village, he should be beaten by the King. If a cow under the charge of a
cowherd dies through his fault, he should be punished and made to pay a
fee to the owner of the cow. If however the cow dies at the house of the
owner, through disease or such causes, the owner should he punished and
made to pay the wages of the cowherd.’

*Āpastamba* (2.28.6).—‘If a herdsman who has taken cattle under his
care, allows them to perish, or loses them through his negligence, he
shall make them good to the owners.’
