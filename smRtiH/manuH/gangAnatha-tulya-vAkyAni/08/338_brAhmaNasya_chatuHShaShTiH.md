*Gautama* (12.15-17).—‘The value of property which a Śūdra unrighteously
acquires by theft, must be repaid eightfold;—for each of the other
castes, the fine shall be doubled; if a learned man offends, the
punishment shall be very much enhanced.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 51-52).—‘In theft, the crime of the *Śūdra* is eight
times (that of the lowest caste); of the *Vaiśya*, sixteen-fold; of the
*Kṣatriya*, thirty-two-fold; of the Brāhmaṇa sixty-four-fold—Knowledge
also makes a difference; for knowing persons, the punishment is
specially severe.’
