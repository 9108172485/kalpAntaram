**(verses 8.295-298)**

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 284).—‘If any animal happen to be
killed, the man should be made to pay a fine according to the character
of the animal killed, and the value of the animal to its owner.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.50-54).—‘He who kills domestic animals shall pay a fine of
100 *kārṣāpaṇaṣ*;—he shall make good their value to the owner; be who
kills wild animals shall pay 500 *kārṣāpaṇas*; a killer of birds or
fish, ten *kārṣāpaṇas*; a killer of insects, one *kārṣāpaṇa*.’
