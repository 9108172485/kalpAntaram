*Gautama* (13.27).—‘The litigant shall humbly go to seek the judge.’

*Pitāmaha* (Smṛticandrikā-Vyavahāra, p. 61).—‘The King shall not himself
or through his officers, promote law-suits; nor through anger or through
greed or through affection, shall he suppress a suit; nor shall he, on
his own account, institute suits not brought up by the parties
concerned.’

*Nārada* (Do.).—‘The King shall not, either for asserting his power or
through greed for making money out of it, create law-suits among people
who have no disputes among themselves.’
