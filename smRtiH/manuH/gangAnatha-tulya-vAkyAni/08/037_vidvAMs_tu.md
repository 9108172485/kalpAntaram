*Gautama* (10.43-44).—‘Treasure-trove is the property of the
King;—excepting such as is found by a Brāhmaṇa who lives according to
the Law.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.14).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa following the six lawful
qualifications finds the treasure, the King shall not take it.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.58).—‘A Brāhmaṇa who has found treasure may keep it entire.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.34).—‘The learned Brāhmaṇa shall take the treasure;
since he is the master of all.’

*Nārada* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 643).—‘If a man comes by treasure hidden
by another, he shall present it to the King; as all Treasure-trove is
the property of the King, except what belongs to the Brāhmaṇa. The
Brāhmaṇa also, coming by hidden treasure, shall report it to the King,
and it is only when it is made over to him by the King that he should
enjoy it; if he failed to report the find, he would be a thief.’

*Agnipurāṇa* (222. 14).—‘The Brāhmaṇa finding hidden treasure, shall
take it all to himself.’
