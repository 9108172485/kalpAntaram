**(verses 8.16-17)**

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti, 90.16).—‘Justice is the sacred Bull, *Vṛṣa*; he
who brings about his destruction, *laya*, is called the *Vṛṣala*;
therefore one should never renounce justice.’

Do. (Anuśāsana, 173.14.16).—‘When one abandons his body, Dharma alone
goes with him. Dharma is the only helper for men in the other world.’
