*Yājñavalkya* (2.251-253).—‘Sales should be carried on according to the
prices fixed by the King day by day; whatever profit accrues from such
sale is lawful for the trader. In the case of commodities purchased in
the country itself, the merchant shall take a profit of 5 per cent.; and
in that of those imported from outside, 10 per cent.; this rule applies
to commodities bought and sold quickly. The King shall consider the
intrinsic value of the merchandise and the cost incurred in its
marketing and then fix a price which shall be favourable alike to the
vendor and the vendee.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 302).—‘Fixing of weights and
measures, and the fixing of the price of commodities shall be placed in
charge of a trustworthy official.’
