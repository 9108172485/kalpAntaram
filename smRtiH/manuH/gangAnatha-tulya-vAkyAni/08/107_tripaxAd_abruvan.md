*Gautama* (13.6).—‘If witnesses, on being asked, do not answer, they are
guilty of a crime.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.76).—‘A person not deposing as a witness should be made
to pay, on the forty-sixth day, the entire amount of the debt (involved
in the suit), along with the tenth part of that amount as penalty.’

*Bṛhaspati* (7.31).—‘If a witness, who is not ill, being summoned, does
not make his appearance, he should be made to pay the debt and also a
fine, after the lapse of three fortnights.’

*Nārada* (1.197).—‘He who conceals his knowledge at the time of trial,
although previously he has stated to others what he knows, deserves
specially heavy punishment; for he is more criminal than a false
witness.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.387).—‘The man who, when summoned, does not bear
witness is punishable.’
