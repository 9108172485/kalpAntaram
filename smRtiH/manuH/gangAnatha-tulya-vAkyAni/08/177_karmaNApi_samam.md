*Bṛhaspati* (11.59).—‘An indigent debtor may be taken by the creditor to
his own house and compelled to work there, such as distilling spirits
and the like; but a Brāhmaṇa should be made to pay gradually.’

*Nārada* (1.132).—“If a wealthy debtor, from malice, refuses to pay his
debt, the King shall compel him to pay it by forcible means, and shall
take five in the hundred for himself.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.43)—‘If the debtor of a lower caste is too indigent to
pay, the creditor shall make him do work; but an indigent Brāhmaṇa
should he made to pay gradually, as he obtains the means to pay.’
