*Bṛhaspati* (11.9, 10-12).—‘That interest has always to be paid which
has been stipulated by the debtor himself, over and above the ordinary
rate of interest, and has been promised in times of distress; when such
special interest has been stipulated in any other manner, it must not be
paid by any means. The use of a pledge after twice the principal has
been realised from it, compound interest, and the exaction of the
principal and interest together (as principal) are usury and are
reprehensible.’
