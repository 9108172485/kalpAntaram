*Bṛhaspati* (1.21-23).—‘The King having risen early in the morning and
performed ablutions according to rule, and having shown due honour to
elders, astronomers, physicians, deities, Brāhmaṇas and domestic
priests,—should enter the Court-room, decorated with flowers, ornaments
and fine clothes, with a cheerful countenance. Having entered the Court
in the forenoon, together with the elders, ministers and attendants, he
should try cases and listen to the exposition of Purāṇas, Law-Codes and
Rules of Policy.’

*Śukranīti* (4.5.85-87).—‘The King should enter the Court modestly,
together with the Brāhmaṇas and the Ministers versed in state-craft,
with the object of investigating cases. He should proceed with the work
after taking the seat of justice.’

*Saṃvarta* (Smṛticandrikā-Vyavahāra).—‘Bowing to the Guardians of the
Regions, the King shall enter the splendid Court and carry on the work
of protecting the people by looking into their suits.’
