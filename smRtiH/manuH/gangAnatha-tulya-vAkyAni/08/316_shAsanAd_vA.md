*Saṃvarta* (Aparārka, p. 1079).—(See above.)

*Bodhāyana* (2.1-17).—‘Whether he be punished or be pardoned, the thief
becomes freed from his guilt. But if the King does not punish him, the
guilt of the thief falls upon him.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.41).—‘It is declared in the Veda that the thief becomes
purified by death caused with the club offered to him by the King.’

*Gautama* (12.44-45).—‘Whether he be slain or pardoned, he becomes
purified of his guilt. If the King does not strike him, the guilt falls
on the King.’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.4-5).—‘... If the thief dies, his sin is expiated. If
he is forgiven by the King, the guilt falls upon him who forgives him.’

*Viṣṇu* (52.2).—‘Whether the King kills the thief with the club, or
dismisses him unhurt, he becomes purified.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.257).—(See under 314-315.)

*Nārada* (Theft).—‘By going to the King and confessing his guilt, the
thief becomes purified. The King shall touch him with a club, or dismiss
him; in either case he becomes purified. Those men who have received a
punishment from the King for an offence committed by them, proceed to
heaven, free from sin, as if they were virtuous men who have acted well.
Whether he be punished or released, the thief is freed from his crime;
if, however, the King does not punish him. the guilt of the thief falls
on the King himself.’
