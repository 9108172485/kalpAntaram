*Gautama* (12.28).—‘One may take as one’s own, grass for a cow, and fuel
for his fire; as also flowers of creepers and trees and their fruit, if
these be unfenced.’

*Āpastamba* (1.28.1-6).—‘He who, under any condition whatsoever, covets
and takes another man’s property is a *thief*; thus teach Kautsa and
Hārīta, as well as Kaṇva and Puskarsādi. Vārsyāyani declares that there
are exceptions to this law, in regard to some things;—*e.g*., seeds
ripening in the pod, food for a draught-ox; if these are taken, the
owner should not forbid it. To take even these in large quantities is
sinful. Hārīta declares that in every case the permission of the owner
must he obtained first.’

*Yājñavalkya* (2.166).—‘Grass, fuel and flowers, the twice-born may take
from all places.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 774).—‘Grass, wood, flower or fruit—if one
takes any of these without permission, he deserves to have his hand cut
oil.’

*Nārada* (Theft, 22-24).—‘For stealing, wood, cane, grass and the
like...... vegetables, green roots, grass or flowers... a fine of five
times the value of the article stolen.’
