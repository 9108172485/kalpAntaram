*Vaśiṣṭha* (19.42-45).—‘If an innocent person is punished, the domestic
priest shall perform a *Kṛcchra* penance; and the King shall fast during
three days and nights.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.356, 358).—‘Punishment illegally inflicted by the King
destroys heaven, fame and worldly prosperity; legally inflicted, it
brings to the King heaven, fame and victory. If the King punishes those
who deserve punishment, and if he kills those who deserve to be killed,
he offers, thereby, sacrifices at which excellent sacrificial fees are
given.’

*Nārada* (Punishments, 61).—‘Let the King, faithful to the tenets of the
sacred law, practise the duties of his office and follow the rule of
inflicting punishment. Let him destroy, as governor, the evil-doers,
after having traced them by cunning stratagems and arrested them.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 649).—‘By not chastising evil-doers,
and by punishing those who are already submissive, kings and ministers
incur sin.’
