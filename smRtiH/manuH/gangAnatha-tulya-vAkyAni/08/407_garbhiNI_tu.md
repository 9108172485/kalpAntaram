*Nārada* (18.38).—‘The Brāhmaṇa has the right to cross rivers without
paying toll, and to be conveyed to the other side before others. When
engaged in trading, if he uses a ferry boat, he shall have to pay no
toll.’

*Viṣṇu* (5.132-133).—‘A ferry-man, or a toll-official, who takes a fare
or toll from a student or an ascetic or a renunciate, or a pregnant
woman, or one going on pilgrimage,—shall he fined 10 Paṇas,—and he shall
restore the toll to them.’
