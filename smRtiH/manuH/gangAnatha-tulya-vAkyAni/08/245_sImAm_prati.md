*Yājñavalkya* (2.151).—‘They should determine the boundary as indicated
by a mound, coal, chaff or trees; as also by dikes, ant-hills, pits,
bones, stone-piles and such other things.’

*Nārada* (11.4-5).—‘They shall determine the boundary in accordance with
old landmarks, chaff of grain, coal, potsherds, wells, sanctuaries,
trees,—objects of general notoriety, such as ant-hills, artificial
mounds, slopes, hills and the like, fields, gardens, roads and old
dikes.’

*Bṛhaspati* (19.2-6).—‘The determination of boundaries should be settled
at the time of foundation, and it should be marked by visible and
invisible signs, so as to dispel all doubt. Wells, tanks, pools, large
trees, gardens, temples, mounds, channels, the course of a river, sands,
shrubs, or piles of stones;—by such visible signs as these a boundary
line should always be marked; also by other marks deposited underground,
which the earth is not likely to destroy;—such as dry cowdung, bones,
chaff, charcoal, stones, potsherds, sand, bricks, cow’s tails,
cotton-seeds and ashes; after having placed these substances in vessels
one should deposit them there underground at the extremities of the
boundary.’
