*Śukranīti* (4.5.53, 55).—‘The man who knows Dharma can speak, whether
appointed or not appointed. Either one should not come to the Court, or
should speak truthfully. That man is a sinner who keeps silent or utters
falsehood.’

*Nārada* (3.10).—‘Either the judicial assembly must not be entered at
all, or a fair opinion should be delivered. That man who stands mute or
delivers an opinion contrary to justice, is a sinner.’

*Nārada* (3.14).—‘He who, having entered the Court, delivers a strange
opinion, ignoring the true state of the case, resembles a blind man who,
regardless, swallows fish together with the bones.’
