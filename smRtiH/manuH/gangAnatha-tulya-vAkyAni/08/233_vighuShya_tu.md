*Nārada*.—(6.12, 16).—‘If a cow under the cowherd’s charge meets with am
accident, he shall struggle to save her as best he may. If he is unable
to rescue her, he shall hasten to announce the fact to his master. For
an animal seized by robbers, though he raised a cry, the cowherd shall
not be made to pay; provided he gives notice to his master at the proper
time and place.’

*Vyāsa* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 172).—‘If a cattle perishes or is taken
away, when the cowherd has been captured, or during an attack on the
village, or during anarchy,—the cowherd shall not he held to blame.’
