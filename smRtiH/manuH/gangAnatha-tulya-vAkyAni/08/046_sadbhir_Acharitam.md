*Gautama* (11.20).—‘The laws of countries, castes and families, which
are not opposed to sacred texts, have authority.’

*Āpastamba* (2.15.1).—‘The law of custom observed in particular
countries and families.’

*Kātyāyana* (Smṛticandrikā-Vyavahāra, p. 58).—‘Therefore the King shall
decide suits according to the scriptures; in the absence of texts
bearing upon the subject, he shall come to a decision on the basis of
the custom obtaining in the land. That is called the *custom* of a land
which has been followed for all time and which is not repugnant to Śruti
or Smṛti.’

*Pitāmaha* (Smṛticandrikā-Vyavahāra, p. 58).—‘Whatever is done by the
elders,—be it right or wrong,—in accordance with the practice prevalent
in the land or in the family, is called *custom*. For villages,
corporations, cities, guilds, traders and army, suits should be dealt
with according to custom;—so says Bṛhaspati. When the dispute lies
between parties belonging to these same corporations, etc., their custom
is the determining factor; but when it lies between them and others,
then it is to be dealt with according to the scriptures.’
