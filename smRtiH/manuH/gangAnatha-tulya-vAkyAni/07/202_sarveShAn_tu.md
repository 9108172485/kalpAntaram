*Viṣṇu* (3.47).—‘The King having captured the capital of his enemy,
should invest a prince of the royal race of that country with the royal
dignity. He shall not extirpate the royal race, unless the royal race be
of low descent.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 411).—‘Even though the enemy may
have been wicked, the conqueror should not destroy the Kingdom.’
