**(verses 7.116-117)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (12.87.4, 5).—(Same as Manu.)

*Viṣṇu* (3.11-15).—‘If any offence has been committed in a village, the
lord of the village shall suppress the evil; if he is unable to do so,
he shall report it to the lord of ten villages; if he too is unable, he
shall report it to the lord of hundred villages; if he too is unable, he
shall report it to the lord of the whole district; the lord of the
district must eradicate the evil to the best of his power.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 250).—\[The same as
*Viṣṇu*, down to the ‘lord of the district,’ then\]—The lord of the
district shall report it to the king, if he is himself unable to deal
with it; the king shall himself take the necessary measures, and protect
the people of the province in every way.’
