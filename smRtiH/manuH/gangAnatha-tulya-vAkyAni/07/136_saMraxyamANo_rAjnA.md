*Vaśiṣṭha* (1.44).—‘He obtains the sixth part of the merit of sacrifices
and charitable works.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.27).—‘They pay him taxes in the shape of their pious acts.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 113).—‘That king among whose subjects
are Brāhmaṇas who recite the Veda at the first and the last parts of the
night, shines and prospers, on that account, along with his kingdom,
with Brahmanic glory. If the king, by chance, commit any sin, the
Brāhmaṇas residing in his realm, allay it by their recitations. livery
morning on rising, the king shall honour the Brāhmaṇas; it is by virtue
of the favour of Brāhmaṇas that, the gods remain in heaven. The glory of
Brāhmaṇas is endless; therefore shall the king regularly offer obeisance
to Brāhmaṇas.’
