**(verses 7.96-98)

*Gautama* (1.20-23).—‘The victor shall receive the booty gained in
battle. But chariots and riding animals belong to the king, also a
preferential share; except when the booty has been gained in single
combat, the king shall equally divide all other spoils.’

*Āditya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 409).—‘Having satisfied the
??ng (King?) in the battle, and having won the booty from Kṣatriyas
killed in battle, if the soldier does not take to himself any of the
booty, he goes to heaven. If the king who having conquered a kingdom but
desisting from taking any booty therefrom, happen to be killed, be goes
to heaven.’
