*Kāmandaka* (1.62).—‘The prosperity of a king who keeps his passion
under control and who follows the path chalked out by the Science of
Government always shines; his fame also reaches the heavens.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 37).—‘The control of the senses is at the root of
learning and discipline; this control should he acquired by the
abandonment of desires, anger, greed, pride, vanity and pleasure. The
control of the senses consists in avoiding the improper activities of
the Auditory, Tactile, Visual, Gustatory and Olfactory organs towards
their respective objects, sound, touch, colour, taste and odour; or it
may consist in making them act according to the scriptures; the whole
purpose of the scriptures lies in the control of the senses.’

*Śukranīti* (1.301).—‘Of the monarch who has conquered his senses and
who follows the Nītiśāstra, prosperity is in the ascendant and fame
reaches the skies.’

*Kāmandaka* (5.36).—‘A king, conversant with notions of justice and
injustice, having subdued his mind already powerless through the
subjugation of the senses, should exert himself for realising his own
good.’
