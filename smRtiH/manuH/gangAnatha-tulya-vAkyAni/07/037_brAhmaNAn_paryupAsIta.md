*Viṣṇu* (3.76).—‘He should constantly show reverence to the gods and to
the Brāhmaṇas.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 10).—‘He shall fix upon the Teachers and the Ministers
as checks upon himself; as these would save him from improper positions
and would regulate his activities by indicating the passage of time by
means of shadows or time-sticks. Kingship is dependent upon assistant; a
chariot never moves on a single wheel; therefore the king shall appoint
ministers and listen to their opinions.’
