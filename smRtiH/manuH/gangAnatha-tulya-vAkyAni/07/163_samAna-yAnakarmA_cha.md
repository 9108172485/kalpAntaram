**(verse 7.162)**

*Kāmandaka* (4.68, 74).—‘The King should form alliance with a person,
illustrious, well-spoken, benevolent, learned, even-minded, having
numerous partisans and expected to remain constant in faithfulness at
all times. Friends are of four kinds—derived from birth, relationship,
ancestral obligations and protection from danger.’

**(verse 7.163)**

*Kāmandaka* (9.5, etc.).—‘Peace concluded between two parties of equal
resources is called *Kapāla-sandhi*. The peace concluded through the
offer of presents is called *Upahāra*. *Santāna-sandhi* is that
concluded by the king by giving his daughter in marriage to his royal
adversary. That peace is called *Saṅgata-sandhi* which is founded on
friendship; this is also called *Kāñcana*. Peace that is concluded with
a view to putting a stop to all outstanding controversies has been named

*Upanyāsa*. “If I do him good, he will do the same to me.”—Peace
concluded under this consideration is called *Pratīkāra-sandhi*. When
two parties join one another for the accomplishing of common interests
and, if they enjoy mutual confidence,—this peace is called *Samyoga*,
etc.
