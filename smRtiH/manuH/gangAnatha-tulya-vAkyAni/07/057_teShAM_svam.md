*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 178).—‘In a kingdom when
ministers, courtiers and physicians are given to flattery, the king
shall certainly lose his kingdom, his righteousness and his happiness.
The king shall not evince displeasure at anything that they say; because
it is their duty to say what is right and according to law.’

*Kāmandaka* (11.77).—‘A king seeking his own welfare should discuss the
subject of consultation severally with each of his ministers; after
which he should take into serious consideration the opinion expressed by
each.’
