*Yājñavalkya* (1.321).—‘For the king there is no act more meritorious
than this that what he obtains by war he gives away to Brāhmaṇas and the
gift of fearlessness to the people.’

*Kāmandaka* (5.78, 79).—‘Agriculture, communications to facilitate
commercial traffic, entrenchment of strongholds for soldiers in the
capital, construction of dams and bridges across rivers, erection of
enclosures for elephants, working of mines and quarries, felling and
selling of timber and the peopling of uninhabited tracts,—these
eightfold sources of revenue, the king should ever enhance; his officers
looking up to him for livelihood should also do so, for maintaining
themselves.’
