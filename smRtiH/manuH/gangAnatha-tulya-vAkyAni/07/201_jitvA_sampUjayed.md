*Śukranīti* (4.7, 801, *et seq*.).—‘When a territory has been acquired,
the king should grant maintenances for the conquered king himself; half
of it to his son, and a quarter of it to his wife; the rest of the
income he shall retain for himself. He should maintain the dispossessed
princes for the display of his own majesty, by the bestowal of honours,
if they are well-behaved; but punish them, if they are wicked.’
