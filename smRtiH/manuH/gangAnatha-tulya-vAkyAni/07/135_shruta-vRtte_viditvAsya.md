*Yājñavalkya* (3.44).—‘Having found out all about his conduct, race,
character, learning, knowledge, austerities and family,—the king shall
ordain livelihood for him.’

*Dakṣa* (Aparārka, p. 939).—‘Father, mother, teacher, wife, the poor,
one seeking shelter, guest, fire, relations—maternal and paternal, the
emaciated, one who has no supporter,—these are persons that should bo
fed by every rich person; gifts should be made to the learned, otherwise
one would go to hell.’

*Gautama* (10.9-12).—‘He shall support Vedic scholars and Brāhmaṇas;—and
non-Brāhmaṇas who are unable to work;—and those who arc free from taxes,
and the ordinary Religious Students.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 142).—‘The Brāhmaṇas keep intact the
unbreakable, imperishable, indestructible ancient treasure (of the
Veda); the king shall therefore honour them and thereby become
unconquerable, like the King of the Gods.’
