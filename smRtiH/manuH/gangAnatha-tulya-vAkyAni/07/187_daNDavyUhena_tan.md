*Śukranīti* (4.7.551 *et seq*.).—‘The *Krauñca-* array is formed
according to the nature of the ground and consists in arranging the
troops in rows resembling the rows of birds flying in the sky; it is
that order in which the neck is thin, the tail medium and the wings
thick. The *Śyena* -array is that in which the wings are large, the neck
and tail medium, and the mouth small. The *Makara* -array is that which
has four legs, long and thick mouth and two lips. The *Sūcī-* array has
a thin mouth and a hole at the back and resembles a rod.—The *Chakra-*
array has eight concentric circles facing all directions and one
passage. The *Sarvatobhadra* -array is the order having eight sides in
all directions. The *Ratha* -array has the aspect of a cart, and the
*Sarpa* -array, that of a snake.’

*Kāmandaka* (18.49).—‘When there would be danger in the rear, the
Chariot-array should be formed; when it would he in the flanks, then the
*Vajra* -array; and in all situations the *Sarvatobhadra* -array should
be formed, which frightens the enemy.’
