*Āpastamba* (2.26, 2, 3).—‘They say that a king who is slain in
attempting to recover the property of Brāhmaṇas performs a sacrifice
where his body takes the place of the sacrificial post and at which an
unlimited fee is given.—Hereby have been declared the rewards of other
heroes who fall fighting for a worthy cause.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.45).—‘Those who have been killed in protecting a cow, or a
Brāhmaṇa, or a king, or a friend, or their own property, or their own
wedded wife, or their own life, go to heaven.’

*Yājñavalkya*, (1.323).—(See under 87.)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.324).—‘Even when one’s own army is broken up, if one
does not turn back, each step that he takes is equal to a
Horse-Sacrifice.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 405).—‘For the sake of his people,
the king shall fight, and even give up his life; thereby he obtains the
reward of a Horse-Sacrifice. If a man, without turning back, is killed
in battle by his enemies, he obtains the regions of Indra, won by his
valour.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 406).—‘The Kṣatriya resides on the chest of the
Kṣatriya, and the Brāhmaṇa at his back; therefore he should always guard
his back in battle; or else he becomes a Brāhmaṇa-killer.’
