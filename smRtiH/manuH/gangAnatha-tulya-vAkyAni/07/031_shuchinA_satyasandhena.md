*Gautama* (11.4).—‘The king shall be pure, of subdued senses, surrounded
by companions possessing excellent qualities and by the means of
upholding his rule.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.310).—‘He shall appoint ministers who are intelligent,
hereditarily connected, firm and pure.’

*Kāmandaka* (2.37).—‘inflicting extraordinarily heavy punishments, the
king frightens his people; and inflicting light ones, he ceases to be
feared. That king deserves praise who deals out punishment proportionate
to the offence.’
