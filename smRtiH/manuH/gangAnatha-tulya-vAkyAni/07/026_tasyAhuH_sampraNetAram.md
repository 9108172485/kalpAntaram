*Kāmandaka* (1.49).—‘From a strict observance of scriptural injunctions
and interdictions, wealth is acquired; from wealth proceeds desire; and
the fruition of desires brings happiness. He who does not indulge in the
reasonable enjoyment of these three objects destroys these, and also his
own self.’

Do. (2.16).—‘By the right administration of justice the king should
protect himself and encourage the branches of knowledge. The science of
government benefits mankind directly and the king is its preserver.’

Do. (2.25).—‘Punishments dealt out proportionately to offences increase
the *Trivarga* of the king; disproportionate punishment excites anger
even in Renunciates.’

*Gautama* (11.2).—‘The king shall be pure in acts and speech.’

*Yājñavalkya*. (1.308-309).—‘The king shall be modest, endowed with
virility, of noble family, truthful in words, pure, non-procrastinating,
with keen memory, not. mean and not cruel; righteous, not addicted to
evil habits, intelligent, brave, conversant with secrets.’
