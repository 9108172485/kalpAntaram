*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, p. 248).—‘The king shall employ the six methods
of conquest, in accordance with his own capacity; with those equal, or
superior, to himself, he shall make alliance; against those inferior, he
shall wage war... If the superior king does not agree to an alliance, he
should have recourse to such methods as making presents to him, creating
dissension and discontent among the vassals and subjects of that king
and so forth.’
