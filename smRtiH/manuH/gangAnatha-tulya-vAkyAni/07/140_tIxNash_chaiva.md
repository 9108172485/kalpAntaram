*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 134).—‘Impartial to all creatures,
well-versed in what is lawful and what unlawful, he shall never do
things alone by himself,—thus alone can he protect the earth.’

*Śukranīti* (4.1.130).—‘The king should punish his own people, being
mild internally, but harsh externally; and should be severe in
punishment upon those who are by nature wicked.’

*Śukranīti* (4.1.191).—‘The king should be merciful and inflict
punishment with care.’
