*Mahābhārata* (12.87.18).—‘Taxes therefore shall be levied by the king
after proper investigation; he should not destroy his own as well as
other people’s roots by too much greed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘The king, who unlawfully adds to his
treasury out of the kingdom, speedily perishes along with his relations,
losing all his prosperity. The fire arising out of the heat produced by
harassing the people, is extinguished only after having burnt the king’s
prosperity, family and life.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 276).—‘The king who unlawfully
realises from the kingdom, taxes, fines, duties and shares of the land’s
produce, is a sinner.’
