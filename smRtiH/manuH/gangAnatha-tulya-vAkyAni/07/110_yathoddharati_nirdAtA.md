*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 253).—‘Having established his
sovereignty over the land, and having set up fortifications according to
law, he shall employ all his strength in the removing of dangerous
elements.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.334).—‘He shall protect the people from dangers arising
from back-biters, thieves, wicked persons, and desperate criminals, and
specially from *Kāyasthas*.’

*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 253).—‘In protecting his
kingdom king shall see to it that the people do not become impoverished.
If the king, through folly or carelessness, allows his kingdom to become
impoverished, he very soon falls off, not only from the kingdom, hut
also from life itself.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.338-339).—‘If the king increases the wealth by means of
illegal exactions from the kingdom, he quickly loses his prosperity and
becomes ruined.’

*Kātyāyana* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 254).—‘Protecting the people,
removing of dangerous elements and honouring the twice-born—for these
purposes has the king been created.’
