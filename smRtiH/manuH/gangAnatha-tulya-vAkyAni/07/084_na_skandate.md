*Vaśiṣṭha* (30.7).—‘The offering made through the mouth of a Brāhmaṇa,
which is neither spilt nor causes pain, nor assails him who makes it, is
far more excellent than the *Agnihotra*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.315),—‘What is offered into the Brāhmaṇa-fire is an
oblation that involves no spilling and no pain, and is not tainted by
expiations.’
