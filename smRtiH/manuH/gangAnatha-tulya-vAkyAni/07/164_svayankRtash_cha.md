*Kāmandaka* (10.16-19).—‘Hostilities are of five kinds—(1) produced by
rivalry, (2) caused by dispute about lands, (3) caused by women, (4)
caused by irresponsible spies, (5) caused by some transgression on the
part of one party... Men recognise only two kinds: Hereditary and that
caused by some transgression.’
