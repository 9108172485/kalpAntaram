*Matsya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 180).—‘The ambassador should
he one who is truthful, conversant with dialects, eloquent, capable of
endurance, sweet of speech, possesses knowledge of countries and their
divisions, as also of time and its divisions; he should be one who
acquaints himself with places and things and reports what he knows to
the king at the right time.’

*Garuḍa-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 180).—‘Intelligent,
thoughtful, capable of gauging.the minds of others, hard-hearted,
truthful,—such should be the ambassador of the king.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Lakṣaṇa, p. 226).—‘High-born, polite,
eloquent, clever, sweet of speech, truthful, of bright complexion,—these
seven qualities should mark out the ambassador.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Lakṣaṇa, p. 226).—(Same as the
Matsya-purāṇa above.)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 78).—‘After having completed the consultation, he
shall send out ambassadors. The ambassador should be endowed with all
the qualities of the minister, if the entire business is to be confided
to him; and if he is possessed of only three quarters of these
qualities, only a part of the business shall be confided to him; and if
he is possessed of only half of those qualities, then he shall only
carry orders (without knowledge of the secrets).’

*Kāmandaka* (12.1).—‘Having previously held the necessary counsel, the
wise king shall depute to the court of the monarch against whom he
intends to march, an ambassador, confident of his special abilities,—his
selection having been approved by the cabinet.’
