*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 286).—‘Punishment governs all
creatures; punishment alone protects them; punishment lies awake while
all are asleep; the wise regard punishment as Law itself.’

*Mahābhārata* (Do., p. 287).—‘It is punishment that protects Dharma, and
also property; it is punishment that protects pleasure; hence is
punishment called the *Triad*; by punishment is grain protected, as also
wealth.’
