*Viṣṇu* (3.40).—‘He shall set out on an expedition in the month of
*Caitra* or *Mārgaśīrṣa*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.347).—‘He shall go out on an expedition at a time when
the kingdom of the enemy happens to be full of crops.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 331).—‘The king shall go
out on an expedition during the month of *Caitra* or *Mārgaśīrṣa*.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 399).—‘The marching of the army has been
recommended during *Caitra* or *Mārgaśīrṣa*; as at that time the corns
are ripe and there is plenty of water, the weather also is neither too
cold nor too hot. Hence the march should he undertaken at that time; or
at any time when the enemy is found to he in difficulties.’

*Kāmandaka* (15.35).—‘The best season for the marching out of elephants
is when the sky is overspread with masses of rain-clouds; seasons other
than this are suitable for the marching of horses: and the proper season
for a military expedition is that which is neither too hot nor too cold,
nor rainy nor dry, and when the earth is covered with corn.’
