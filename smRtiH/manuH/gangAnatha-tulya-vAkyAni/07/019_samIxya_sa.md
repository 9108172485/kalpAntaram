*Yājñavalkya* (1.354-356).—‘When inflicted according to the law,
punishment renders happy the entire universe of gods, *asuras* and men;
otherwise it creates disturbance among them. Illegal punishment is
destructive of heaven, fame and popularity; legal punishment brings to
the king Heaven, fame and victory.’
