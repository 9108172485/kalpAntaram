*Yājñavalkya* (l.348, 349).—‘The success of an act is dependent upon
Fate and upon Human Effort; of these Fate is determined by previous
births, and Human Effort is apparent. Some acts succeed by chance, some
through human effort; human effort is at the root of them all.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 313).—‘Fate is one’s own
deeds committed in previous births, hence the wise have held Effort to
be superior to Fate; adverse Fate is set aside by Effort. Fate, Effort
and Time,—on these three together depends the success of man’s
operations.’

*Rāmāyaṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 314).—‘It is only the man who is
weak and devoid of virility that depends upon Fate; one who is strong
and virile never gives in to Fate. One who tries to suppress Fate by
Human Effort never suffers.’

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 315).—‘Fate consists of what the man has done himself
during his previous lives, and Human Effort is what he does during the
present life.’
