*Arthaśāstra* (p. 39).—‘He shall have recourse to only such pleasure as
is in consonance with spiritual and material welfare; he shall not
deprive himself of pleasure entirely; or he may devote equal attention
to all the three; as over-addiction to any one of them ruins the other,
etc. Material Welfare is the most important, says Kauṭilya; Spiritual
Welfare and Pleasure are dependent upon that.’
