*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 327).—‘When a king finds
himself stronger than another, he shall declare war on him. He shall
undertake the march when he finds that it would bring him much gain.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.347).—‘The king shall march against another kingdom
when it is full of crops, and the king thereof is weak, while the
attacking king himself has his men and conveyances fit.’
