*Gautama* (It. 3).—‘The king shall be fully instructed in the threefold
science and in Logic.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 310).—‘Fully instructed in Logic, in Political
Science, in Agricultural Science and in the Threefold Science (Vedas).’

*Arthasāstra* (pp. 34-35).—‘The discipline of the sciences is obtained
through the authority of the professors of each; for the sake of this
discipline one should always remain in constant touch with those learned
in the sciences.’

*Kāmandaka* (1.59,03,66).—‘Association with the Preceptor bestows
knowledge of the scriptures; knowledge of the scriptures increases
humility. A king who is modest under culture never sinks under
calamities. A king well-versed in polity, practising self-control, very
soon attains to that shining pitch of prosperity that has been attained
by other divine kings. The Preceptor is worshipped for the acquisition
of learning; learning which has been mastered becomes instrumental in
enhancing the prudence of the illustrious; and the habit of acting by
prudence leads to prosperity.’
