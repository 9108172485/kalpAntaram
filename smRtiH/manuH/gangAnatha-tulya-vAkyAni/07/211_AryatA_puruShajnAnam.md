*Yājñavalkya* (1.351).—‘Among all gains—those of gold, land and so
forth,—the gain of a friend is the best of all.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 277 ).—‘ There are three
kinds of friends—(1) hereditary, (2) the subsidiaries of the enemy, and
(3) artificial friend.’

*Arthaśāstra* (Part II, p. 292).—‘Among the three gains—of Friend, Gold
and Rand, the preceding is superior to the succeeding; Gold and Friend
superior to land, and Friend superior to Gold.’
