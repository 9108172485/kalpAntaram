*Pracetas* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti, p. 159).—‘Acquiring, spending,
directing, forbidding, proclaiming, investigating suits, punishing and
expiating,—are the eight functions of the king; by fulfilling these
eight functions the king goes to Heaven and is honoured by
Indra.—Assistants, means of accomplishment, division of place, division
of time, and remedy for troubles,—these are the five elements of
success.’

*Uśanas* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 411).—(Same as above.)

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 75).—‘The five subjects for consultation are—(1) the
means of commencing operations, (2) the supply of requisite men and
material, (3) adjustment of time and place, (4) the remedy of troubles,
and (5) success.’
