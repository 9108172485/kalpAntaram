*Kāmandaka* (1.20).—‘Humility is synonymous with thorough control over
the senses. One possessing it becomes learned in the Śāstras.’

*Arthaśāstra* (8.34).—‘Punishment brings about security of life and
property only when it is based upon discipline. Discipline is of two
kinds—artificial and natural. Learning disciplines only such a man as
has his intelligence duly cultivated through service, listening to
teachings, carrying them in memory, and knowledge of reasonings and
arguments.’

*Śukranīti* (1.101).—‘Discipline is the chief thing for the king; this
comes through the dictates of Śāstra; it gives mastery over the senses.’
