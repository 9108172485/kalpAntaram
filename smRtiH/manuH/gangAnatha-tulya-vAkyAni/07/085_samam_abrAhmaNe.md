**(verses 7.85-86)  
**

*Gautama* (5.20).—‘The reward of a gift to a non-Brāhmaṇa is equal to
the value of the gift; that of what is given to a Brāhmaṇa is twofold;
that of what is given to a Vedic scholar, thousandfold; and that of what
is given to one thoroughly versed in the Veda, endless.’

*Viṣṇu* (93.1-4).—‘What is given to a non-Brāhmaṇa produces the same
fruit in the world to come;—what is given to one who calls himself a
Brāhmaṇa produces twice the same fruit;—what is given to one who has
studied the main portions of the Veda produces a thousand times the same
fruits;—what is given to one who has mastered the whole Veda, produces
infinite fruit.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.201).—‘Cows, land, gold and other things are to be
offered, with respect, to proper recipients; a man desiring his own
welfare shall give nothing to an improper person.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 286).—‘The cow, the horse, the gold and the
land, on seeing the hands of a Brāhmaṇa ignorant of the Veda, decries
the giver.’
