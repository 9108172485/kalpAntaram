*Mahābhārata* (13.61.31).—‘A king in whose kingdom women are taken away
by force, while their husbands and sons are crying for help, is really
dead; he is not alive.’

*Āpastamba* (Vivādaratnākara, p. 294).—‘That king is said to he the
ordainer of security in whose kingdom there is no fear of thieves,
either in villages or in forests.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘If wicked robbers prosper in the kingdom of a king, the
sin being very much enhanced cuts off the very roots of that king.’
