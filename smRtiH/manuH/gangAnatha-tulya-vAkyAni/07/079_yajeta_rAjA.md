*Āpastamba* (2.26.1).—‘A king who, without detriment to his dependents,
gives land and money to Brāhmaṇas, according to their deserts, gains
imperishable worlds.’

*Viṣṇu* (3.78-81, 84).—‘He shall offer sacrifices;—he must not suffer
any Brāhmaṇa in his realm to perish from want, nor any other loading a
pious life. He shall bestow landed property upon Brāhmaṇas. He shall
present the Brāhmaṇas with gifts of every kind.’
