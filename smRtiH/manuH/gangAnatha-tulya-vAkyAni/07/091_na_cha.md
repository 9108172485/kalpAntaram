**(verses 7.91-93)  
**

*Gautama* (10.18).—‘No sin is incurred in slaying foes in
battle,—excepting those who have lost their horses, charioteers or arms,
those who join their hands in supplication, those who flee with flying
hair, those who sit. down with averted faces, those who have climbed in
flight on eminences or trees, messengers, and those who declare
themselves to be cows, or Brāhmaṇas.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.18.11).—‘He shall not light those in fear, intoxicated,
insane or out of their minds; nor those who have lost their armour; nor
with women, infants, aged men and Brāhmaṇas.’

*Āpastamba* (2.10, 11).—‘The Āryas forbid the killing of those who have
laid down their arms, of those who beg for mercy with flying hair or
joined palms, and of fugitives.’

*Yajñavalkya* (1.325).—‘He shall mot strike one who says *I am yours*,
or who is terrified, or deprived of arms, or who is engaged with another
person, or who has turned hack from the fight, or one who is only
looking on the battle.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Rājanīti., p. 407).—‘Who is eating straw, who is
engaged with another, who is not actively engaged in fight, who is
seeking shelter, the imbecile, one pressed by another, the religious
student, the aged man, the outcast, the infant,—these shall not ho
struck in lawful battle, by soldiers, even in times of distress.’
