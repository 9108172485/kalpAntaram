**(verses 4.60-61)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (63.2).—‘He shall not go on a journey, alone.’

Do. (72.64-68).—‘He shall not live in the kingdom of a Śūdra; nor in a
place crowded with unrighteous people; he shall not live in a place
where there is no physician; nor in a place frequented (by low castes);
he shall not dwell for long on a mountain.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (16-22).—‘The dwelling of the Brāhmaṇa should be
in a place where there is abundance of fuel and water, and where moving
about is dependent upon himself.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (32.18).—‘He shall not attend on Śūdras; nor
shall he dwell in places controlled by Śūdras.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.51).—‘The righteous man should try to live in a
village where there is abundance of fuel and water, of fodder,
sacrificial fuel, kuśa-grass and garlands, which is inhabited by wealthy
persons, where idle men do not abound, where cultured people abound, and
which cannot be entered by robbers.’
