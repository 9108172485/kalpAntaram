*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (l.9.9-11).—‘The Śūdra and the outcast are like

outcast (the reading shall be stopped).’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.33).—‘During the time that the Śūdra hears or sees
(study shall be stopped).’

Sāman.’

*Vyāsa* (Do.).—‘What is read on a forbidden day, or near a Śūdra, or for
obtaining gifts, leads one to hell.’
