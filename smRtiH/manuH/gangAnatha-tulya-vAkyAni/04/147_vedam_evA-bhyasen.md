*Yājñāvalkya* (1.40).—‘From among all sacrifices, austerities and other
meritorious acts, the Veda alone is what secures the highest good for
twice-born men.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya, Saṃskāra, p. 508).—‘Dharma is not known by any
other means, it grew out of the Veda alone; therefore for the purposes
of sacrifice, one should have recourse to the Veda only.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do., p. 511).—‘Without the Veda one cannot he a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Atri* (151).—‘There is no scripture superior to the Veda; there is no
elder superior to the mother; there is no friend superior to
charity,—either here or in the next world.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.14.12).—‘There is no refuge beyond the Veda.’
