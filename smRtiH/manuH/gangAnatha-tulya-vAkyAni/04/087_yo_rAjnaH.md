*Skandapurāṇa* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 199).—‘The man who has
been brought up on gifts from the king becomes a Brahmarākṣasa in the
water-less desert, and docs not obtain another birth. The man who,
having renounced his Brāhmaṇahood, and deluded by greed for riches and
for sensual objects, accepts gifts from the king, his fall into the
Raurava hell is certain. Even trees burnt by forest-fíres grow again on
the advent of rain; but those that have been burnt by gifts from the
king never grow again.’
