*Dakṣa* (2.4-6).—‘What is to be done during the first part of the day is
now prescribed,—as also that to be done during the second, third,
fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts of the day, generally: at
dawn, one shall perform the evacuations, and then bath, preceded by the
cleansing of the teeth.’

*Dakṣa* (30.31.33).—‘After that he shall perform his duty towards the
gods, and then the seeing of the teacher and the auspicious things; the
forenoon is the time prescribed for the duty to the gods; the duties to
the gods should be performed during the forenoon; and those to the men,
during midday; those to the pitṛs, in the afternoon...... If what has
been laid down as to be done in the forenoon is done in the evening, it
becomes absolutely futile.’

*Kālaviveka* (p. 367).—‘Duties to the gods should be performed during
the forenoon, those to the Pitṛs, in the afternoon; but the unitary
Śrāddha should be performed at midday, and the auspicious Śrāddha in the
morning.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 61.2).—‘Fully equipped with auspicious rites,
duly purified and with due care, he shall perform the duty towards gods
in the forenoon, and that towards Pitṛs in the afternoon.’

Do. (Do., 161.25).—(Same as Manu.)
