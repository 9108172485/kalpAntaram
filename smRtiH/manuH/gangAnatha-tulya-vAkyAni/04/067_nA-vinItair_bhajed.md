*Viṣṇu* (3.13-17).—‘He shall not be carried by such beasts as are
constantly suffering from their tails or some disease;—nor by such as
are deficient in their limbs, nor by such as are poorly, nor by
bullocks, nor by such as are not trained.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 174).—‘One should not ride on wicked or
defective conveyances.’
