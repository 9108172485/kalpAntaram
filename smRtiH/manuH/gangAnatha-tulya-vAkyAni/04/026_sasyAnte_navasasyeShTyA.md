*Viṣṇu* (59.5-9).—‘At each solstice, with the Paśuyāga;—during the
autumn and the summer, with the Āgrayaṇa sacrifice;—also on the ripening
of the Vrīhi and the Yava;—he who possesses grains more than what would
be needed for three years,—each year, with Soma-sacrifice.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.41).—‘The Brāhmaṇa must necessarily lay the Fires;—he
shall perform the sacrifices of Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa, Āgrayaṇeṣṭi,
Cāturmāsya, Paśu and Soma.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.126).—‘Each year, the Soma,—at each solstice the
Paśu,—and the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi and the Cāturmāsya also shall be performed.’
