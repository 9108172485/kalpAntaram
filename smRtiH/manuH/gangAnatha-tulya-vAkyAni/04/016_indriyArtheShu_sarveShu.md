*Gautama* (9.50).—‘He shall not give much scope to the sexual organs,
the stomach, the hand, the feet, the speech and the eye.’

*Āpastamba* (2.5).—‘By controlling the activities of the mind, the
speech, the breath, the eye, the ear, the tactile organ, the sexual
organ,—he attains immortality.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.1).—‘Always using water, always wearing the sacred
thread, daily studying the Veda, avoiding the Śūdra’s food, approaching
his wife only during the *season*, offering oblations according to
rule,—the Brāhmaṇa falls not from the region of Brahman.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.122).—‘......Control of the senses......these are
conducive to the accomplishment of Dharma, for all men.’
