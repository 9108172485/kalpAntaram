*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.3, 6).—‘The miser, the initiated, the imprisoned, the
diseased, the Soma-seller, the carpenter, the dyer, the wine-seller, the
spy, the usurer, the dealer in leather, the Śūdra, the weapon-wielder,
the paramour, the person who permits a paramour, who burns houses, he
who kills for the sake of other people eating the meat. The gods eat not
the food of the dog-keeper, nor of the man who has a Śūdra wife, nor of
the man controlled by his wife, nor of one who permits a paramour in the
house.’

apostate and those who have neglected their vows.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.16-16).—‘One who makes a living by dogs, the wine-seller,
the oilsman, the clothes-washer, the woman in her courses, and of the
man who has a paramour in the house of his wife.’
