*Viṣṇu* (71.2).—‘He shall not laugh at persons who have redundant limbs,
or who are deficient in limbs, or who are illiterate, or who are devoid
of wealth.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, p. 161.36).—\[Reproduces Manu but reading
‘*satya*’ for ‘*jāti*.’\]

*Yājñavalkya* (1.153).—‘One should not touch the sensitive part of any
person.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 174).—‘One should avoid such ironical words as
calling the blind *one with excellent eyes*, the Caṇḍāla a *Brāhmaṇa*;
nor should one call the Śūdra a *Śūdra* or the outcast an *outcast*;
such words, though truthful are twice as bad as untruthful words.’
