*Gautama* (9.4-7).—‘He shall not wear cloth that is loudly coloured, or
that has been worn by another; nor garlands or shoes; in the event of
incapacity, he may wear washed clothes; he should never grow his beard,
without cause.’

*Gautama* (69).—‘He shall teach those that are disciplined,—himself
disciplined in cleanliness, and ever alert in regard to the Veda.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.131).—‘Wearing white clothes, with hair, beard and
nails clipped,—he shall not eat in the presence of his wife, nor with
only one cloth, nor standing.’

*Āpastamba* (1.30.10-12).—‘In his clothing, he shall avoid all
colouring; also what is naturally black. He shall wear only such cloth
as may not be obtrusive.’
