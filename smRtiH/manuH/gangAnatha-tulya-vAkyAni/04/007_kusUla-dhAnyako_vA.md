**(verses 4.7-8)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.228).—‘He may be the possessor of a granary-full or a
jar-full of grains, or of grain enough for three days, or of grain not
enough for the morrow; or he may live by gleaning and picking; the
succeeding being superior to the preceding among these.’

*Laghu-Viṣṇu* (2.16-17).—‘The virtuous householders are divided into
four classes according to the difference in their means of livelihood;
of these the following is superior to the preceding. \[Three quarters of
Manu’s text being reproduced, the fourth part is read as
*sadyaḥprakṣālakaḥ*, one who had just enough for the last meal that he
has had.\]’

*Mahābhārata* (12.249.2-3).—‘Four kinds of livelihood for householders
have been described by the wise—the first is the possessing of a
granary-full of grains; then the possessing of a jar-full of grains;
then the possessing of not enough for the morrow; and the last is the
method of the pigeon (having nothing beyond the present meal); among
these the following is superior to the preceding.’
