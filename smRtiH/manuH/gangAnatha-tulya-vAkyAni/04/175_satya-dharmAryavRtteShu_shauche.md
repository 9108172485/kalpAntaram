*Gautama* (1, 50.68, 69, 70).—‘He shall never be fickle with the
generative organ, the stomach, the hands, the feet, speech and eyes. He
shall be devoted to Truthfulness and Rightful Conduct. He shall be the
instructor of well-disciplined pupils; practised in cleanliness, and
devoted to the Veda;—ever harmless, mild, firmly active, self-controlled
and charitable.’
