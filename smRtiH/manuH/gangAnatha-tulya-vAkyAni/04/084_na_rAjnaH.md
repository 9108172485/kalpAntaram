**(verses 4.84-85)**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.141).—\[‘He shall not accept any gifts from a king who
is greedy and who acts against the scriptures.’\]

‘In the matter of acceptance of gifts, the butcher, the oil-presser, the
wine-vendor, the prostitute and the king are all condemned, each
succeeding one being ten times worse than the preceding.’

*Yama* (4, 58).—‘Gifts from the king should be avoided by those who are
desirous of winning the three worlds; by accepting the gift of a king,
one’s Brāhmaṇahood disappears.’

*Saṃvarta* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 199).—‘The king’s gift is
something terrible; it is like wine-drinking, and like poison; it is
better to feed on the flesh of one’s own son, than to accept of the
king’s gift.’
