*Mahābhārata* (Śānti, 138.192.191).—‘O Friend, wise men do not, without
reason, place themselves under the influence of their enemies...... He
shall not trust the untrust worthy, even the trustworthy he shall not
trust over-much; he should always make others trust him, but he himself
shall not trust others.’

Do. (139.75).—‘Having done harm to a certain person, he shall not trust
him......... By reposing trust upon a person after having injured him,
one always falls into trouble.’
