**(verses 4.167-168)  
**

*Gautama* (21.22).—‘On fetching blood, for as many years as there may be
dust-particles wetted with the blood (he shall be unfit for heaven).’

*Baudhāyana* (1.1.6.8).—‘Having struck the Brāhmaṇa unintentionally, one
becomes defiled under the law; for this unintentional striking, the
sages have prescribed expiations; there is no expiation for intentional
striking. On threatening the Brāhmaṇa, one should perform the *Kṛcchra*;
on striking him, the *A* *tikṛcchra*; on spilling his blood, the
*Kṛccra* as well as the *Cāndrāyaṇa*.’
