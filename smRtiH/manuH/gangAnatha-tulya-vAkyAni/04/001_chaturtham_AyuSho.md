*Mahābhārata* (12.242.28-30).—‘The pupil shall pass through the
life-stages, free from vulgarity; having gone through the fourth part of
his life by keeping the fasts and observances, relating to the Veda, he
shall offer the fee to his preceptor and perform the ceremony of
‘Return’ according to the law; being united to a virtuous wife and
having, with due care, kindled the fires, the householder shall pass the
second quarter of his life, keeping firm in his observances.’

Do. (12.243.1).—‘During the second quarter of his life, the householder
shall live in the house, firm in his observances, after having been
united to a virtuous wife and having kindled the fires.’
