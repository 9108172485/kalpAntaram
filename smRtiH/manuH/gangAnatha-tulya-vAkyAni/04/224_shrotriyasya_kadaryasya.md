*Baudhāyana* (1.5.63).—‘Having compared the food offered by a man pure
but devoid of faith, and that by one impure, but endowed with faith,—the
gods declared them to he equal. Prajāpati told them that the two were
not equal, hut unequal; what is offered by the faithless being damned,
that which is purified by faith is distinctly superior.’

*Mahābhārata* (Śānti., 270.10).—‘People learned in the ancient lore
recite certain verses sung by Brāhmaṇas:—In connection with the
sacrificial performance the gods regarded as similar the food offered by
the pure hut faithless man and that offered by the impure but faithful;
similarly also that offered by the miserly Vedic scholar and by the
generous woman,—having compared these two, they regarded them as equal.
Prajāpati however told them that they had committed a mistake; that
offered by the generous is purified by faith, while the other is damned
through want of faith.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.14).—‘One should eat the food offered even by the thief,
if he is endowed with faith; but never of that man who sacrifices for,
or initiates, many people.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 508).—‘Even food offered by one’s
teacher should not be eaten, if it is not offered with respect.’
