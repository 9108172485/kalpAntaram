*Laghuśātātapa* (78, 83).—‘If, in the matter of feeding and gifts, one
ignores a Brāhmaṇa Student who may happen to be at hand, he destroys his
family up to the seventh generation. If a Vedic Scholar, accomplished in
the Veda, in learning and in observances, come to one’s house, all the
vegetables become delighted at the prospect of reaching the highest
state.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (42, 43).—‘The man who is free from jealousies, who is of
good character, a Vedic Scholar cognisant of Brahman, young and endowed
with learning and modesty is the proper recipient, the best of the
twice-born. He who is conversant with the Vedanta, who is Jyeṣṭhasāman,
free from avarice, devoted to the Veda, is the person who should be
employed with special effort in the rites offered to gods and Pitṛs.’
