*Gautama* (23.23.24).—‘If one eats food of the man whose food should not
be eaten, he should reduce himself to a condition when there is nothing
in his bowels;—he should not eat anything for three days.’

*Prajāpati*—‘On eating the food of one whose food should not be eaten
one should give to the Brāhmaṇa the price of that food; he should remain
with wet clothes throughout the day, or he should give a cow.’
