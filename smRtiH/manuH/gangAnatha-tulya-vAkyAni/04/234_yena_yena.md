**(verses 4.234-239)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 17.3.5.6).—‘Neither father, nor mother, nor
brother, nor son, nor teacher, nor relations, parental or marital, nor
friends are any help to man;...therefore with lawfully acquired riches,
the wise man should serve Righteousness; Righteousness is the only
helper for men as regards the other world.’

*Āpastamba* (1.7.22.23).—‘Having made a gift, one should not advertise
it;—having done an act, one should not think of it again.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 291).—‘If one gives wealth with great respect, to
qualified men, he obtains great wealth and sons and grandsons.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.156).—‘With act, mind and speech one should try his
best to do his duty.’
