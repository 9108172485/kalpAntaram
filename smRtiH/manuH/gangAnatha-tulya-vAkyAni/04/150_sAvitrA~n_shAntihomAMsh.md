*Viṣṇu* (71.86).—‘On the Parva days one shall offer the propitiatory
oblations.’

*Viṣṇu* (76.1-2).—‘The moonless day, the three Aṣṭakās, the three
Anvaṣṭakās, the full moon day of Māgha, the thirteenth day after the
full moon day of Bhādra, and also the ripening of the Vrīhi and the
Yava;—these are the compulsory occasions for Śrāddha—says Prajāpati. If
one does not offer Śrāddha on these occasions, he falls into hell.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.217).—‘The moonless day, the Aṣṭakās, the Vṛddhi, the
darker fortnight, the two solstices, materials, excellent Brāhmaṇas, and
the Viṣuvat Saṅkrānti.’

*Prajāpati* (30).—‘On all the Aṣṭakās, and all the Anvaṣṭakās, one
should offer balls of food, which is conducive to endless satisfaction.’
