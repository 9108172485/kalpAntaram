*Yājñavalkya* (1.124).—‘That Brāhmaṇa who may have grains enough for
three years shall drink *Soma*; and he who has enough for the year shall
perform the rites previous to the Soma.’

*Viṣṇu* (59. 2-4).—‘The Agnihotra in the morning and in the
evening;—oblations should be poured to the gods;—one shall offer
sacrifices on the moonless and full-moon days, by reason of the
proximity and remoteness of the moon and the sun.’
