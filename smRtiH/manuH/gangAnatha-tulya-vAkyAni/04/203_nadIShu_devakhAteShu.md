*Viṣṇu* (64.16).—‘He shall bathe in springs, in ponds dug by the gods
and in lakes.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.159).—‘He shall bathe in rivers, in ponds dug by the
gods and in springs.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya* (Aparārka, p. 235).—‘Than water pulled out of the well, the
water on the ground is more sacred; and more so is the water of a
waterfall; better than that is lake-water; purer than that is
river-water; purer than that is the water of a Tīrtha; and the water of
the Gaṅgā is the most sacred of all.’

*Yājñavalkya* (Do.).—‘When a larger water is available one shall not
bathe in the smaller one; nor in an artificial one, where there is a
river.’
