**(verses 4.5-6)  
**

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (1.2.25.23).—‘He may live either by *Nectar* or by *Death;
Nectar* is that which is obtained unasked, and *Death* is the alms
obtained by begging.’

*Bṛhad-Yama* (60, 62).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is ruined by serving the king.
Those Brāhmaṇas who serve such masters as should not be served, and who
officiate at sacrifices for those for whom it should not be done, are to
be regarded as *impure* and beyond the pale of all Dharma.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2.27).—‘When unable to maintain himself by means of his own
occupations, he shall never have recourse to a sinful occupation.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.25).—‘In abnormal times of distress, the Brāhmaṇa may
maintain himself by the occupation of the Kṣatriya, or by that of the
Vaiśya.’

*Viṣṇu* (2.15).—‘In times of distress, the occupation of the next
(caste).’

*Baudhāyana* (2.2.69, 72).—‘Being unable to maintain himself by
teaching, officiating at sacrifices, and receiving of gifts, he shall
live by the occupation of the Kṣatriya; this being the next best for
him;—he may also have recourse to the occupation of the Vaiśya; this
being the next best.’

*Gautama* (7.6-7).—‘In the absence of the aforesaid, the occupation of
the Kṣatriya; in the absence of this latter also, the occupation of the
Vaiśya.’
