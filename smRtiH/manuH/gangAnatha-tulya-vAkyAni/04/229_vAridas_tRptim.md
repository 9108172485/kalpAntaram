*Vaśiṣṭha* (29.8).—‘One who gives water prospers in all his desires;—he
who gives food obtains good eyes.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 92.20, 22).—‘By the giving of water eternal
fame ensues, by the giving of food, one has all his desires for
enjoyment fulfilled;—by the giving of lamp-light, the man obtains good
eyes and keen intelligence.’

*Viṣṇu* (91.3, 15, 16).—‘The giver of water remains ever satisfied;—by
the giving of lamps, he obtains excellent eyes and universal brilliance;
by the giving of food, he becomes endowed with strength.’

*Viṣṇu* (92.21, 23).—‘The giver of food obtains all things;—the giver of
sesamum obtains desirable offspring.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1, 210).—‘By giving away, land, sesamum, food, clothes,
water, clarified butter, shelter, household-necessaries, gold and beasts
of burden,—one shines in the heavenly regions.’

*Bṛhaspati* (13).—‘The giver of food is always happy, the giver of
clothes becomes endowed with beauty, and the man who gives land is
always a king.’
