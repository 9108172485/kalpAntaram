*Gautama* (16.48-49).—‘For those partaking in the Śrāddha till the same
time next day; also when there is some connection with Śrāddha performed
with uncooked food.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.7).—‘Fruits, water, sesamum, foods and other things
connected with the Śrāddha,—on the acceptance of all this, it becomes
unfit for study, the Brāhmaṇas having been declared to have their hands
for their mouth.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.26-30).—‘By accepting gifts and eating at the
Śrāddha, the rest of the day becomes unfit for study;—after eating, till
digestion; the Brāhmaṇa has his hands for his mouth. In this connection
they cite the following:—There is no difference between what is eaten
and what is received in gift.’
