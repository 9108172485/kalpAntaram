*Gautama* (9.71).—‘The Accomplished Student who maintains this behaviour
saves from sin his parents and relations both above and below himself,
and fails not in attaining the regions of Brahman.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.17).—‘Ever bathing, ever wearing the sacred thread, ever
studying the Veda, avoiding the food of outcasts, approaching his wife
only during the periods, and offering oblations according to law, the
Brāhmaṇa fails not to reach the regions of Brahman.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.24).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who every day, during the day and
the night and the twilights offers prayers, becomes purified by Brahman
and becomes Brahman Itself; and following the scriptures, he wins the
regions of Brahman.’



*End of Adhyāya IV*.
