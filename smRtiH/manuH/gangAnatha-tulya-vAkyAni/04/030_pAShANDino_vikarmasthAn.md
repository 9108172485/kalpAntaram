*Yājñavalkya* (1.130).—‘One should always exclude the hypocrite, the
logician, the impostor and those who behave like the heron.’

*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Aparārka, p. 171).—‘The man who transgresses all
laws laid down in the Śruti and the Smṛti, relating to the division of
castes and life-stages, and acts as he likes, relying upon false
reasonings, addicted to evil deeds, deluded with overweening opinion of
his own reasoning powers, is the Pāṣaṇḍin, wicked, fit for hell, the
lowest of men. With such men and with the Vaiḍālavratas one shall never
have any intercourse.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Do.).—\[Same as Manu.\]
