*Gautama* (9.51).—‘Cutting, breaking, scratching, rubbing and
clapping—these he shall not do without some purpose.’

*Āpastamba* (1.32.28).—‘Grass-chopping, clod-crushing, spitting—these,
without necessity (should be avoided).’

*Viṣṇu* (71.42-43).—‘He shall not be a clod-crusher; nor a
grass-chopper.’

*Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana, 104.15).—‘He who crushes clods of earth or
chops grass or eats his nails, is ever unclean and never attains long
life.’
