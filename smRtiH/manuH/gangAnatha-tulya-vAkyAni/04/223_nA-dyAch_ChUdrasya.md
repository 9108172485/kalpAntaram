*Parāśara* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 492).—‘The food remains ‘Śūdra’s
food’ only so long as as it has not been touched by the twice-born; as
soon as it has been touched by the twice-born’s hand, it becomes sacred
food.’

*Yama* (Do.).—‘Śūdra’s food when placed in a vessel belonging to the
twice-born is not objectionable.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Do.).—‘When Śūdra’s food comes to one’s house, it should
be eaten after water has been sprinkled over it.’

*Āpastamba* (1.18, 3 *et. seq*.).—‘ He may accept uncooked food; or even
cooked food, such as is devoid of relish; he should desist after getting
just what would keep him alive.’

*Aṅgiras* (68-73).—‘He who eats the Śūdra’s food continuously for a
mouth, even during that same life, becomes a Śūdra, and after death, is
born a dog. There is no rise upwards for one who reads, sacrifices or
offers oblations while nourished by food given by the Śūdra. If a man
has recourse to his wife after eating of the food given by a Śūdra, the
son begotten by him belongs to that Śūdra. If a man dies with Śūdra’s
food in his stomach, he is born as a hog, or is born in the family of
that same Śūdra.’

*Gautama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 489).—‘Food may be begged from all
castes, with, the exception of such persons as are accused or outcast.’

*Hārita* (Do., p. 490).—‘One who dies with Śūdra’s food in his stomach
is born as a mule or a camel, and becomes a Śūdra.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Do.).—‘The twice-born man dying with Śūdra’s food in his
stomach becomes a hog, etc., etc.’

*Yama* (Do., p. 491).—‘The Agnihotrin who does not desist from Śūdra’s
food loses his soul, his Veda and his three Fires.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘The householder who eats Śūdra’s food loses his
strength and vigour.’
