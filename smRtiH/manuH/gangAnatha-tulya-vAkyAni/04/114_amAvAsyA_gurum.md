*Bodhāyana* (1.11.40).—‘Here they cite the following,—“The eighth of the
month destroys the Teacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the
fifteenth destroys the science; hence one should avoid reading at these
junctures.”’

*Viṣṇu* (30.29.30).—‘What is read on the day unit for study brings no
reward either in this world or in the other; by study on those days, I
here is diminution of the life-span of the teacher and also of the
pupil.’
