*Gautama* (16.11, 12, 18, 34, 46).—‘On evacuating the bladder and the
bowels;—at midnight, during the twilights and in water;—in the
cremation-ground, in the outskirts of the village, on the public
thorough fare and during impurities.—One day and night is to be regarded
as unfit for study on the completion of the Veda, or vomitting, or
eating at Śrāddha and at sacrifices to men. According to some people, in
the city it is always unfit for study.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.26, 30).—‘On accepting a gift in honour of the Piṭrs,
and on eating at Śrāddha, the rest of the day is unfit for study. At
birth and at death, there is to be no study, oven in the mind.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.10.26).—‘After dining at night.’

*Āpastamba* (11.17, 25, 26).—‘While immersed in water;—when there is
lightning, when it is thundering, or after eating at Śrāddha, during a
fog, they forbid even mental study.’

*Do*. (32.12).—‘During the night, there is to be no teaching except
moral teaching to the pupils.’

*Viṣṇu* (30.16).—‘Not in water.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.149).—‘In an unclean place, or when one is unclean,
during lightning and thunder, after eating while the hands are still
wet, in water, at midnight, or when very high winds are blowing.’

*Pāraskara* (2.11.2, 4).—‘On eating at Śrāddha, on the falling of
meteors, on earthquake, at fiery portents, at the junction of two
seasons,—there should be no study till the next day; after meals while
the hands are wet, in water, or midnight, during the two twilights,
while a dead body is lying in the village, and while a Caṇḍāla is in the
village.’
