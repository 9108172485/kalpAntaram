*Vaśiṣṭha* (29.20).—‘Three gifts they have described as *extreme
gifts*—*viz*., of cows, land and Veda; the gift of gold is the very
first of gifts; and superior even to that is the gift of learning.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.212).—‘Brahman (Veda) being the embodiment of all
Dharma, its gift is superior to all gifts; he who makes a gift of it
obtains the imperishable region of Brahman.’

*Bṛhaspati* (19).—‘Three gifts they have described as *extreme
gifts*;—*viz*., of cows, land and Veda; these three bring about the
salvation of the giver through recitation, sowing and milking.’
