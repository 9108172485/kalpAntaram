*Gautama* (16.17, 34).—‘When he is frightened, or riding a conveyance,
or lying down, or when his feet are thrust forward. It is unlit for
study during the rest of the day and night, on the completing of the
Veda, on vomitting, on eating at Śrāddha or at sacrifices to men.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.8).—‘While one is running, when there is rotting smell
and other such things spreading, seated on a tree, on the boat, in the
army, after meals while the hands are still wet, while the flute is
being played, on the fourteenth day, on the moonless day, on the Aṣṭakā
days, while he is thrusting forward his feet, before the cloth worn
during sexual intercourse has been washed, in ṭhe outskirts of the
village, when one has vomitted or passed urine or evacuated the bowels,
while there are sounds of the reciting of the Ṛk, Yajuṣ and Sāman, until
the food has become digested, while there is thunder, earthquake, solar
or lunar eclipse, when there is rumbling in the quarters or in the
mountains, or shaking of the mountains, when there is rain of flesh or
blood or dust, it is to be unfit for study till the same time next day.’

*Viṣṇu* (30.17).—‘Nor with his feet placed on a seat.’
