*Baudhāyana* (2.3.5-6).—‘People should not perform their bath in water
that has been dammed; a part of the merit goes to the man that built the
dam. For this reason one should avoid the dams and wells built by
others.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.159).—‘He shall not bathe in the tanks of other persons
until he has taken out five clods of earth; he shall bathe in a river or
in ponds dug by the gods, in lakes, and in springs.’

*Viṣṇu* (63.1).—‘He shall not perform his bath in tanks belonging to
others.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 169).—‘One shall avoid the dams
and wells built by others; the builder becomes a partaker in the merit:
one should bathe there after throwing in three handfuls of earth (and
three jarfuls of water).’
