**(verses 10.101-108)  
**

*Gautama* (7.4).—‘In times of distress, it is permissible to offer
sacrifices for men of all castes, to teach them and to accept gifts from
them.’

*Āpastamba* (?.18.5-7, 14-15),—‘In times of distress, if he is unable to
keep himself, he may eat food obtained from anybody, after having
touched it with gold, or with fire....... In times of distress, even the
food of a Śūdra, who lives under one’s protection for the sake of
spiritual merit, may be eaten. He may eat it, touching it once with gold
or with fire.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.9).—‘Through sacrificing for wicked people, through
teaching them, through intermarrying with them, or through accepting
their gifts, learned Brāhmaṇas do not contract guilt; for a learned
Brāhmaṇa resembles fire and the sun.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.41).—‘Agriculture, arts, service, learning,
money-lending, cart, hill, attendance, land covered with wood and water,
king, alms-begging,—these are the means of livelihood in times of
distress.’
