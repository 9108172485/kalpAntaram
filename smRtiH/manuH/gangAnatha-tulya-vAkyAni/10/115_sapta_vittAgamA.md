*Gautama* (10.39-42).—‘A man becomes an *owner* by inheritance,
purchase, partition, seizure or finding; acceptance of gift is an
additional mode of acquisition for the Brāhmaṇa; conquest for the
Kṣatriya; and gain by labour for the Vaiśya and the Śūdra.’

*Arthaśāstra* (II. p. 97).—‘In places where conditions are unsettled,
undisturbed possession is the basis for ownership.’
