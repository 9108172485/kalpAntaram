*Gautama* (7.16-23).—‘But it is permissible to barter one kind of
substances used for flavouring for others, and animals. Salt and
prepared food must not be bartered, nor sesamum. But for present use, an
equal quantity of uncooked food may be exchanged for cooked food.—But if
no other course is possible, a Brāhmaṇa may support himself in any way
except by following the occupations of a Śūdra. Some people permit even
this in case his life is in danger.’

*Āpastamba* (1.20.14-16—1.21.1-4).—‘The exchange of one of these
(above-mentioned goods) for the other is likewise unlawful. But food may
be exchanged for food, and slaves for slaves, and condiments for
condiments, and perfumes for perfumes and learning for learning. Let him
traffic with lawful merchandise which he has not bought, with *Muñja*
grass, *Balvaja* -g rass, roots and fruits; and with grass and wood
which have not been worked up. He shall not be too eager for such
livelihood. If he obtains another livelihood, he shall leave off
trading.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2.37-39).—‘Substances used for flavouring may be bartered
for other substances of the same kind, be it for one more valuable or
for one worth less. But salt must never be exchanged for other
substances used for flavouring. It is permitted to barter sesamum, rice,
cooked food, learning, and slaves.’
