*Gautama* (10.56).—‘Serving the higher castes (is the duty of the
Śūdra).’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.120).—‘Attending on the twice-born is the occupation
for the Śūdra; not gaining a living by that means, he shall become a
trader, or live by means of the various arts, always working for the
welfare of the twice-born.’
