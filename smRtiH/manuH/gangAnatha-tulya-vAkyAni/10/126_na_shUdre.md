**(verses 10.126-127)**

*Gautama* (10.64-65).—‘If permission has been given to him, the Śūdra
may use the syllable *namaḥ* as his *mantra*. Some people declare that
he may himself offer the *Pākayajñas*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.121).—‘Devoted to his wife, pure, supporting his
dependants, devoted to the performance of *śrāddha*, he should not omit
to perform the fire sacrifices with the syllable *namaḥ* as his
*mantra*.’
