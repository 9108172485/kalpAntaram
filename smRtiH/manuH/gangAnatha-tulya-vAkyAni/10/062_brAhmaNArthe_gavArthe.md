*Mahābhārata* (13.48.34-35).—‘Rendering help to cows and Brāhmaṇas, and
practising sympathy, mercy, truthfulness, forgiveness and protecting
others even by one’s own body,—these are the means of success for
outcasts.’

*Viṣṇu* (16.18).—‘Giving up life, regardless of any reward, in order to
save a Brāhmaṇa, or a cow, or for the sake of a woman or a child,—may
confer heavenly bliss even upon members of the base castes.’
