*Vaśiṣṭha* (12.37).—‘They quote a verse proclaimed by Manu referring to
duties and taxes—“No duty is paid on a sum less than a *Kārṣāpaṇa*;
there is no tax on livelihood gained by art; nor on an infant, nor on a
messenger, nor on what has been received as alms, nor on the remnants of
property left after robbery, nor on a *Śrotriya*, nor on an ascetic, nor
on a sacrifice.”’
