*Vaśiṣṭha* (12.2-3).—‘The Accomplished Student shall not beg from any
body except from the King and a pupil. But he may ask from any body, if
pressed by hunger, for some small gift, such as cultivated or
uncultivated field, a cow, a goat or a sheep or, at the last extremity,
for gold, grain or food.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.42),—‘When he has remained hungry for three days, he
may take grains from a non-Brāhmaṇa, and if accused of it, he should
rightly state the truth.’
