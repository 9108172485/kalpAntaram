*Vaśiṣṭha* (2.40-44).—‘A Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya shall lend money like
usurers. They quote the following—“He who, acquiring property cheap,
gives it for a high price, is called a *usurer* and blamed among those
who recite the Veda. Brahmā weighed in the scales the crime of killing a
learned Brāhmaṇa against the crime of usury and the slayer of the
Brāhmaṇa went upwards.”—They may lend gold, at pleasure, to a person who
entirely neglects his sacred duties and is exceedingly wicked,—taking
double its value on repayment,—and grain, trebling the original price.’
