*Mahabharata* (13.33.21-22; 13.35.17-18).—‘Śākas, Yavanas, Kāmbojas and
other Kṣatriya castes became degraded by not seeing the Brāhmaṇas.
Drāviḍas, Kaliṅgas, Pulindas, Uśīnaras, Kolisarpas and Māhiṣakas and
other Kṣatriya castes became degraded by not seeing the Brāhmaṇas.
Kirātas, Yavanas and other Kṣatriya castes became degraded because they
would not bear with the Brāhmaṇas.’

*Śukranīti* (4.4.74).—‘The *Yavanas* have all the four castes mixed
together; they recognise authority other than the Vedas and live in the
North and West. Their Śāstras have been framed for their welfare by
their own teachers.’
