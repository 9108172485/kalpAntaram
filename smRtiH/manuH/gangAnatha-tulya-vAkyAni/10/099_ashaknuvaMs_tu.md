*Gautama* (10.57, 60).—‘From the higher castes, he shall seek to obtain
his livelihood; and he may live by the mechanical arts.’

*Viṣṇu* (2.14).—‘For the Śūdra, all branches of art.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.120).—‘For the Śūdra, attending upon the twice-born has
been ordained; being unable to maintain himself by that, he shall become
a trader; or he shall live by the various arts, always doing what is
good for the twice-born.’
