*Gautama* (14.14).—‘The rules regarding impurity caused by death of a
relation are applicable to that caused by the birth of a child also;—in
this case, the impurity falls on the parents,—or on the mother alone.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.1).—‘Referring to births and deaths, they declare
that the impurity of Sapiṇḍas lasts ten days.’

Do. (1.11. 19-23).—‘On a birth indeed, the parents become impure for ten
days; some declare that the mother alone becomes impure, because people
avoid only lying-inwomen; others say that the father alone becomes
impure, because the semen is the chief cause, the Veda speaking of sons
born without mothers. Hut the correct opinion is that both the parents
become impure, because they are equally connected with the event.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.20-22).—‘The rule regarding impurity should bo exactly the
same on the birth of a child, for those men who desire complete
purity,—or for the mother and the father alone; according to some for
the mother only; they quote the following text:—“On the birth of a
child, the male does not become impure, if he does not touch the
female.”’

*Parāśara* (3.31).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.10).—‘The impurity (on birth) attaches to the parents;
but most certainly and completely to the mother. On the day of the birth
however there is no impurity; since on that day the ancestors are born.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 896).—There is no impurity for the male, if he
has no contact with the female.’
