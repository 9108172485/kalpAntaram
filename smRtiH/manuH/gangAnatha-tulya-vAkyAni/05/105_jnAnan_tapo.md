*Viṣṇu* (22.88).—(Same as Manu.)

*Baudhāyana* (1.5.52).—‘Time, fire, purity of mind, water and the like,
smearing with cow-dung, and ignorance (of defilement) are declared to be
the sixfold means of purification for created beings.’

*Yājñavalkya* (l.194).—‘Roads are purified by the rays of the moon and
the sun and by the wind.’

Do. (3.30-33).—‘Time, fire, acts, clay, wind, mind, knowledge,
austerity, water, repentance, fasting—all these are causes of
purification. For those who do what should not he done, charity is the
means of purification; the river is purified by its current; of things
requiring purification, it is brought about by clay and water; for the
twice-born, renunciation is the purifier; for Vedic scholars,
austerities; for the learned, tolerance; for the body, water; for those
who have sinned secretly, the repeating of mantras; for the mind, truth;
for all living beings, penance and learning; for the intellect,
knowledge; for the Conscious Being, the best purification consists in
the knowledge of God.’
