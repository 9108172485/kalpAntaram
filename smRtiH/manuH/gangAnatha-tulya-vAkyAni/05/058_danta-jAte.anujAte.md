*Parāśara* (3.21).—(Same as Manu.)

*Āpastamba* (2.15.3.4).—‘On account of the death of children who have
not completed their first year, the parents alone shall bathe—and those
who bury them.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.26-31).—In the case of the child dying immediately after
birth, or one who is still-born, the impurity of the family ceases
immediately; for such a child there is no cremation, nor
water-oblations; in that of a child that has teethed hut whose tonsure
has not been performed, the impurity lasts for a day and night; in that
of one whose tonsure has been done, hut no other sacrament, three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.18.23).—‘Impurity due to death lasts for three or ten
days; if the dead is a child less than two years old, the impurity
attaches to the parents only; and that due to the birth attaches to the
mother only. In the case of the death of children before teething, the
impurity is only for the moment; in that of those after teething but
before tonsure, it lasts for one night; in that of those after tonsure,
hut before Upanayana, for three days;—after that, for ten days.’
