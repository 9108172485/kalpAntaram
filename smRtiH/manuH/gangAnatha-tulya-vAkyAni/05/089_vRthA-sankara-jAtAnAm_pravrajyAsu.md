*Viṣṇu* (22.56).—‘Suicides and outcasts do not cause impurity or receive
offerings of water.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.6).—‘Those who have recourse to heretics, thieves,
women who have killed their husbands, loose women, and women drinking
wine, and women killing themselves, do not partake of impurity or of
water-offerings.’

*Vṛddha-Manu* (Aparārka, p. 876).—‘Eunuchs and others should not make
water-offerings, nor thieves and apostates, nor women who injure their
embryo and husband, or drink wine.’

*Vṛddha-Yājñavalkya* (Do.).—‘Persons killed by lightning, bulls, kings,
Brāhmaṇas, water, horned animals, tusked animals or fire, persons born
in vain, the eunuch, and the religious student are not deserving of
water-offerings.’

*Āpastamba* (Do., p. 877).—‘One who kills himself by means of fire,
water and such things,—for him there is no impurity; nor should water be
offered to him.’

*Gautama* (Do.).—‘For those who intentionally kill themselves by
starvation, or weapons, or fire or poison, or water (there shall be no
offering).’

*Aṅgiras* (Do.).—‘If one is killed, through carelessness, by fire, water
and such things, for him impurity shall be observed and water-offerings
made.’
