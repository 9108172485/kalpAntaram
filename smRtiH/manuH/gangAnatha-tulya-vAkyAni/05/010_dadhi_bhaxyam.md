*Gautama* (17.14).—(See above.)

*Baudhāyana* (1.12.14).—‘Stale food should not be eaten, except
pot-herbs, broths, meat, clarified butter, cooked grain, molasses, curds
and barley-meal.’

*Āpastamba* (1.17.19).—‘Excepting raw sugar, fried grain, curd-rice,
fried barley, barley-meal, vegetables, meat, wheat-cake, preparations of
milk, herbs, tree-roots and fruits (stale food shall not be eaten).’

*Viṣṇu* (51.42).—(See above.)

*Yājñavalkya* (1.169).—‘Food cooked overnight may be eaten, if it is
smeared with fatty oils, or if it has been kept for a long time;
preparations of wheat, barley and milk may be eaten even when not mixed
with fatty oils.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, 7.245).—‘Soured foods one should Dover eat; but in
times of distress they may be eaten after being washed; preparations of
lentil and māṣa, even though cooked overnight, one may eat after washing
them and mixing butter with them. Even though one may avoid soured
substances, one may eat such things cooked overnight as wheat-cakes,
rice-curd, fried grains, small cakes, barley-meal, vegetables, meat,
broths, rice-gruel, barley-flour and things mixed with fatty oils. Curds
and food mixed with molasses, when stale, should be avoided; so also
drinks prepared with honey and butter.’

*Devala* (Do.).—‘Even though soured, curd may be eaten, also
preparations of curd; drinks made of fruits and roots and flowers may be
eaten, if they are not intoxicating.’
