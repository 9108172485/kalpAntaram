*Baudhāyana* (1.10.34).—‘Where drops of water touch the feet of a man
who is offering water to others for washing, no defilement is caused by
them. They are as pure as water collected on the ground.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.42).—‘One is not defiled by the drops which fall on his
feet, while he is offering water to others for sipping; they are
declared to he as good as water on the ground.’

*Viṣṇu* (23.54).—‘Drops trickling on the feet of a man holding water for
others for sipping, are considered to be equal to waters springing from
the earth; by them he is not defiled.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.195).—(See above, under 139.)
