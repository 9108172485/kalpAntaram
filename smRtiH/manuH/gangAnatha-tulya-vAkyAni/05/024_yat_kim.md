*Viṣṇu* (51.35).—‘Preparations of barley and wheat mixed with oils,
soured substances and sugar-candy—barring these, if one eats anything
kept overnight, he should fast.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.169).—‘Food kept: overnight, or kept for a long time,
may he eaten if mixed with oils: as also preparations of wheat, barley
and milk, even without, oils.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 523).—‘Cakes, gruel, fried grains,
fried-barley flour, vegetables, meat, curries, rice-sesamum,
barley-meal, milk-vice, and things mixed with oils,—all this may he
eaten, even though kept overnight; hut substances soured by keeping
should he avoided.’
