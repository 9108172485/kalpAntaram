“In the *Mahābhārata* (13.114.36-49) this is ‘as told of old by
Mārkaṇḍeya’.”—Hopkins.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 251)—in *Mitākṣarā* (on 1.181),
as describing the eight kinds of ‘killer’;—and in *Smṛtisāroddhāra* (p.
301), which has the following notes:—‘*ghātakāḥ*’, partakers in the
sin,—‘*anumantā*’, who acquiesces in the act,—‘*viśasitā*’, who cuts the
limbs,—‘*nihantā*’, who actually does the act that deprives the animal
of the life,—‘*saṃskartā*,’ who cooks the meat,—‘*upahartā*’, who serves
the meat.
