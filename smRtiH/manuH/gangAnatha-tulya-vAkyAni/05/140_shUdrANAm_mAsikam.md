*Āpastamba* (2.3.5-8).—‘For Śūdras is prescribed the same rule of
sipping water as for their masters; besides the *Śūdra* cooks shall
daily have shaved the hair of their heads, of their beards, on their
bodies, and also their nails; and they shall bathe with clothes on; or
they may trim their hair and nails on the eighth day of each month, or
on the Full moon and Moonless days.’
