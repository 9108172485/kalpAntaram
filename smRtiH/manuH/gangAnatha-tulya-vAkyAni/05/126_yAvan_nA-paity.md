*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 270).—‘When there is defilement, the removal of
the stain, the grease and the smell, by means of earth, water, cowdung
and such things, constitutes *purification*.’

substance remains on the defiled object, so long must earth and water be
constantly applied, in all purifications of inanimate things.’
