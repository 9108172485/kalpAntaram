*Gautama* (14.31).—‘If he has followed a corpse, he shall purify himself
by bathing in his clothes.’

*Viṣṇu* (22.64).—‘If he has followed the corpse of a twice-born person,
he must go to a river and having plunged into it, repeat the
*Aghamarṣaṇa mantra* three times, and then coming out of the water,
repeat the *Gāyatrī*, a hundred and eight times.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.26).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa has followed the corpse of a
twice-born person or a Śūdra, he shall become pure by bathing in water,
touching fire and eating clarified butter.’

*Parāśara* (3.42-46).—‘(Same as Manu 102, then)—If the Brāhmaṇa, through
folly, follows the corpse of a Kṣatriya, he remains impure for one day
and becomes purified by eating *Pañcagavya*,—If a Brāhmaṇa, through
folly, follows a dead Vaiśya, he remains impure for two nights and after
that he should perform six breath-suspensions. If a foolish Brāhmaṇa
follow a dead Śūdra, he shall remain impure for three nights and after
the lapse of the third night, he shall go to a river that falls into the
ocean and having performed a hundred breath-suspensions, and eaten
clarified butter, he shall become purified.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 636).—‘In the case of a Kṣatriya
corpse being followed, purification comes after one day; in that of a
Vaiśya one, after two days; and in that of a Śūdra one, after three
days, followed by a hundred breath-suspensions.’
