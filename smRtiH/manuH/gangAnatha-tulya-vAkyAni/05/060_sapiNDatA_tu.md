*Āpastamba* (2.15.2).—‘On account of the blood-relations of his mother,

*Parāśara* (1.3.8).—‘In the case of descendants of a different caste,

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 589).—‘Those beginning with the
fourth ancestor, are *Partakers of the Smearing*; those beginning with

degrees.’

seventh degree, in the case of their being all of the same caste; in the
ease of their being of different castes, it ceases with the fourth
degree.’
