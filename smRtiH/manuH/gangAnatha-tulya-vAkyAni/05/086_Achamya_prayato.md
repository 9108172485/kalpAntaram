*Baudhāyana* (1.15.31).—‘If he has looked at any unclean substance, he
mutters the verse—“Unrestrained is the internal organ, wretched the
eye-sight, the sun is the chief of the lights; O *Dīkṣā*, do not forsake
me!”’

*Āpastamba* (Aparārka, p. 1197).—‘On seeing in the evening a *Caṇḍāla*
or an outcast, a woman in her courses or unclean things, he should look
at the rising sun.’

*Bodhāyana* (Aparārka, p. 1200).—‘On seeing the *Caṇḍāla*, one should
look at the stars; on talking to him, one should converse with the
Brāhmaṇa; on touching him, he shall bathe.’
