*Baudhāyana* (2.3.45).—‘hey quote the following:—“Their father protects
them in childhood; their husbands, in youth; their sons, in old age; a
woman is never fit for independence.”’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (5.2).—‘They quote the following:—“Their father protects them
in childhood; their husbands in youth; their sons, in old age; a woman
is never fit for independence.”’

*Viṣṇu* (25.13).—‘To remain subject, in her infancy, to her father, in
her youth, to her husband, and in her old age, to her sons (is the duty
of the woman).’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.85).—‘Her Father shall protect her while she is
unmarried; her husband, when she has been married; her sons in her old
age; in the absence of these, her relations shall protect her; the woman
nowhere has independence.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 109).—‘When she has no relations on either
side, the king is the supporter and master of the woman; he shall
support her and chastise her, if she deviates from the right path.’
