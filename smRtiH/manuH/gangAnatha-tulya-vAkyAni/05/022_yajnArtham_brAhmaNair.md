**(verses 5.22-23)  
**

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.5-8).—‘The Mānava text states:—“Only when he worships
Pitṛs and gods or honours guests, he may certainly slay animals: on
offering the honey-mixture to guests, and at rites in honour of Pitṛs
and gods and at a sacrifice,—on these occasions only may an animal be
slain.” The slaughter of animals at sacrifices is no slaughter. One may
cook a big ox or a big goat for a Brāhmaṇa or Kṣatriya guest.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.15).—‘It is declared in the Veda:—“At a sacrificial
session which lasted one thousand years, Agastya went out to hunt; he
had sacrificial cakes prepared with the meat of beasts and fowls good to
eat.”’

*Yājñavalkya* (Do.).—‘One who kills animals against the law, dwells in
terrible hell for as many years as there are hairs on the body of the
animal.’

*Yama and Paiṭhānaṣi* (Do.).—‘One should not kill any animal for his own
sake; if he cooks it for the sake of gods and Brāhmaṇas, he incurs no
sin,’
