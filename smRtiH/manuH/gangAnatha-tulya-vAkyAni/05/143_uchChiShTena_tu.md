*Baudhāyana* (1.8.27-30).—‘If he becomes impure while holding a
metal-vessel, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he
is going to take it up: if he becomes impure while he is occupied with
food, he shall put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going
to take it up. If he becomes impure while occupied with water, he shall
put it down, sip water and sprinkle it, when he is going to take it up.
That is contrary to rule in the case of an earthen vessel.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.43).—‘If, while occupied with eatables, he touches any
impure substance, then he shall place that thing on the ground, sip
water and then use it.’
