*Viṣṇu* (19.1).—‘One must not cause a dead member of a twice-born caste
to be carried by a Śūdra; nor a Śūdra by a twice-born person.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 634).—‘When a sacrificer dies, the Śūdra
shall not carry his dead body; that dead person for whom the Śūdra
carries fire, grass or wood, remains a *ghost* for ever and becomes
defiled by sin.’
