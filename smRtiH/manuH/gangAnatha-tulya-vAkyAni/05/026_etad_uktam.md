**(verses 5.26-27)  
**

*Yājñavalkya* (1.179).—‘When one’s life is in danger, at Śrāddhas, when
it has been prepared for Brāhmaṇas, and when it has been offered in the
worshipping cf gods and Pitṛs, if one eats meat, one incurs no sin.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 251).—‘Invited at a Śrāddha, if one abandons the
meat that is offered, one remains in hell, etc., etc.’

*Mahābhārata* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 528).—‘Now listen to the law
relating to Kṣatriyas. He incurs no sin if he eats meat obtained by his
own valour; all wild animals are such as have been already offered to
the gods by Agastya; that is why hunting is an honoured practice; it is
for this reason that all royal sages go about hunting, and thereby they
incur no sin.’

*Viśvāmitra* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 528).—(Same as Yājñavalkya,
above.)

*Devala* (Do.).—‘Eating meat in course of eating the remnants of
offerings, one incurs no sin; similarly, if one eats as a medicine, or
for saving his life, or by invitation, or at sacrifices.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 529).—‘One may eat consecrated meat
*once*, for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa; also when invited at a rite in
honour of gods or Pitṛs.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 529).—‘Under the following four
circumstances alone should one eat meat—(a) when suffering from an
otherwise incurable disease, (b) when duly invited, (a) when the meat
has been offered as a libation, and (d) when invited by a Brāhmaṇa.
Apart from these one shall never eat meat.’

*Hārīta* (Do. 530).—‘If one eat needlessly-prepared meat, one should
perforin the Kṛcchra. But for the sake of the Brāhmaṇas, he may eat as
much as he likes.’

*Visṇu* (Do.).—(Same as Manu 36.)
