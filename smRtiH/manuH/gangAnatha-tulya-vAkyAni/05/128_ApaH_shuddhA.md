*Baudhāyana* (1.9.10).—‘Water collected on the ground with which cows
slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not
strongly mixed with unclean substances, nor has smell, nor is
discoloured, nor has taste.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.35, 36, 47).—‘Water (for sipping) may be taken even out of
a hole in the ground, if it is sufficient to slake the thirst of cows.
He shall not purify himself with water that has been defiled with
colours, perfumes or flavouring substances; nor with such as is
collected in unclean places. Water collected on the ground that quenches
the thirst of the cows, the Lord of created things has declared to be
pure.’

*Viṣṇu* (23.43).—‘Stagnant water, if even a single cow can quench her
thirst with it, is pure, unless it is quite filled with unclean objects;
it is the same with water upon a rock.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.192).—‘Water in its natural condition, standing on the
ground, is pure, if it is sufficient to satisfy a cow.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 272).—‘That water is declared to he purificatory
which is devoid of smell and flavour, free from dirt, and such as would
not disappear if a cow were to drink out of it.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 273).—‘Water, at a drinking booth in the forest, or
in a jar, or in a well, or in a water-pot, or in a stone-cup, or in a
leather-bag, is unfit for drinking, except in times of distress.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 119).—‘Rain-water collected on the ground is
purified in ten nights.’
