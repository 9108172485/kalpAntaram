*Yajñavalkya* (1.176).—(See-above.)

*Parāśara* (2.9-10).—(See above.)

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 318).—‘Garlic, leek, onion, black
brinjal, mushroom, tame pig, fame; cock, milk of camel, woman or ass,-
on eating these one should undergo the Upanayana again and perform the
‘taptakṛcchra repeatedly.’

*Viṣṇu* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 319).—‘On eating the flesh of dogs, and on
eating mushrooms, one should perform the *Sāntapana*; on eating
substances cooked overnight,—except preparations of barley or wheat or
milk, or what is smeared with oils, or dry sugar-candy—one should fast.
Substances growing out of incisions or unclean things, the red exudation
from trees, needlessly cooked rice-sesamum,... on eating these one
should fast for three days and should stand in water for one day.’
