*Gautama* (14.20).—‘When a relative who is not a *Sapiṇḍa* or a relative
by marriage, or a fellow-student, has died, the impurity lasts for one
night along with the preceding and following days.’

*Gautama* (14.14).—‘If infants, relations living in a distant country,
those who have renounced domestic life, and those who are not
*Sapiṇḍas*, die, the purification is immediate.’
