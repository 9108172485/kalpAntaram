*Mahābhārata* (3.101.40).—(Same as Manu).

*Baudhāyana* (1.9.9).—‘The gods created for Brāhmaṇas three means of
purification—ignorance of defilement, sprinkling with water and
commending by word of mouth.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (14.24).—‘They quote the following words of Prajāpati—The
gods created for Brāhmaṇas, three means of purifying—Ignorance,
sprinkling and commending by word of mouth.’

*Viṣṇu* (2?.47).—‘The gods have declared, as peculiar to Brāhmaṇas,
three means of effecting purity—if the impurity has not been perceived,
if the object is sprinkled with water, if, in doubtful cases, they
commend it with speech.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.191).—(See under 124 then)—‘What is verbally cemmended
(commended?), or washed with water, or unknown (as defiled) is ever
pure.’
