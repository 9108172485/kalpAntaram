*Gautama* (14.23.10, 27).—‘On touching a corpse from an interested
motive, the impurity lasts for ten days. The duration of the impurity of
a Vaiśya and of a Śūdra (in the same case), twelve days, or half a
month, or a whole month, or as many days as there are seasons in the
year: The same rule applies to the higher castes. Or the impurity-lasts
three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.11).—‘For those who have touched a corpse as a duty,
and who desire immediate purification, such purification is accomplished
by Bathing and Breath-control.’

*Parāśara* (Mitākṣara, 3, 14).—‘Those twice-born persons who carry the
dead body of a Brāhmaṇa become purified immediately by bathing.’

*Viṣṇupurāṇa* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘If a man, on payment, burns the dead
body of a person of a different caste from himself, the period of his
impurity will be the same as that prescribed for the caste of the dead.’

*Parāśara* (Aparārka, p. 883).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is not defiled by touching
or cremating a dead body: if he carries it and applies fire to it, he
becomes purified immediately by bathing.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘Those who have touched the corpse shall not enter the
village till the stars become visible; and at night, till the appearance
of the sun.’
