*Baudhāyana* (1.9.1).—‘The Veda declares that the hand of the artisan is
always pure; so is vendible commodity exposed for sale and food obtained
by begging which a student holds in his hand.’

*Viṣṇu* (23.48).—‘The hand of a cook or other artisan, things exposed
for sale in a shop, food given to a Brāhmaṇa, and all manufactories or
mines are always pure.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.46).—‘A vendible commodity tendered for sale, and what is
not dirtied by gnats and flies that have settled on it (is pure).’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.187).—‘The artisan’s hand is pure; so also commodity
exposed for sale, alms and woman’s mouth.’ *Śaṅkha* (Aparārka, p.
263).—‘The artisan’s hand is pure, so also substances got out of mines
and washed.’
