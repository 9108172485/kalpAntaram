*Baudhāyana* (1.11.32-33).—‘If one unintentionally touches the corpse of
a stranger, he becomes pure by bathing in his clothes;—if he does it
intentionally, he remains impure for three days.’

*Parāśara* (3.39-41).—‘Those twice-born men who carry the dead body of a
Brāhmaṇa who has none of his own, obtain the rewards of sacrifices at
each step of the journey (to the cremation-ground); for those men of
meritorious acts, there is no sin or impurity, and they become purified
immediately by bathing; on carrying and burning the dead body of a
Brāhmaṇa who has no *sagotra* and no relations, one becomes purified by
breath-suspension.’

*Aṅgiras* (Panlśaramadhava, p. 631).—‘If one somehow carries the dead
body of one who is not his *sapiṇḍa*, he becomes pure the same day by
bathing in his clothes and touching fire.’

*Parāśara* (Aparārka, p 883).—‘The Brāhmaṇa is not defiled by touching
or cremating a dead body; one who carries it, and applies fire to it,
becomes pure after bathing.’
