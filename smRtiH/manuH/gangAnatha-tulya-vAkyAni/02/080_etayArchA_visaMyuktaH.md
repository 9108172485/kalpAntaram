*Viṣṇu-smṛti*, 55.14—\[reproduces, with slight variations, the words of
Manu\].

*Baudhāyana-Dhaṛmasūtra*, 2. 4. 15.—‘Those who offer not the
Morning-prayer before the advent of Dawn, nor the Evening-prayer before
the lapse of Eve,—how can these be called Brāhmaṇas? Those Brāhmaṇas who
offer? not the? Morning and Evening Prayers, them the king should employ
in works fit for the Śūdra.
