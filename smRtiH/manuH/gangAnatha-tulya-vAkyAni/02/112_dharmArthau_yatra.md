**(Verses 112-113)  
**

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.9).—‘Where merit and wealth are not
possible, nor is there an adequate desire to serve, there one may rather
perish with his learning, than sow it on barren soil.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (29.8).—(reproduces the words of Manu 112).

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 516).—‘Where there is no merit or
wealth, nor desire to serve nor clxance of riches,—there one may perish
along with his learning; he should never sow it on barren soil.’
