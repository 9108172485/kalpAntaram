*Hārīta-Smṛti*, 7.21,—‘That person is a *Nāstika* who decries what is
said in the Veda, who does not discriminate between virtue and vice and
who does not admit the existence of the other world.’

*Yājñavalkya*, 1-227.—‘The insulting of the Teacher, the decrying of the
Veda, the killing of a friend, all this should be regarded as equal to
the killing of the Brāhmaṇa.’
