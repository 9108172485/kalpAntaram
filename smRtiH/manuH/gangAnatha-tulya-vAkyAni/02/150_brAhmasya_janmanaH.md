*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2-48.—‘This is found in the case of the infant
Āṅgirasa.’

*Sūtasaṃhitā*, 6-31.—‘To regard the Teacher as a *child* or a *human
being* or an *uncultured person*,—is the result of ignorance.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 6.22-23.—‘Learning is superior to all; since it
forms the very basis of Dharma.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 305).—‘One should behave towards the
Teacher,—be he a child or of the same age as oneself,—as towards the
Guru.’
