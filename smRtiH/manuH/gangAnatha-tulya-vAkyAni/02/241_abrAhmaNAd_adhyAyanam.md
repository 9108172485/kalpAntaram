*Gautama* (7.1.3).—‘In times of distress the Brāhmaṇa may acquire
knowledge from the non-Brāhmaṇa;—there should be following and service
of such Teacher;—but after completion of the study, the Brāhmaṇa is to
be treated as superior.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.2.42-43).—‘One may read under a non-Brāhmaṇa also,
during times of distress;—so long as he is reading under him, he should
follow him, and attend upon him.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.4.25-27).—‘In times of distress, the Brāhmaṇa
may study under the Kṣatriya or the Vaiśya;—these teachers should be
followed;—but after the study, the Brāhmaṇa should have precedence.’

*Devala* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 513-514).—‘Wife, Knowledge,
Dharma, Purity, Literary Sayings, and the various Arts,—these may be
acquired from all.’
