*Viṣṇu* (28. 23).—‘One should not stay at a place where the teacher is
being defamed or censured.’

*Viṣṇu* (32. 8-11).—‘He should not address the teacher as *thou*;—in the
event of his insulting the teacher, he should fast for the day, and take
food in the evening, only after having propitiated the teacher;—one
should not talk to the teacher disputatiously;—should not utter anything
defamatory regarding the teacher;—nor anything not agreeable to him.’

*Viṣṇu* (45. 18).—‘One who is inimical to his teacher suffers from
epilepsy.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2. 17).—‘Those persons who, on being taught, respect not
their Teacher, by speech, mind and deed,—are as useless to them, as they
are to the Teacher.’
