[*Bhagavadgītā*,
3.5](http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/bhagavad-gita-3-5/ "Read English translation with commentaries").—‘Apart
from action done for sacrifice, all action tends to the bondage of men.’

[*Bhagavadgītā*,
5](http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/category/bhagavad-gita-chapter-5/ "Read English translation with commentaries").—‘Renouncing
the fruit of the act, if one engages himself in it with a concentrated
mind, he attains eternal peace; doing it without concentration, and
drawn by desire to the fruit of the act, he becomes bound.’

*Ibid*, 6.27.—‘If one performs an act as a duty, without any regard for
its fruit, etc.’

*Ibid*, 9.20.—‘Men learned in the three Vedas, drinking Soma, having
their sins washed off, perform sacrifices and seek to go to heaven;
having reached the sacred regions of Indra, they enjoy, in heaven,
pleasures fit for the gods.’

*Sūtasaṃhitā*, 3.4.—‘It is only the unfortunate people who, imbued with
due faith, betake themselves to acts prescribed as leading to certain
desirable results; those are extremely fortunate who engage themselves
only in those daily and occasional acts that are obligatory; for these
latter liberation is obtained without effort; doing with due faith, as
they do, every act simply because it is enjoined by the scriptures.’

[*Āpastaṃba*, *Dharmasūtra*,
1.20.1-2](/hinduism/book/apastamba-dharma-sutra/d/doc116252.html "Read English translation by Bühler").—‘One
should not do his duties with the view to attain worldly ends;—those
that bring no fruits are conducive to good.’

*Ibid*, 1.21-5.—‘Having fully comprehended the nature of acts, one
should undertake that which he likes.’
