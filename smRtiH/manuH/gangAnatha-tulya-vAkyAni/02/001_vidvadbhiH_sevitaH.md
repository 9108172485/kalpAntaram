*Vaśiṣṭha, Dharmaśāstra*—‘Dharma is that which is enjoined in Śruti and
Smṛti.’

*Jaimini, Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra*, 1.1.2.—‘Dharma is that which is described in
the Veda as conducive to good.’

*Kaṇāda, Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra*, 1.2.2.—‘That is Dharma which brings about
prosperity and the highest good.’

*Āpastamba, Dharma-Sūtra*, 1.20.7.—‘That the doing whereof gentlemen
praise is *Dharma*, and that which they deprecate is *Adharma*.’

*Kumārila, Ślokavārtika*, 2.14.—‘The fact of these acts being conducive
to good is, in every case, learnt from the Veda; and in this sense are
they regarded as *Dharma*; and for this reason Dharma is not perceptible
by the senses.’

*Viśvāmitra* (quoted in Parāśaramādhava, p. 80).—‘That the doing of
which men learned in the scriptures praise is *Dharma*; that which they
deprecate is called *Adharma*.’

Under all these definitions ‘Dharma’ is the name of the ‘meritorious
*act*’; but the term has also been used in the sense of the *merit*
acquired by the doing of the act.

Nyāya view (quoted in Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā, p.29).—‘Dharma is that
quality of man which is brought about by the performance of the enjoined
act: *Adharma* is that quality of man which is brought about by the
performance of the forbidden act.’
