*Baudhāyana* (1.2.5).—‘All Vedas enter into him who learns and behaves
thus; just as fire supplied with fuel shines brightly, so shines he who
knowing this follows the life of the Religious Student.’

*Vyāsa Smṛti* (1.36, 37).—‘In this manner, living, from day to day, on
alms, the Religious Student should keep his vows; speaking agreeably,
avoiding.calumny,-, always accomplishing the needs of his teacher; from
beginning to end of his Vedio Study, he should constantly attend upon
him; studied in this manner, the Vedic Mantra carries the Brāhmaṇa
forward.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.14.5).—‘Service of the Teacher is the only
means.’

*Nārada* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 525).—‘Knowledge is acquired by
service of the Teacher, or by much wealth, or by knowledge (in
exchange); there is no fourth means;—the white ants rear up a huge heap
by collecting small particles of dust: it is not strength that
accomplishes this but only effort; gradually and slowly is learning
acquired, gradually and slowly are riches attained, gradually and slowly
is the hill ascended, gradually and slowly is the rags-cover made up;
and gradually is the journey accomplished.’
