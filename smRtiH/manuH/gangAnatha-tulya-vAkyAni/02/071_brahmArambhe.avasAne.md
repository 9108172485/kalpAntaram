*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.3.10.—‘The teacher’s fee? should be clasped
at both times,—at the time when one is going to read and also when he
has read.’

*Viṣṇu-Smrti*, 30, 32.—‘At the beginning and at the end of the reading
of Veda, the clasping of the teacher’s feet should be done.’

*Yājñavalkya*. 1. 26.—‘Then declaring himself—*here I am*—he should
approach the teacher for purposes of study.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1. 52, 59.—‘Clasping the left feet with his hand,
he should address the teacher “*Please sir teach me*”; and he should
clasp his feet at the beginning and at the end of the expounding of the
Veda.’

*Aṅgiras* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 523-524).—‘At the approach of the
Vedic lecture, and also at its close, the teacher’s feet should be
clasped, as also when one returns from a journey.’ *Āśvalāyana-Smṛti*
(Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, 9. 524).—‘The left hand with palm upwards, and
the right with the palm downwards, the backs of the hands being firmly
attached, the thumbs being firmly steady,—this attitude of the hands is
called *Brahmāñjali*, because of its having been adopted first of all by
Brahmā. This has to be adopted at the beginning of Vedic study, also at
its completion, during the Brahmayajña, and also during the time that
the *Sāvitrī* is being taught.’

*Saṃvarta* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, 9. 524).—‘Then he should road the
Veda, looking at the teacher’s face, keeping the hands in control,
placed over the knees.’
