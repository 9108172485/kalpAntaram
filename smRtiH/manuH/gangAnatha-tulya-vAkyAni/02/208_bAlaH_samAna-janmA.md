*Viṣṇu* (28.31-33).—‘One should behave towards the teacher’s son who
imparts instruction to him just as he would towards the teacher
himself,—whether he be younger than him or of the same age;—he should
not wash his feet;—nor should he eat his leavings.’

*Gautama* (2.38,39).—‘He should behave similarly towards ṭhe teacher’s
wife and his sons;—but should not eat his leavings, or bathe him, or
dress his hair, or wash his feet, or rub his body, or clasp his feet.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.2.37).—‘Towards the teacher’s son, or towards the
expounder of the Veda, one should behave similarly, with the exception
of eating his leavings.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (1.7.30).—‘I he behaviour towards the teacher’s
son should be like that towards the teacher himself,—with the exception
of eating the leavings.’
