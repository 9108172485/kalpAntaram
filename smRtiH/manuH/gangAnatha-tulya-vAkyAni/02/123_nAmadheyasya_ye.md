*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (13.1.1).—‘*Here I am*—he should say only this much,
when saluting a person who is not learned enough to know the proper form
of returning the salutation.’

*Āpastamba* (Aparārka, p. 54).—‘Elderly ladies one shall salute with
bowing the head; all ladies are to be saluted with one’s name; not so
one’s mother or the wives of Elders—say some.’
