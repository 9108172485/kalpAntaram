*Bhaviṣya-purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 474)—(has the verse of
Manu, to which it adds another verse to the effect that)—‘the Brāhmaṇa
has thus been declared by the wise the Kṣatriya’s father, the Vaiśya’s
grand-father and the Śūdra’s great-grand-father.’

*Śātātapa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, pp. 473-474).—‘Agni is the superior
of the Twice-born men, the Brāhmaṇa is the superior of all castes.’

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramāḍhava, p. 299).—‘The Kṣatriya and the rest should
never be saluted by the Brāhmaṇa, even though they be endowed with
knowledge and of good conduct and very learned.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.8.21).—‘The Kṣatriya, hundred years old and the
Brāhmaṇa, ten years old, should he regarded as father and son; of the
two, the Brāhmaṇa being the superior.’
