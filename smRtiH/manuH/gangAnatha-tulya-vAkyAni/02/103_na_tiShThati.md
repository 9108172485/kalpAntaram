*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.15).—‘Here are two verses recited by
Prajāpati—One who does not worship the Morning Twilight before its
advent, and who does not worship the Evening Twilight before its
lapse,—how can they be regarded as Brāhmaṇa? Those Brāhmaṇas who worship
not the Morning and Evening Twilights, them the righteous king would be
free to employ in the works of Śūdras.’

*Dakṣa (Parāśaramādhava*, p. 268).—‘The man devoid of the Twilight
Prayers is unclean and unfit for all rites.’

*Gobhila* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 278).—‘One who knows not, and observes
not the Twilight Prayers,—while living—he remains a Śūdra, and on death
becomes born as a dog.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 278).—‘Those who observe not the
Morning or Evening Prayers, those evil-minded ones fall into the darkest
hell.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘If one neglects the Twilight
Prayers, and devotes his attention to other acts, he falls into ten
thousand hells.’

*Yājñavalkya* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa, except when
he is ill, omits the Twilight Prayers, he incurs sin and is despised in
the world.’

*Atri* (*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 379).—‘Those who, while in good health,
observe not the Twilight Prayers,—are wicked and injure the sun.’
