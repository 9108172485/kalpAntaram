*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1.51-56.—‘The sense-organs should be touched with
Kuśa-blades;—there should be three Breath-suspensions, of fifteen units;
and the seat should be on Kuśa-grass pointing eastwards.’

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2.4.5,7.—‘At the commencement of the
performance of all acts, as also before the Twilight Prayers, one should
sprinkle himself with the sanctifying blades and thereby prepare
himself;—to this effect it is declared that seated on Kuśa-blades,
holding Kuśa-blades in the hand, sprinkling himself with water, one
should repeat the Gāyatrī a thousand times;—being purified with three
Breath-suspensions.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 254).—‘Seated on Kuśa-blades
pointing eastwards, with mind collected, he should perform throe
Breath-suspensions and then the Twilight Prayers.’
