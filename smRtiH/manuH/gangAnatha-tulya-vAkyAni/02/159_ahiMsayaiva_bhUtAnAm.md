hurting him; in case of this being impossible, the chastisement should
be inflicted by means of a thin rope or a thin piece of split bamboo.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.8.28-29.—‘In the case of the pupil committing
some fault, the Teacher should admonish him; and until the pupil
desists, the following punishments may be inflicted in accordance with
the gravity of the offence: threatening, fasting, water-bath, refusing
to see him.’
