*Vaśiṣṭha* (13.14).—‘He should simply say *Here I am*, when saluting one
who knows not the form of the return-greeting.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 465).—‘On being saluted, if one does
not offer his blessing, a part of the saluter’s sins falls upon the
person saluted. To the Brāhmaṇa he should say *svasti* (all may be
well), to the Kṣatriya *āyuṣyam* (long-life), to the Vaiśya *vardhatām*
(may you prosper), to the Śūdra *ārogyam* (freedom from disease).’

\[Yama also reproduces Manu’s Verse.\]

*Bhaviṣya-purāṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 298).—‘On bring saluted, if one
does not return the salutation, or if one does not pronounce the
blessing, one falls into many hells.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (7.42).—‘*Welfare, Freedom from* *Distemper* ,
*Freedom from Loss* and *Freedom from Disease*, the asking of these
constitutes the return-greeting; the last being for the Śūdra.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.14.26-29).—‘One should ask one who is not
senior, also one of the same age, about his *welfare*; the Kṣatriya
about his *freedom from distemper*;—the Vaiśya about *freedom from
loss*;—the Śūdra about *freedom from disease*.’
