*Pāraskara-Gṛhyasūtrā*, 1. 17.4.—‘*Śarma* for the Brāhmaṇa, *Varma* for
the Kṣatriya, *Gupta* for the Vaiśya.’

*Vyāsa-Smṛti* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 213).—‘*Śarma* is the name
commended for the Brāhmaṇa, *Varma* for the Kṣatriya, *Gupta* for the
Vaiśya, and *Dāsa* for the Śūdra.’

*Yama-Smṛti* (Do.).—‘*Śarma* and *Deva* for the Brāhmaṇa, *Rājā* for the
Kṣatriya, *Gupta* and *Datta* for the Vaiśya and *Dāsa* for the Śūdra.

These titles have been thus explained by Āśvalāyanāchārya:—‘The name of
the Brāhmaṇa should end with *Śarma* because he imparts *Śarma*
(happiness) to the world through his religious character, calmness and
self-control; that of the Kṣatriya should end with *Varmā*, because like
the *Varma* (armour), he protects the world from the three kinds of
pain; that of the Vaiśya should end with *Gupta*, because he fosters
(*gopāyati*) the people by giving them money at certain times; that of
the Śūdra should end with *Dāsa*, because he keeps the twice-born people
satisfied by constant service.’
