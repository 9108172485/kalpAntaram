*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 402).—‘In former times, for girls
also there was Upanayana, also the teaching of the Veda and the
pronouncing of the Sāvitrī. But she should be taught by her father,
uncle or brother, none else. For the girl, alms-begging is to be done in
her own home; and she should avoid the skin, the rags and also matted
locks.’
