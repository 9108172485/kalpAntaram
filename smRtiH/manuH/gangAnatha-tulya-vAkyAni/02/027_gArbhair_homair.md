**(Verses 27 and 28)  
**

*Sumantu* (Vīra-Saṃskāra, p. 131).—‘The sacraments common to the
Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya, are the following—Garbhādhāna,
Sīmantonnayana, Jātakarma, Nāmakaraṇa, Annaprāśana, Cūḍā, Upanayana,
Vratacaryā, Adhyayana, Samāvartana, Vivāha, Yajña and Dāna.’

*Hārīta* (*Ibid*, p. 135).—‘There are two kinds of Sacraments—Brāhma and
Daiva; the Garbhādhāna and the rest ending with Snāna, which are
proscribed in the Smṛtis, are “brāhma”; the Pākayajñas, the Haviryajñas
and the Somayajñas are “daiva”.’

*Jātūkarṇya* (*Ibid*, p. 135).—‘The sixteen sacramental rites are the
following—

> \(1\) Ādhāna,  
> (2) Puṃsavana,  
> (3) Sīmanta,  
> (4) Jāta,  
> (5) Nāma,  
> (6) Anna,  
> (7) Chaula,  
> (8) Mauñjī,  
> (9-12) the four Vratas,  
> (13) Godāna,  
> (14) Samāvartana,  
> (15) Vivāha,  
> and (16) Antya.’

*Āṅgiras* (*Ibid*).—‘

> \(1\) Garbhādhāna,  
> (2) Puṃsavana,  
> (3) Sīmanta,  
> (4) Bali,  
> (5) Jātakṛtya,  
> (6) Nāmakaraṇa,  
> (7) Niṣkrama,  
> (8) Annaprāśana,  
> (9) Chaulakarma,  
> (10) Upanayana,  
> (11-14) the Four Veda-vratas,  
> (15) Snāna,  
> (16) Udvāha,  
> (17) Āgrayaṇa,  
> (18) Aṣṭakā,  
> (19) Śrāvaṇī,  
> (20) Āśvayujī,  
> (21) Mārgaśīrṣī,  
> (22) Pārvaṇa,  
> (23) Utsarga,  
> (24) Upākaraṇa,  
> (25) Mahāyajñas;

these are the obligatory sacraments, specially for the Brāhmaṇa. It is
by means of the sacraments that Brāhmaṇahood comes to be gradually
manifested.’

*Āśvalāyana* (*Ibid*, p. 136).—‘The five mahāyajñas are to be performed
daily; the sixteen cuding with Marriage are *naimittīka*, to be done on
prescribed occasions; the Pārvaṇa is to be done every month, or if this
be not possible, then every year; the seven sacrifices beginning with
Āgrayaṇa are to be performed once in the year.’

*Gautama* (*Ibid*, p. 137).—‘The following are the 10 Sacraments—

> \(1\) Garbhādhāna,  
> (2) Puṃsavana,  
> (3) Sīmantonnayana,  
> (4) Jātakarma,  
> (5) Nāmakaraṇa,  
> (6) Annaprāśana,  
> (7) Chaula,  
> (8) Upanayana,  
> (9-12) the four Veda-vratas,  
> (13) Snāna,  
> (14) Sahadharmacāriṇīsaṃyoga,  
> (15-19) the five mahāyajñas,  
> (20-26) the seven Pākayajñas—Aṣṭakā, Pārvaṇa-Śrāddba, Śrāvanī,
> Āgrahāyaṇī, Caitrī and Āśvayujī,  
> (27-33) the seven Haviryajñas—Agnyādheya, Agnihotra, Darśapūrṇamāsa,
> Cāturmāsya, Āgrayaṇeṣṭi, Nirūdhapaśubandha, and Sautrāmaṇi,  
> (33-40) the seven Somayajñas—Agniṣṭoma, Atyagniṣṭoma, Ukthya, Ṣoḍasbī,
> Vājapeya, Atirātra and Āptoryamā’

...‘He who has not had these forty sacraments, nor is endowed with the
eight qualities of the soul (sympathy for all beings, forgiveness,
freedom from jealousy, purity, equanimity, good character,
non-miserliness) is never united to Brahman, nor does he attain the
regions of Brahman.’

*Hārita* (*Ibid*, p. 130).—‘He who has been sanctified by the Brāhma
Sacraments becomes equal to the sages and becomes united with them and
attains their regions; and he who is sanctified by the Daiva sacraments
becomes equal to the gods, is united with them and reaches their
regions.’

*Do*. (Aparārka, p. 25).—‘When the women of the twice-born castes are
sanctified by the performance of a single sacrament, every child that
they bear thereafter becomes sanctified thereby.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (*Ibid*, p. 110).—‘The Brāhmaṇa who is endowed with the
two sets of sacraments and is equipped with the eight qualities (of the
soul) attains the regions of Brahman.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 25).—‘Just as a picture becomes manifested
through the gradual appearance of the several limbs, in the same manner
Brāhmaṇahood becomes manifested through the lawful performance of the
sacraments.’
