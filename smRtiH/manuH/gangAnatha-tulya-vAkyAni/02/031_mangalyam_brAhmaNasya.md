*Śaṅkha* (Smṛti, 2.3).—‘The name of all castes should consist of an even
number of letters; an auspicious one for the Brāhmaṇa, one endowed with
strength for the Kṣatriya.’

*Viṣṇu* (Smṛti, 1.27.6-9).—‘The Brāhmaṇa’s name should be expressive of
auspiciousness—the Kṣatriya’s expressive of strength,—the Vaiśya’s
expressive of wealth,—the Śūdra’s expressive of depreciation.’

*Vīramitrodaya* (Śaṃskāra, p. 237).—Names are of four kinds;

1.  connected with family-deity,
2.  connected with month,
3.  connected with asterism,
4.  and temporal.

(*a*) Says Śaṅkha.—‘The father should fix a name connected with the
family-deity,’ *i.e*., a name consisting of words expressive of the
Deity.

(*b*) Gārgya.—‘The father should impart to the hoy the name of the month
and the name of the preceptor. The months have been declared to have the
following names:—

1.  Mārgaśīrṣa—Kṛṣṇa,
2.  Pauṣa—Ananta,
3.  Māgha—Achyuta,
4.  Phālguna—Chakrī,
5.  Caitra—Vaikuṇṭha,
6.  Vaiśākha,—Janārdana,
7.  Jyaiṣṭha,—Upendra,
8.  Āṣāḍha—Yajñapuruṣa.
9.  Śrāvaṇa—Vāsudeva.
10. Bhādra—Hari,
11. Āśvina—Yogīśa,
12. Kārttika—Puṇḍarīkākṣa.’

(*c*) Śaṅkha-Likhita.—‘Either the father or some other senior member of
the family should fix a name connected with the asterism.’ This name has
been held to be the one to be used when the person bearing the name
accosts a superior.

Says Baudhāyana—‘This name in accordance with the asterism is the secret
one, which is known only to the father and the mother and which the boy
is to use in accosting.’

Also Āśvalāyana—‘The accosting name should be known only to the father
and the mother; as it is under this name that the boy is initiated.’

Also Śaunaka, ‘That name under which he is to be initiated, and by which
he will do the accosting of the teacher,—should also be fixed at the
time of the naming ceremony. This accostive name should be pronounced by
the father very silently, so that others may not know it. This
initiative name the parents should bear in mind.’

Like the names attached to the months the names attached to the
asterisms are as follows:—

1.  Agni (Kṛttikā),
2.  Prajāpati (Rohiṇī),
3.  Soma (Mṛgaśiras),
4.  Rudra (Ārdrā),
5.  Diti (Punarvasū),
6.  Bṛhaspati (Puṣvā),
7.  Sarpa (Aśleṣā),
8.  Pitṛ (Maghā),
9.  Bhaga (Purvaphalgunī),
10. Aryamā (Uttaraphalgunī),
11. Savitṛ (Hastā),
12. Tvaṣtṛ (Chitrā),
13. Āyuṣ (Svātī),
14. Indra-Agni (Viśākhā),
15. Mitra (Anurādhā),
16. Indra (Jyeṣṭhā),
17. Nirṛti (Mūlā),
18. Apas (Pūrvāṣāḍhā),
19. Viśvedevas (Uttarāṣāḍhā),
20. Viṣṇu (Śravaṇā),
21. Vasu (Dhaniṣṭhā),
22. Varuṇa (Śatabhiṣa),
23. Ajaikapāt (Pūrvabhādra),
24. Ahirbudhnya (Uttarabhādra),
25. Pūṣan (Revatī),
26. Aśvins (Aśvinī),
27. Yama (Bharaṇī).

But according to Baudhāyana, the “name connected with the asterism” is
in accordance with the names of the asterisms themselves—such as
‘Rohiṇī,’ ‘Bharaṇī,’ and the rest; and not in accordance with the name
of the deity attached to each asterism. According to the astrologers
however each asterism has four letters assigned to it (such as
*chū-che-cho-la*, assigned to Aśvinī, and so forth, and “the name
connected with the asterism of Aśvinī,” would be the name whose first
letter consists of one of these four letters).

(*d*) The ‘temporal name’ has been described by Bṛhaspati as ‘conducive
to all kinds of business.’ It is this name that has been laid down by
Āśvalāyana as having for its first letter one of the ghoṣa-letters, in
its middle one of the *antastha* letters; ending with the *visarga*,
containing either two or four vowels; and in male names the number of
letters should always be even.

But Baijavāpa—‘The father fixes the name, which consists of either two
or three or four letters, or of unlimited number of letters.’

Vaśiṣṭha—‘The name should consist of either two or four vowels, but
those ending in *l* or *r* should be avoided.’

The Mahābhāṣya—‘The first letter of the name should be *ghoṣa-vat*, the
middle one of the *antastha* letters, it should not be similar to the
names of the ancestors, or of the enemy; it should be one formed with a
verbal affix, not with a nominal affix.’

Āśvalāyana—‘That name is best which consists of either four or two
letters, which is in consonance with that of the *grandfather*’ (this
last includes also the *gods*).

Kapila-Saṃhitā—‘On the eleventh day, in due form, the name should be
given, which is in consonance with the family-custom, and resembles the
name of the gods or of the parents.’

*Baijavāpa* (Aparārka, p. 27).—‘The father gives a name either of one
letter or two letters or three letters or four letters, or of letters
without limit; it should be one formed with a verbal, never with a
nominal, affix.’
