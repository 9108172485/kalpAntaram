See above, verse 142.

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1-12.—‘Also because he expounds the Veda,’

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti*, 3.24.—‘He who teaches a portion of the Veda and the
Vedic subsidiaries is the *Upādhyāya*.’

*Atri*, 9-10.—‘There is no substance in the world by giving which one
could become freed from the debt owing to that Teacher who teaches even
a single syllable to his pupil. One who honours not the Teacher who has
taught him even a single syllable (is a sinner).’

*Yājñavalkya*, 1-34.—‘He who teaches a portion is the *Upādhyāya*: he is
a *Guru* who, having performed the rite, imparts to him the Veda.’

*Hārīta* (see under 142).
