*Vasiṣṭha-smṛti*, 5-6.—‘The one syllable is Brahman Supreme;
Breath-suspension is the highest penance; alms-begging is superior to
fasting; and compassion is superior to charity.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti*, 55 17—\[reproduces the words of Manu\].

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 321).—‘The syllable *om* is the highest
Brahman; Breath-suspension is the highest penance; there is nothing
superior to the Sāvitrī; Truth is superior to silence;—all Vedic acts
may dwindle away, but the syllable should be recognised as never
dwindling;—the highest Brahman in the shape of the single syllable has
been declared

to be the best purifier; there is nothing superior to the Gāyatri; Truth
is superior to silence. Daily one should repeat the Gāyatrī, 1,000 or
100 or at least 10 times, as destructive of all sins.’
