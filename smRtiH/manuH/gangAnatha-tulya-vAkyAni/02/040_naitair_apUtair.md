*Āpastamba-Gṛhyasūtra*, 1.1.33; 1.2.6.—‘With these (apostates) one
should avoid association, dining and marriage; in the event of their
being desirous of expiating (the omission and the consequent apostacy),
they should keep, for twelve years, the observances relating to Vedic
studies, and then undergo the Upanayana, and be sprinkled with water
with Pāvamānī and other mantras.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti*, 11.55.—‘They should not perform their Upanayana, nor
teach them, nor sacrifice for them, nor marry them.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasütra*, 1.19.7.—‘They should not perform their
Upanayana, nor teach them, nor sacrifice for them, nor have any dealings
with them.’ \[The Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 349, explains ‘dealings’ to
mean ‘marriage-connection.’\]

*Pāraskara* - *Gṛhyasūtra*, 2.5.40.—\[Exactly the same as above.\]

*Gobhila-Gṛhyasūtra*, 2.10.6.—‘They should not perform their Upanayana,
nor teach them, nor sacrifice for them, nor have marriage-relations with
them.’

*Baudhāyana-Smṛti* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 348).—‘There are no rites
for the apostate until he passes through the Upanayana; so long as he is
not born in the Veda, he remains like a Śūdra.’

*Āśvalāyana-Smrti* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 349).—‘No dealings—either
Vedic (tutorial), or marital or commercial,—should he ever held with
them by any cultured person who is true to his *dharma*.’
