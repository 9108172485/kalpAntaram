*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 5.1.5-8.—‘The Sacred Thread worn at sacrifices
to gods (*upavīta*) consists of the silk or the cotton thread folded
three times three: it should reach down to the navel; the right arm
being held above;—the reverse (*prāchīnāvita*) at offerings to Pitṛs;
hanging by the neck, it is *nivīta*; hanging downwards it is
*adhovīta*.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 1.6.18-19.—‘He who is wearing the Sacred Thread
in the *upavīta* form is to be regarded as wearing two pieces of
cloth;—while he who is wearing it in the *Adhovīta* form, is to be
regarded as wearing only one piece of cloth.’

*Gobhila-Gṛhyasūtra*, 1.2.2-3.—‘Holding aloft the right arm, passing
over the head, resting the thread on the left shoulder, hanging down the
right arm-pit,—thus does he become the *wearer* *of* *the Yajñopavīta*;
lifting the left arm, passing over the head, resting the thread on the
right shoulder, hanging down the left arm-pit,—thus does he become the
*wearer of* *the* *Prāchīnāvīta*.’
