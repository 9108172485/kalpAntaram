*Vyāsa-ṣmrti* (4.13), (*also Vṛddha Śātātapa*, 61).—‘Having brought his
senses under control, wherever a man may live,—that place is Kurukṣetra,
Naimiṣa and Puṣkara.’

*Vyāsasmṛti* (4. 60-61).—‘One does not become heroic by obtaining
victory in battle; nor does he become learned by study; nor an orator by
mere eloquence; nor liberal by making gifts of wealth; by conquering the
organs does one become heroic; by following Dharma, learned,—by
truthfulness, an orator; and liberal, by doing good to all beings.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-smṛti* (25. 8).—‘Wisdom is attained by Yoga; Yoga is the
characteristic of Dharma; Yoga is ever the highest penance; therefore
one should be always addicted to Yoga.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (5. 28).—‘The wise man, having his senses, Manas and
Buddhi under control, having his heart fixed upon Liberation, with all
his desires, fear and auger gone,—is ever free.’
