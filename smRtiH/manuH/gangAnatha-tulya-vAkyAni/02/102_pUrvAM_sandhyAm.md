*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (26. 2. 8).—(See under 101.)

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2. 4. 18-21).—‘The sin committed through the
reproductive organs, through the feet, through the arms, through the
mind, through speech,—from all this one becomes absolved by offering the
Evening Prayers. If one offers the Evening Prayers, him Varuṇa captures
not. Similarly by offering the Morning Prayers, one becomes absolved
from sins committed during the night.’

*Yama (Parāśaramādhava*, p. 278).—‘Those who constantly observe the
Twilight have their sins removed;... whatever sin is committed during
the day, by act, mind and word, all that one destroys by means of the
Evening Prayers and by Breath-control; whatever sin is committed during
the night, all that one destroys by means of the Morning Prayers and by
Breath-control.’
