*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (1.2.20-21).—‘Within sight of the Teacher one
should avoid the following—sitting with a piece of cloth passing round
the neck and the two knees, spreading out of the legs, spitting,
laughing, yawning, finger-snapping.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (1.2.31).—‘One should leave his bed or seat before
answering the Teacher’s call.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1 6.3-5).—‘One should not put forward his legs
towards the Teacher;—some people hold that no such spreading is
reprehensible when the Teacher is seated on a bedstead;—near the Teacher
one should speak to him lying down.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.8-11).—‘One should not sit on the bed or the
seat before the Teacher.’
