**(Verses 93-95)  
**

*Dakṣa-smṛti* (7. 12 and 16).—‘He whose mind is addicted to objects
never attains Yoga; therefore the Yogin should make an effort to avoid
addiction to objects.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-smṛti* (30.10-11).—‘As one grows old, his hairs fade fade also
his teeth; but longing for life and longing for wealth never fade, even
while the man is fading away. That which cannot be avoided by
foolish-minded persons, that which does not fade even while the man is
fading away, that which is a mortal disease,—such Desire when one
renounces, then alone does he attain happiness.’
