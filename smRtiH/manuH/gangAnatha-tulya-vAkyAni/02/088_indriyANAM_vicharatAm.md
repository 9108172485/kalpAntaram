*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 3.9—‘One who behaves like this keeps the senses
under control attains the regions of Brahman.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 11.4.—‘Pure, with senses under control, equipped
with fully qualified-aids.’

*Kaṭha*-*Upaniṣad*, 3.6.—‘He who is equipped with knowledge, with mind
composed, has his senses under control; just as good horses are under
ṭhe control of the charioteer.’

*Bhagavadgītā*, 2.67-68.—‘When the mind follows in the wake of the
roaming sense-organs, it deprives him of his wisdom; just as the storm
destroys the boat in water. Therefore that man whose sense-organs have
been withdrawn from the objects of sense, has his wisdom firmly
established.’
