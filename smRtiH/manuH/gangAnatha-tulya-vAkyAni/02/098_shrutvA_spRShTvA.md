*Śaṅkha-smṛti* (7. 8-9).—‘One should never mind it—whether his body is
smeared with sandal-paste, or ripped by an axe, or he attains prosperity
or adversity. Equally friendly towards all beings, looking equally upon
gold and Upon a clod of earth, fixed in contemplative meditation, the
Brāhmaṇa attains the highest state.’

*Viṣṇu-smṛti* (96. 23).—‘While one arm is being ripped with an axe and
another is being smeared with sandal-paint,—and while, on the one hand,
he meets with prosperity, and on the other, with adversity,—he should
not mind either.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (2. 57).—‘He who has no attachment to, anything, and on
meeting with happiness, neither rejoices nbr‘is grieved, his wisdom is
firm.’

*Bhagavadgītā* (5. 20).—‘One should not rejoice on coming by happiness;
nor should he become ruffled on coming by unhappiness; he whose mind is
firm, never deluded, he knows Brahman, and rests in Brahman.’
