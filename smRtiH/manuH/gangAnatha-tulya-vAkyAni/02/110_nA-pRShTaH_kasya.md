*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (2.18).—‘The Veda should not be taught to one who is
not prepared to render such respect as lies within his power.’

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra* (2.50).—‘If a question regarding the Veda is
asked without due respect, it destroys the questioner, as fire burns
straw; therefore the Veda should not be expounded to those who do not
render proper respect.’
