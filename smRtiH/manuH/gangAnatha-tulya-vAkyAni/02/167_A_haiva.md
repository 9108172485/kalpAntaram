*Baudhāyana* (2. 2. 1).—‘Always wearing the Sacred Thread, always
reading the Veda...... the Brāhmaṇa falls not from the Brāhmic regions.’

*Smṛtisārasamuccaya* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 510).—‘He who hears the
Veda in his body is never touched by sin.’

*Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 512).—‘Just as fire burns even wet
trees, so does one knowing the Veda burn all the evil in one’s self.’
