*Bodhāyana* (3.3.1-3, 9-12),—‘Hermits belong to two classes—those who
cook, and those who do not cook, food;—those who cook are of five
kinds—those who eat everything that the forest contains, those who live
on unhusked grain, those who eat bulbs and roots, those who eat fruits
and those who eat pot-herbs. Those who do not cook are of five
kinds—those who avoid the use of iron and other implements, those who
ṭake food with the band, those who take it with the mouth, those who
subsist on water only, and those who live on air only.’

*Viṣṇu* (95, 14, 15).—‘He shall break his food with stones; or he shall
use his teeth as a pestle.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3, 49).—‘He shall use his teeth as the pestle; or he may
eat only such fruits as ripen in their own time; or he may use stone for
breaking what he eats.’
