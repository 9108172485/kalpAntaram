*Baudhāyana* (2.18.13).—‘The following arc the vows for the
Renunciate:—Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness,
abstention from appropriating the property of others, continence and
liberality. There are five minor vows:—*viz*., abstention from anger,
obedience to the Teacher, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness and purity
in eating.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.61).—‘Having controlled the host of senses, having
renounced love and hate, and having abandoned fear, the Brāhmaṇa becomes
immortalised.’

*Śruti* (Aparārka, p. 966).—‘When all the desires residing in his heart
become abandoned, then the mortal becomes immortal and even in this
world, attains Brahman.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Do.).—‘The Brāhmaṇa or the Kṣatriya or the Vaiśya shall
go forth from his house as a Renunciate, after he has wiped off the
three debts and has become free from all notions of *I* and *mine*.’
