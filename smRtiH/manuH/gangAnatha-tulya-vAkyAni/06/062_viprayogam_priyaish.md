*Viṣṇu* (96.27-29, 37).—‘He shall reflect upon the destruction of beauty
by old age,—and upon the pain arising from diseases—bodily, mental, or
due to excesses,—and upon that arising from the five naturally inherent
affections; on the union of those whom we hate, and the separation from
those whom we love.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63.64).—(See under 61.)
