*Mahābhārata* (12.244.28; and 278.22).—(Reproduces Manu, the last foot
being read as *pretya cānantyamaśnute*; under 279, 2, the same foot is
read as ‘*tathānantyāya kalpate*.’)

*Baudhāyana* (2.17.29).—‘Finally he pours as much water as fills his
joined hands, saying “I promise not to injure any living being.” They
quote the following:—“A Renunciate who roams about after having given a
promise of safety to all living beings, is not threatened with danger by
any creature.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.1-3).—‘The Renunciate should depart from his house,
giving a promise of safety from injury to all living beings. They quote
the following:—“That Renunciate who wanders about at peace with all
creatures, forsooth, has nothing to fear from any living being; hut he
who becomes a Renunciate and does not promise safety from injury to all
beings, destroys the born and the unborn; and so does a Renunciate who
accepts presents.”’
