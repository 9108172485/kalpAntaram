*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.15-17).—‘As all rivers, great and small, find a resting
place in the ocean, even so men of all orders find protection with
Householders. As all creatures exist through the protection afforded by
their mothers, even so all mendicants subsist through the protection
afforded by Householders.’
