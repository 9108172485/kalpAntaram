*Viṣṇu* (96.7, 8).—‘He should receive food in an earthen vessel, or in a
wooden bowl, or in a vessel made of gourd; he should cleanse these
vessels with water.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.60).—‘The vessels for the Renunciate are those made of
clay, bamboo, wood and gourd; the cleansing of these is by means of
water and scrubbing with cow’s hair.’

*Hārīta* (Aparārka, p. 964).—‘He shall have for his vessels either his
hand only, or those made of clay or wood or bamboo-chips or gourd or
torn leaves; holding these he shall enter the village for alms.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Do., p. 965)—‘The begging-bowl shall he one only, made
of either wood or gourd or bamboo-chips or clay. The cleansing of this
is to he done each time by scrubbing it with a rope made of cow’s hair
and water.’

but never in the leaves of *Vaṭa* or *Aśvattha*, or

bell-metal are declared to be unclean.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 567).—‘Vessels made of gold or iron are not
for Renun dates; the Renunciate should avoid these.’

vessel made of bell-metal, or gold or silver or copper or tin or zinc.’
