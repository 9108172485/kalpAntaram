*Mahābhārata* (12.278.6)—(Reproduces the first half of Manu).—‘When
angry, he should speak gently; when abused, he should speak in an
agreeable manner.’

*Gautama* (3.24).—‘He shall be indifferent towards all creatures, and to
an injury or to a kindness.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.11.23).—‘With the three means of punishment,—word,
thought and action,—he shall not injure created beings.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.29).—‘He shall he utterly indifferent, avoiding injury
and kindness towards living beings.’

*Viṣṇu* (96.19, 29, 23).—‘He must hear abuse patiently;—he must treat no
one with contempt. Should one man chop his one arm with an axe, and
another sprinkle his other arm with sandal, he must neither curse the
one in his mind, nor bless the other.’
