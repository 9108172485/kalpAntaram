**(verse 6.87)**

*Gautama* (3.2-3).—‘The four orders are—Student, Householder, Hermit and
*Vaikhānasa*. The Householder is the source of these, because the others
do not produce offspring.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.1).—‘There are four orders:—Householder, Student,
Hermit and Renunciate.’

*Śukranīti* (4.4.1-5).—‘The Brahmacāri, the Gṛhastha, the Vānaprastha
and the Yati are the four compulsory stages for every Brāhmaṇa. The
Brahmacāri is the disciple who wants learning; the Gṛhastha is for
maintaining all men; the Vānaprastha is for restraining the passions and
activities, and the Sanyāsi attempts the attainment of salvation.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.11-12).—‘The Student, the Householder, the Hermit and
the Renunciate.’

**(verse 6.88)**

*Gautama* (3.1).—‘Some people declare that he who has studied the Veda
may make his choice as to which among the orders he shall enter.’

*Āpastamba* (2.21.2).—‘If he lives in all these four orders according to
the rules, without allowing himself to be disturbed, he will gain
liberation.’
