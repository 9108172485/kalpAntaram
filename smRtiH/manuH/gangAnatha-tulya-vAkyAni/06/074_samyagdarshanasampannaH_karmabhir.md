**(verses 6.74-75)  
**

*Āpastamba* (2.21.14-16).—‘Some say that he obtains liberation if he
knows the Ātman;—but that opinion is opposed to the scriptures; if
liberation were obtained by the knowledge of the Ātman alone, then he
ought not to feel any pain even in this world.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.66).—‘Truthfulness, abstention from stealing and from
anger, modesty, purity, discrimination, steadfastness, self-control,
control over sense-organs and learning have been declared to be
*Universal Dharma*.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.6).—‘Harmlessness is the highest of all virtues,—such is
the unanimous opinion of all living beings. Therefore with feelings of
kindness shall the king protect his people.’
