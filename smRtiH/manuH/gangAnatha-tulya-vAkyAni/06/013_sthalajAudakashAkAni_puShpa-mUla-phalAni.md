by roots, fruits, leaves and grass.’

*Do*. (2.23.2).—‘Afterwards he shall wander about sustaining his life
with roots, fruits, leaves and grass which he collects. Finally, he

mode of subsistence procures greater rewards’

rites prescribed by Śruti and Smṛti, he shall perform with oils
extracted from fruits.’
