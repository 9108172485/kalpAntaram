*Viṣṇu* (96.36, 38).—‘He shall reflect upon the anxieties arising in
youth from not obtaining the objects of pleasure, and upon the abode in
hells awarded as punishment for enjoying them after they have been
obtained unlawfully; and on the fearful agonies of hell.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63, 64).—‘He should reflect upon residence in the womb,
as also the sufferings brought about by one’s own acts, mental agonies,
physical ailments and other troubles, decrepitude, bodily deformities,
birth and rebirth during thousands of lives, and vicissitudes of
pleasure and pain.’
