*Viṣṇu* (96.40-42).—‘He shall reflect thus that there is no pleasure to
bo met within this never-ceasing passage of the soul through mundane
existence; and that even what is called pleasure, on account of the
absence of pain, is of a transient nature; and that he who is unable to
enjoy such pleasures, from sickness and other causes, or who is unable
to procure them, suffers severe pangs.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.63.64).—(See under 61.)
