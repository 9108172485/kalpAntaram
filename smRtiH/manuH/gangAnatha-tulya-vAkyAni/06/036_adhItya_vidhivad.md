**(verses 6.36-37)  
**

*Bodhāyana* (2.11.34).—‘Those dwell with us who fulfil the following
duties—the study of the Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of
offspring, faith, austerity, sacrificing and giving gifts; he who
praises other duties becomes dust and perishes.’

*Āpastamba* (2.24.8).—(Same as Baudhāyana.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.57).—‘One shall turn his mind towards liberation only
after having studied the Vedas, performed *japa*, obtained sons, given
away food, maintained the fires and performed sacrifices to the best of
his ability;—never otherwise.’

(For other texts, see under 33-34.)

*Kāmandaka* (2.29-31).—‘The duties of the Renunciate are to renounce all
activity, to live on begging, to dwell under trees, to refuse all gifts,
to avoid injury to living beings, to maintain an attitude of equality
towards all, to be neutral to friends and enemies, to be unmoved by joy
and grief, to be pure in mind and body, to curb speech, observe vows, to
withdraw the senses from their objects, to keep the mind collected, to
be absorbed in meditation and to purify his intentions.’
