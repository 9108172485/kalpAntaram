*Gautama* (3.36).—‘The venerable teacher prescribes one order only;
because the order of Householders is explicitly prescribed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8.14).—‘A householder alone performs sacrifices; a
householder alone performs austerities; and the order of Householders is
the most distinguished among the four.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.27-29).—‘These three—the Student, the Hermit and the
Renunciate—derive their subsistence from the order of Householders;
therefore must a Householder not treat them with disdain, when they have
arrived. The Householder offers sacrifices, the Householder practises
austerities, the Householder distributes gifts; therefore is the order
of Householders the best of all.’
