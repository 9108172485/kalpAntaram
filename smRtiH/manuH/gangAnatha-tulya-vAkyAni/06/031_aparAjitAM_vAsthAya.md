*Baudhāyana* (3.3.10.11, 12).—‘The hermits called *Unmajjakas* avoid
iron and stone implements; those called *Pravṛttāśins* take food with
the hand; those called *Mukhenādāyins* take it with the mouth only.’

*Āpastamba* (2.23 also 2.22.24).—‘Then he shall live on water, then on
air and finally on *Ākaśa*:—each succeeding method bringing a greater
reward.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.55).—‘Eating air, he shall proceed towards the
North-East till his body perishes.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Aparārka, p. 945).—‘The hermit shall undertake either the
Long Journey, or drown in water or enter the fire, or fall from a
precipice.’
