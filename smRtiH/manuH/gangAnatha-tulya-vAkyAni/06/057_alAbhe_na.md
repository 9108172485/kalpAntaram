*Mahābhārata* (12.278.10).—‘He shall have only as much as would sustain
his life, and should not care for the obtaining of vessels; he should
not be aggrieved when ho fails to obtain things, nor should he exult at
obtaining them.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (10-22).—‘He should not be dejected when he obtains nothing,
nor glad when he receives something. He should seek only as much as will
sustain life, without caring for property.’

*Viṣṇu* (96.4).—‘If he does not get alms, he must not be sorry.’
