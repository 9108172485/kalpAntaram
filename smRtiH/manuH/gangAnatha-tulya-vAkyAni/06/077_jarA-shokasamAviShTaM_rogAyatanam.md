*Mahāhhārata* (12.330.42.43).—(Same as Manu.)

*Maitryupaniṣad* (3.4)—Do.

*Viṣṇu* (96.43-55).—‘He must recognise this human frame to consist of
seven elements;—those elements are adeps, blood, flesh, flesh-serum,
bone, marrow and semen. It is covered with skin; and it has a nasty
smell; it is the receptacle of impure substances. Though surrounded by a
hundred pleasures, it is subject to change; though carefully supported,
it is subject to destruction. It is the stay of carnal desire, wrath,
greed, folly, pride and selfishness. It consists of earth, water, fire,
air and *ākāśa*. It is provided with bone, tubular vessels, arteries and
sinews. It is endowed with the quality of *Rajas*. It is covered with
six skin-layers; it is kept together by three hundred and sixty hones.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.10).—‘This clayey tenement rendered agreeable by
artificial means is evanescent like a shadow and vanishes even as a
bubble of water.’
