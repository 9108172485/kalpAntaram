*Vaśiṣṭha* (10.30).—‘To avoid backbiting, jealousy, pride,
self-consciousness, unbelief, dishonesty, self-praise, blaming others,
deceit, covetousness, delusion, anger, and envy is considered to be the
duty of all orders.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.66).—‘Truthfulness, abstention from unrighteous
appropriation and anger, modesty, purity, discrimination, steadiness,
self-control, control over sense-organs and learning—these have been
declared to be *universal dharma*.’

*Arthaśāstra* (p. 30).—‘To all men—desisting from injuring others,
truthfulness, purity, freedom from jealousy and cruelty and
forgiveness.’

*Kāmandaka* (3.34-36).—‘Not to find no fault with others, to observe his
own duties, to show compassion for the distressed, to address sweet
words to all, to save friends even at the cost of his life, to welcome
enemies coming to the house, to practise charity commensurate with his
resources, to be against sufferings, to conciliate estranged friends, to
treat kindly and obey the wishes of all relations,—these are the
characteristics of the high-minded.’
