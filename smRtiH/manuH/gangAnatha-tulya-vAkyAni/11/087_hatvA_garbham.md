*Gautama* (22.12-13).—‘The same penance that has been prescribed for
Brāhmaṇa-slaying shall be performed by one who has killed a Brāhmaṇa
female when she has bathed after her course; also for destroying the
embryo of a Brāhmaṇa, though its sex may be not distinguishable.’

*Bodhāyam* (2.1-12).—‘The penance for killing a woman who has bathed
after her courses is the same as that for the killing of a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Āpastamba* (1.24.8-9).—‘He who has destroyed an embryo of a Brāhmaṇa,
or a woman during her courses, is called *Abhiśasta*, accursed, and
stands on the same footing regarding expiation, as the Brāhmaṇa-killer.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.23, 34-35).—‘He is called *Bhrūṇahan* who kills a
Brāhmaṇa or destroys an embryo the sex of which is unknown. For killing
a female of the Brāhmaṇa caste who is an *Ātreyī*...... the same penance
that is prescribed for the Brāhmaṇa-killer should be performed. That
woman is called *Ātreyī* who has bathed after her courses.’

*Viṣṇu* (50.8-10).—‘He who has killed a pregnant woman, or a woman in
her courses, or a woman who has bathed after her courses, or a friend,
shall perform the *Mahāvrata*.’ (p. 839)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.251).—‘He who destroys an embryo or an *Ātreyī* woman
should perform the penance laid down for the Brāhmaṇa-killer.’
