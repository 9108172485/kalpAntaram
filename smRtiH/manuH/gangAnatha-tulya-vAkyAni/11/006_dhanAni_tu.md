*Mahābhārata* (12. 165. 5).—(Same as Manu 7.)

*Vaśiṣṭha* (8. 10).—‘He who possesses wealth sufficient for the expenses
of a Soma-sacrifice shall not abstain from offering that sacrifice.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.8-10).—‘He who has sufficient supply of food for three years
shall perform the Soma-sacrifice;—he shall perform the Soma-sacrifice
once a year during the Spring.—If he has less than that, he shall
perform the *Vaiśvānarī* sacrifice.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.124).—‘The twice-born man who has a supply of food
which is more than what he shall need for three years, should perform
the Soma-sacrifice;—and one who has food enough for one year should
perform the rites preliminary to the Soma-sacrifice.’
