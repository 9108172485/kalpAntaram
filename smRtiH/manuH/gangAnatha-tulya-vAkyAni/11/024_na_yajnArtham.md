**(verses 11.24-25)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (59.11).—‘He shall not make an offering of food obtained as alms
from a Śūdra.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.127).—‘If a man performs a sacrifice with accessories
obtained in alms from a Śūdra, he becomes a *Caṇḍāla*.—If one does not
offer away in a sacrifice what he has obtained for that purpose, one
becomes a Bhāsa bird or a crow.’
