*Gautama* (26.6-11).—‘He who desires to be purified quickly, shall stand
during the day and sit during the night; he shall speak the truth; he
shall not converse with any one but Aryans; he shall daily sing the two
*Sāmans*...... He shall bathe in the morning, at noon and in the
evening, reciting three sacred texts... Next, he shall offer libations
of water.’

Do. (27.5-7).—‘He shall offer libations of water and oblations of
clarified butter, consecrate the sacrificial viands and worship the
moon, reciting the verses...... He shall offer clarified butter reciting
the four verses...... And at the end he shall offer pieces of fuel
reciting the verse...’

clothes and speaking the truth, he shall enter the fire-house... Heaping
fuel on the fire... he offers oblations... to Agni... to Agni
Sviṣṭakṛt...... Having drunk water, he offers additional oblations......
gives a cow as the fee and worships the sun.’
