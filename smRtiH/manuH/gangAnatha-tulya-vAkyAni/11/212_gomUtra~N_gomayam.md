*Baudhāyana* (4.5.11).—‘If one lives one day on cow’s urine, one day on
cow-dung, one day on milk, one day on sour milk, one day on clarified
butter, one day on a decoction of *Kuśa* grass, and during one day and
night, on air; that is called the *Sāntapana Kṛcchra*.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.13).—‘Subsisting during one day on each of the following
substances—cow’s urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and decoction
of *Kuśa-* grass,—and fasting on the seventh day—purifies even him who
fears that he has partaken of the food of a *Caṇḍāla*.’

*Parāśara* (10.29).—(Same as Manu.)

*Viṣṇu* (46, 19).—‘Subsisting one day on cow’s urine and cowdung, milk,
sour milk, butter and water in which *Kuśa* grass has been boiled, and
fasting the next day, is called *Sāntapana*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.315).—‘Kuśa-water, cow’s milk, sour milk, urine,
cowdung, and butter,—having eaten these, if one fasts on the following
day, it is *Sāntapana Kṛcchra*.’
