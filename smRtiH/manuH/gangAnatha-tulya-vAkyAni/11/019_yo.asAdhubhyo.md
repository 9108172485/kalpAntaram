**(verses 11.19-22)  
**

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.12).—(Same as Manu).

*Gautama* (18.31-32).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa possesses sacred learning and a
good character, he must be supported by the King,—if the sacred law is
violated and the King does not do his duty, he commits sin.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.43).—‘Of the starving Brāhmaṇa the King shall arrange
for maintenance, after having found out all about his conduct, family,
character, learning, knowledge and austerities,—and also his household.’
