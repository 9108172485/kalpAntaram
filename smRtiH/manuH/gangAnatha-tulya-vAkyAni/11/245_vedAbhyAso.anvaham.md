*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.7).—‘The daily recitation of the Veda and the
performance, according to one’s ability, of the series of Great
Sacrifices quickly destroy guilt, even that of the *Mahāpātakas*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.311).—‘Sins,—even those born of the
*Mahāpātakas*,—touch not one who is devoted to the reciting of the Veda,
who is tolerant and addicted to the performance of the Great
Sacrifices.’
