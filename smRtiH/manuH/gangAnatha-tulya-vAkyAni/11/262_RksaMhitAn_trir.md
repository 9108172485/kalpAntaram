*Baudhāyana* (3.9.5-21).—‘He must begin with the beginning of the Veda
and continuously recite it. He shall recite the *Saṃhitā* of his Veda
twelve times. If he recites the Saṃhitā a thousand times he becomes one
with Brahman.’

*Baudhāyana* (4.5.29).—‘If one recites the whole Ṛgveda, Yayurveda and
Sāmaveda, or thrice recites one of these three Vedas, and fasts,—that is
the most efficient means of purification.’
