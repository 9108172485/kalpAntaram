*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.5).—‘Even a wine-drinker becomes pure, if he recites the
hymn revealed to Kutsa—‘*Apnaḥ*, etc.’ and the hymn revealed to
Vaśiṣṭha—‘*Prati*, etc.,’ the *Māhitra* hymn and the *Śuddavatīs*.’

*Viṣṇu* (55.4).—‘By reciting the *Aghamarṣaṇa* hymn (and taking one meal
of sacrificial food each day, for a month) a wine-drinker becomes freed
from sin.’

oblations of clarified butter, with the *Kūṣmāṇḍa Mantras*,—and reciting
the *Rudra* hymn, standing in water, the wine-drinker and gold-stealer
become purified; and afterwards a milch cow should be given away.’
