**(verses 11.11-14)**

*Mahābhārata* (12.165.6-9).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (18.24-27).—‘In order to defray the expenses of a wedding,—and
when engaged in a rite enjoined by the secred texts, one may take money
from a Śūdra,—or from a man rich in small cattle who neglects his
religious duties, though he does not belong to the Śūdra caste,—or from
the owner of a hundred cows who has not laid the fire;—or from the owner
of a thousand cows who does not drink *Soma*.’
