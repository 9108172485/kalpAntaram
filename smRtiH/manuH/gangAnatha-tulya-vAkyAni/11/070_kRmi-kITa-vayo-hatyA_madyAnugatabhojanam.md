*Baudhāyana* (2.2.15, 16).—‘The following offences make men
impure:—gambling, performing incantations, subsisting on corn-gleaning
while not performing Agnihotra, subsisting on alms after studentship,
living at the teacher’s house longer than four months after finishing
study and teaching a person like the last, making a living by astrology
and so forth.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.12-18).—‘Now follows the enumeration of offences that
make men impure: cohabitation of Ārya women with Śūdras, eating
forbidden flesh, as of a dog, a man, etc., eating human excreta, eating
a Śūdra’s leavings, and the cohabitation of Āryas with *apapātra*
women;—some people declare that these also cause loss of caste.’

*Viṣṇu* (41.1-4).—‘Killing birds, amphibious animals, and aquatic
animals, and worms or insects, eating herbs resembling intoxicants,—such
are the crimes causing defilement.’
