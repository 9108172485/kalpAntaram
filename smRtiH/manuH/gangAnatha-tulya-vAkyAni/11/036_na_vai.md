*Mahābhārata* (12.165.21-22).—(Same as Manu.)

*Gautama* (2.4).—‘One must not employ a child to offer oblations into
the fire or to make *Bali* offerings.'

*Āpastamba* (2.15.17-18).—‘A female shall not offer any oblations into
the fire; nor a child that has not been initiated.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (2-6).—‘Hārīta quotes the following verse—“No religious rite
can be performed by a child before he has been girt with the sacred
girdle; since he is on a level with the Śūdra before he is born in the
Veda.’
