*Āpastamba* (1.25.10).—‘Those who have stolen gold, drunk wine or
violated the *Guru’s* bed, but not those who have slain a Brāhmaṇa,
shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe at the time of the
three libations, passing the day standing and the night sitting. After
the lapse of three years, they throw off their guilt.’

*Viṣṇu* (52.1-3).—‘He who has stolen gold must bring a club to the King,
proclaiming his deed; whether the King kills him with it, or dismisses
him unhurt, he becomes purified. Or in the case he did it unawares, he
shall perform the *Mahāvrata* for twelve years.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.257-258).—‘One who steals Brāhmaṇa’s gold should hand
over a club to the King, proclaiming his deed; whether killed, or let
off, by the King, he becomes pure, if he does not report it to the King,
he shall he purified by performing the penance laid down for the drinker
of wine;—or he must give away to the Brāhmaṇa his own weight in gold.’
