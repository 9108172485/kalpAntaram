**(verses 11.186-187)**

*Gautama* (20.10-14).—‘But if an outcast has been purified by penances,
his kinsmen shall fill a golden vessel with water from a very holy lake
or river, and make him bathe in that water. Then they shall give him
that vessel, and he, after taking it, shall recite the following
text—“Cleansed is the sky, etc.” Let him offer clarified butter reciting
the sacred texts. Let him then present gold or a cow to a Brāhmaṇa, and
also to his teacher.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.36).—(See above, under 182.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.295).—‘When he returns after having performed the
requisite penances, they shall pour a fresh jarful of water; after that
they shall not despise him, and they shall associate with him in all
matters.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (15.17-20).—‘Outcasts who have performed the prescribed
penance may be re-admitted. Those who strike their teacher, mother or
father may be re-admitted in the following manner: Having filled a
golden or an earthen vessel with water from a sacred lake or river, they
pour it over him reciting three sacred texts.’
