*Viṣṇu* (53.5, 6).—‘By intentional intercourse with a *Caṇḍāla* woman,
he becomes her equal in caste; for intercourse unawares with such, he
must perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* twice.’

Do. (53.9).—‘That guilt which a Brāhmaṇa incurs by intercourse with a
*Caṇḍāla* woman for one night he can remove only by subsisting on alms
and constantly repeating the Gāyatrī for three years.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.4.14).—‘They quote the following:—“A Brāhmaṇa who
unintentionally approaches a female of the *Caṇḍāla* caste, eats food
given by a *Caṇḍāla*, or receives presents from him, becomes an outcast.
But if he does it intentionally, he becomes equal to a *Caṇḍāla*.”’

Do. (2.4.13).—‘The rule regarding intercourse with a woman of the
*Caṇḍāla* caste is that the man should perform the penance of
*Atikṛcchra* and *Cāndrāyaṇa*.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.41).—‘The penance for intercourse with a woman of the
*Caṇḍāla* caste is that he shall subsist during a -month on water only
and constantly repeat the *Śuddhavatī* verses;—or he may go to bathe
with the priests at the conclusion of the *Aśvamedha* sacrifice.’
