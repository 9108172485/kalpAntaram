*Gautama* (21.7).—‘Manu declares that the first three crimes
(Brāhmaṇa-killing, wine-drinking and violating of Guru’s bed) cannot be
expiated.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1-6).—‘They quote the following—“He who unintentionally
slays a Brāhmaṇa becomes sinful”... The sages declare that he may be
purified if he did it unintentionally; but no expiation is found for
wilful murder.’
