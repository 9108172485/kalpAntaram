*Gautama* (24.12).—‘Thrice repeating the *Aghamarṣaṇa* hymn, while
immersed in water one is freed from all sins.’

*Baudhāyana* (3.5.1-6).—‘Now we shall describe the rule of the most holy
*Aghamarṣaṇa*:—One goes to a bathing place and bathes there; dressed in
a pure dress, he shall raise, close to the water, an altar, and
moistening his clothes by one application of water, and filling his hand
once with water, he shall recite the *Aghamarṣaṇa* hymn privately. He
shall repeat it one hundred times in the morning, one hundred times at
midday, and one hundred times, or an unlimited number of times in the
afternoon. When the stars have appeared, he shall partake of gruel
prepared of one handful of barley. After seven days and nights of this
course, he is freed from all minor sins, committed intentionally or
unintentionally; after twelve days and nights, from all other sins,
except the *Mahāpātakas*; after twenty-one days he overcomes even these
latter and conquers them.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.8).—‘Plunging into water, he may thrice recite the
*Aghamarṣaṇa*. Manu has declared that the effect of this is the same as
that of joining in the final bath of the *Āśvamedha*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.302).—‘The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa, having fasted for
three days and having recited, in water, the *Agha* *marṣaṇa* hymn, and
giving a milch cow, becomes purified.’
