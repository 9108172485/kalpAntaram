*Gautama* (24.2-3).—‘He who desires to accept, or has accepted a gift
which ought not to he accepted, shall recite the four Ṛk verses
beginning with “*Tarat sa mandī*,” standing in water. He who desires to
eat forbidden food, shall scatter earth on it.’

*Baudhāyana* (4.2.4-5).—‘He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has
accepted gifts, must repeatedly recite the four Ṛk-verses called
*Taratsamandīs*. But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food,
or food given by a person whose food should not be eaten, the means of
removing the guilt is to sprinkle water over one’s head while reciting
the *Taratsamandī* verses.’
