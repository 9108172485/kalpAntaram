*Viṣṇu* (54.1).—‘If a man associates with one guilty of a crime, he must
perform the same penance as that person.’

*Vyāsa* (Aparārka, p. 1088).—‘If a sinful man associates with another
man, the latter shall perform the same penance as the former, but only
three quarters of it.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do., p. 1087).—‘If a man associates with a sinner for six
months, through sacrificing, teaching and the like, or though occupying
the same seat or couch with him, he should perform half of that penance
which has been prescribed for that sinner.’
