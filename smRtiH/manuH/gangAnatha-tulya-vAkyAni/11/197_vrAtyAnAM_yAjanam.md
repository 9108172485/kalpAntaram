**(verses 11.197-198)

*Viṣṇu* (54.25).—‘He who has knowingly offered a sacrifice for an
unworthy person, he who has performed the funeral rites for a stranger,
he who has practised magic rites, and he who has performed sacrifices of
the *Ahīna* class,—all these may rid themselves of their sin by
performing three *Kṛcchra* penances.’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.7).—‘He who has been guilty of conduct unworthy of an
Aryan, of calumniating others, of actions contrary to the rules of
conduct, of eating or drinking forbidden things, of connection with a
woman of the Śūdra caste, of an unnatural crime, of performing magic
rites, shall bathe and sprinkle himself with water, reciting the seven
verses addressed to *Apas*, or those addressed to Varuṇa,......... in
proportion to the frequency with which the crime has been committed.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.289).—‘One who performs sacrifices for an Apostate, one
who performs magic rites for encompassing the death of some person, one
who misuses the Veda, or one who abandons a person who has sought his
protection, should perform three *Kṛcchra* penances and subsist upon
barley for one year.’
