*Vaśiṣṭha* (14. 33).—‘For eating garlic, onions, mushrooms, turnips,
śleṣmātaka, exudations from trees, the red sap flowing from incisions in
trees, food peeked at by crows or carried by dogs, or the leavings of a
Śūdra, an *Atikṛcchra* penance must be performed.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.50, 54, 56).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa eats the leavings of a Śūdra, he
should subsist on milk for seven days. If a Kṣatriya eats the leavings
of a Śūdra, he should subsist on milk for five days. If a Vaiśya eats
the leavings of a Śūdra, he should subsist on milk for three days.’
