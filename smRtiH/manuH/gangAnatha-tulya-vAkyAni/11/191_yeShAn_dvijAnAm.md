*Viṣṇu* (54-26).—‘Those twice-born men by whom the *Gāyatrī* has not
been repeated, nor the other ceremonies performed, as the law directs,
must be made to perform three *Prājāpatya* penances and then initiated
according to custom.’

*Āpastamba* (1.1.28-29).—‘If the proper time for initiation has passed,
he shall observe, for the space of two months, the duties of a Student,
as observed by those who are studying the three Vedas; after that he may
be initiated; and after that he may be instructed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.76-78).—‘A man who has missed the *Sāvitrī* may undergo
the *Uddālaka* penance. Let him subsist, during two months, on
barley-gruel, during one month on milk, during half a month on curds,
during eight days on clarified butter, during six days on alms given
without asking, and during three days on water; and let him fast for one
day and night. Or, he may go to bathe with the priests at the end of an
*Āśvamedha* sacrifice. Or, he may perform the *Vrātya-stoma*.’
