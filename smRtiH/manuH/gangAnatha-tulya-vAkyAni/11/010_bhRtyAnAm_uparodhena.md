**(verses 11.9-10)**

*Śātātapa* (Aparārka, p. 283).—‘The twice-born person who, in feeding
and making gifts, passes over the student near at hand destroys his
family to the seventh generation.’

*Bhaviṣyapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘If one passes over the Brāhmaṇa near at
hand,—except when he is an outcast,—and feeds one at a distance, he
falls into hell.—For this reason, the wise man should never pass over
his neighbours and relations, or his daughter’s son or sister’s husband,
or his sister’s son specially, and other relations; he should not pass
over these even if they be illiterate; passing over them, one falls into
hell.’

*Vyāsa* (Do., p. 282).—‘What is given to one’s parents, brothers,
sisters or daughters, wife or sons,—becomes an irreproachable bridge to
heaven. A gift made to the father becomes a hundredfold, that to the
mother a thousandfold, that to the daughter becomes endless, and what is
given to the uterine brother is imperishable.’

*Dakṣa* (Do., p. 939).—‘The following are the persons that should be
supported by rich persons:—father, mother, teacher, wife, children, a
poor man seeking shelter, guest and fire; also relations that are poor,
an orphan seeking shelter. He shall make presents to learned
men......... The supporting of one’s dependants is the way to heaven,
and the harassing of them is the way to hell.’
