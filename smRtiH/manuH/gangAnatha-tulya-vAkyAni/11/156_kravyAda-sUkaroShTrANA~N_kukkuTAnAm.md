*Gautama* (23.4-5).—‘For eating any part of a carnivorous beast, of a
camel, or of an ass, or of tame cocks, or of tame pigs,—one should
perform the penance of *Taptakṛcchra*.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.30).—‘If he has swallowed the flesh of a dog, a cock, a
village pig, a grey heron, or an owl,—he must fast for seven days and
thus empty his entrails; after that he must eat clarified butter and
undergo Initiation a second time.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.3-4).—‘One must perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance if he has
eaten garlic or onions, or other things having the same flavour, or the
meat of village pigs, of tame cocks, of apes or of cows;—and in all
these cases, the man must undergo Initiation a second time, after the
penance is over.’
