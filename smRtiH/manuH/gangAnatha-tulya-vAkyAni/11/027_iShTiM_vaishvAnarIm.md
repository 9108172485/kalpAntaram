*Mahābhārata* (12.165.15).—(Same as Manu).

*Viṣṇu* (59.10).—‘If he has not wealth sufficient to defray the expenses
of the *Soma* and other sacrifices, he shall perform the *Vaiśvānarī*
sacrifice.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.125-126).—‘The Twice-born man should perform, every
year, the Soma-sacrifice,—the Paśu-sacrifice, at every solstice,—also
the *Āgrāyaṇeṣṭi* and the *Cāturmasya* sacrifices.—If it be impossible
for him to do all this, he should perform the *Vaiśvānarī* sacrifice.’
