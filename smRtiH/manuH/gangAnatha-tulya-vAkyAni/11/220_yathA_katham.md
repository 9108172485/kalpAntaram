*Baudhāyana* (3.8.31).—‘He who studies this becomes the companion of the
lunar constellations, of sun and moon, and dwells in the regions of
these.’

Do. (4.5.20).—‘A Brāhmaṇa who eats anyhow, during a month, thrice-eighty
mouthfuls of sacrificial food, goes to the regions of the Moon.’

*Gautama* (27.16-18).—‘He who has completed the *Cāndrayāṇa*, becomes
free from sin and free from crime, and destroys all guilt. He who has
completed a second month in the same manner, sanctifies himself, his ten
ancestors and ten descendants, as well as any company to which he may be
invited; and he who has lived a year in that manner dwells, after death,
in the regions of the Moon.’

*Viṣṇu* (47.9).—‘Eating anyhow three hundred, *minus* sixty, mouthfuls a
month, is the penance called *Sāmānya* - *Cāndrāyaṇa*.

*Yājñavalkya* (3.324, 326).—‘If, anyhow, one eats two hundred and forty
morsels during one month, this would be another kind of *Cāndrāyaṇa*.
One who performs the *Cāndrāyaṇa* for the sake of spiritual merit (and
not as an expiatory penance), obtains the regions of the Moon.’
