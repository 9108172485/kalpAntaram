*Viṣṇu* (22.82).—‘Distilled from sugar, or from the blossoms of
*Madhūka*, or from flour; these three kinds of wine have to be
discerned; as the one so all; none of them should be tasted by the
twice-born. Further, that distilled from the blossoms of the *Madhūka*,
from molasses, from the *Ṭaṅka* fruit, from the Jujube fruit, from
dates, from the bread-fruit, from honey, *Maireya* wine, and wine made
of the sap of the cocoanut (coconut?) tree; these ten intoxicating
drinks are unclean for the Brāhmaṇa; but the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya
commit no wrong in touching or drinking them.’

*Agastya* (Aparārka, p. 1070).—‘That distilled from the jack-fruit, from
grapes, from *Madhūka* blossoms, from dates, from palm-fruit, from
sugar-cane juice, from honey, the *Maira*, from the cocoanut,—these
eleven kinds of wine are equal; the twelfth is the wine called *Surā*,
which is the worst of all.’
