*Āpastamba* (1.25.10).—‘Those who have committed theft of gold, or drunk
wine, or had connection with a *guru’s* wife,—hut not those who have
slain a Brāhmaṇa,—shall eat, every fourth meal-time, a little food,
bathe at the time of the three libations, passing the day standing and
the night sitting. After the lapse of three years, they throw off their
guilt.’

*Viṣṇu* (52.5).—‘He who steals grains or valuable objects must perform
the *Kṛcchra* for a year.’
