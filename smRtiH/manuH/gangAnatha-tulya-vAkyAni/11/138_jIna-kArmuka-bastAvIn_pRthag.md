*Gautama* (22.26).—‘For killing an unchaste woman, who is Brāhmaṇi only
in name, one should give a leather bag.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.269).—‘For killing an ill-behaved Brāhmaṇi, or
Kṣatriyā, or Vaiśya, or Śūdra woman, one shall give, for purifying
himself, a leather bag, a bow, a goat, or a ram respectively. But for
killing a woman not badly behaved he should perform the same penance as
that for killing a Śūdra.’
