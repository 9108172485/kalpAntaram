*Viṣṇu* (54.32).—‘Let him not however, associate with those who have
killed children, or with ungrateful persons, or with those who have
tilled a woman, or one who came to him for protection,—even though such
sinners may have secured absolution according to the Law.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.299).—‘Those who have killed a person seeking
protection, or a child or a woman, or those who are ungrateful,—with
these one should not associate, even though they may have performed the
requisite penances.’
