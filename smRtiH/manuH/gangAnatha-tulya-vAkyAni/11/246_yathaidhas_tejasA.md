*Vaśiṣṭha* (27.1-2).—‘If a hundred improper acts, and even more, have
been committed, and the knowledge of the Veda is retained, the fire of
the Veda destroys all the guilt of the man, just as fire consumes fuel.
As a fire burning strongly consumes even green trees, even so the fire
of the Veda destroys one’s guilt caused by evil deeds.’
