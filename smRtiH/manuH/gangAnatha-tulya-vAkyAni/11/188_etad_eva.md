*Yājñavalkya* (3.296).—‘This same rule has been declared to be
applicable to women who have become outcasts. They should however be
given a dwelling in the vicinity of the household, and should also
receive clothes, food and protection.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Āparārka, p. 1208).—‘Four kinds of women must be entirely
abandoned: One who has intercourse with her husband’s pupil, one who has
intercourse with her Guru, one who has killed her husband, and one who
has intercourse with a despicable person.’
