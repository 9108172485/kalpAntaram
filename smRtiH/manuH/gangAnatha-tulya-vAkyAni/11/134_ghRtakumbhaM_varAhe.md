*Gautama* (20.24).—‘For killing a boar, a jar of clarified butter.’

*Viṣṇu* (50.36-89).—‘If he has killed a boar, he should give a jar of
clarified butter. If he has killed a partridge, he must give a *Droṇa*
of sesamum. If he has killed a parrot, a calf two years old. If he has
killed a curlew, a calf three years old.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.272, 273, 275).—‘For killing an elephant, he shall give
five *nīla* bulls: for killing a parrot, a calf two years old; for
killing an ass, a goat or a ram, he should give a bullock; and for
killing the purlew, a calf three years old. For killing a swan, a kite,
a monkey, a carnivorous animal, or birds flying in the air or walking on
the ground, or a peacock, he shall give a cow; hut only a heifer, for
killing a non-carnivorous animal. For killing a partridge, he shall give
a *Droṇa* of sesamum.’
