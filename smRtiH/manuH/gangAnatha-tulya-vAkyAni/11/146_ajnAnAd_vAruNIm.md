*Gautama* (23.2).—‘If the Brāhmaṇa has drunk wine unintentionally, he
shall subsist for three days on hot milk, clarified hatter and water;
and inhale hot air. This penance is called *Tapta-Kṛcchra*. After that
he shall undergo a second initiation.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.19).—‘For unintentionally drinking wine one shall
perform the *Kṛcchra* penance for three months and he initiated again.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (20.19).—‘If a Brāhmaṇa intentionally drinks liquor other
than that distilled from rice, or if he unintentionally drinks liquor
extracted from rice, he must perform a *Kṛcchra* and an *Atikṛcchra*,
and after eating clarified butter, he initiated again.’

*Viṣṇu* (51.1-4).—‘A drinker of liquor must abstain from all religions
rites and subsist on grains separated from the husk, for a year. If a
man has knowingly tasted any of the excretions of the body, or of
intoxicating drinks, he should perform the *Cāndrāyaṇa* penance. In all
these cases, the twice-born man shall be initiated a second time, after
the penance is over,’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.255).—‘On drinking the Vāruṇī wine or semen, or urine
or ordure, unwittingly, the three twice-born castes shall undergo
initiation a second time.’
