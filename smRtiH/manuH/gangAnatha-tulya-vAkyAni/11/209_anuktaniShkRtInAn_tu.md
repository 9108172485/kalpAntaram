*Viṣṇu* (54.34).—‘In order to remove those sins for which no particular
mode of expiation has been mentioned, penances must be prescribed which
shall be in accordance with the ability of the offender, and with the
heaviness of the offence.”

*Yājñavalkya* (3.293).—‘In cases wherefore no expiation has been
indicated, the penance should be prescribed after due consideration of
the place, time, age, capability and the nature of the offence.’
