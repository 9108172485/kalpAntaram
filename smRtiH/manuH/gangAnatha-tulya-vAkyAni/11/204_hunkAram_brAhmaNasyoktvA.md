**(verses 11.204-206)**

*Parāśara* (11.49-50).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.292).—‘For addressing one’s elder with such
disrespectful terms as “*Tvam*” and “*Hum*,” for defeating him in a
discussion, or for binding him with a cloth, one should immediately
appease him and fast during the day.’

*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 1185).—‘For addressing unspeakable words to a
Brāhmaṇa, the expiation ordained is that the man should perform the
*Kṛcchrātikṛcchra* penance and appease the insulted person by falling at
his feet; and for tying a cloth round his neck, the expiation prescribed
is that the man shall fast for three days and appease him by falling at
his feet. If one falsely calumniates the Brāhmaṇa, or injures him, he
shall fast for one day, or for three days, or for six days, according to
circumstances.’
