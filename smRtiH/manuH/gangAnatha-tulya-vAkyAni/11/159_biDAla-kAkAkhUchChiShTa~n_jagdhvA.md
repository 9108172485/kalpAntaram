*Vaśiṣṭha* (23.11).—(See above, 158.)

*Viṣṇu* (51.46-47).—‘If any one eats the leavings of the food of a cat,
of a crow, of an ichneumon, or of a rat, he must drink water in which
*Brahma-śūvarcalā* has been boiled. For eating what has been left by a
dog, he must fast for one day and then drink the five bovine products.’
