*Baudhāyana* (4.1.29).—‘Sixteen breath-suspensions, accompanied by the
*Vyāhṛtis* and by the syllable *Om*, repeated daily, purify, after a
month, even the slayer of a learned Brāhmaṇa.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (26.4).—(Same as above.)

*Viṣṇu* (55.2).—‘The killer of Brāhmaṇa is purified, if, having
approached a river, he suspends his breath sixteen times and takes only
one meal of sacrificial food, each day, for a month.’
