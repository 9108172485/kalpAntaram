*Mahābhārata* (12.165.63).—‘If one’s wife has misbehaved, she shall be
kept confined, and made to perform the same penance that has been
prescribed for the man committing adultery.’

*Viṣṇu* (53.8).—‘A woman who has committed adultery once must perform
that penance which has been prescribed for the adulterer.’

*Paribhāṣā* (Aparārka, p. 1124).—‘For women and invalids, the expiatory
penances are only half of what has been prescribed for men.’

*Bṛhaspati* (Do., p. 1124).—‘The woman who commits adultery should
perform that same penance which men perform for the guilt of having
intercourse with women of the same caste...... If the act has been
committed without the woman’s consent, her husband shall keep her
guarded in the house, clad in dirty clothes, sleeping on the ground, and
subsisting on food given to her just enough to keep her alive; and he
should have the expiatory penances of *Kṛcchra* and *Parāka* performed
by her.’

*Uśanas* (Do., p. 1125).—‘If a man’s wife has misbehaved, he should keep
her clad in inferior clothes, with all her authority taken away from
her; and she should he made to perform either the *Cāndrāyaṇa* or the
*Prājāpatya*.’

*Saṃvarta* (Do.).—‘If a woman has been ravished by force, with her heart
burning with shame, she becomes purified by performing the *Prājāpatya*;
there is no other purification for her.’

*Ṛṣyaśṛṇga* (Do.).—‘If a woman has been ravished by force by a man of
her own caste, her expiation shall consist of fasting for three days.’

*Gautama* (Do.)—‘A misbehaved woman shall be kept guarded and receive
mere subsistence.’
