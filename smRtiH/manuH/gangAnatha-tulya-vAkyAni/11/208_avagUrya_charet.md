*Baudhāyana* (2.1.7).—‘He who has raised his hand against a Brāhmaṇa
shall perform a *Kṛcchra* penance; an *Atikṛcchra* penance, if he
strikes him; *Kṛcchra* and *Cāndrāyaṇa*, if blood flows.’

*Viṣṇu* (54.30).—‘For attacking a Brāhmaṇa, the *Kṛcchra* penance should
be performed; for striking him, the *Atikṛcchra*; and for fetching blood
from him, the *Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*.’

*Parāśara* (11.51).—(Same as Manu.)

*Yājñavalkya* (3.293).—‘For raising a stick against a Brāhmaṇa, the
*Kṛcchra* penance; for striking him, the *Atikṛcchra*; for fetching his
blood, the *Kṛcchrātikṛcchra*; for inflicting such hurt as keeps the
blood within the skin, the *Kṛcchra* should be performed.’
