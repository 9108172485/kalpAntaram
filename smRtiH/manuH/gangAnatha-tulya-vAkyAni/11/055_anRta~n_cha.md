*Gautama* (21.10).—‘Giving false evidence, calumnies which will reach
the ears of the king, an untrue accusation against the *Guru*, are equal
to the *Mahāpātakas*.’

Do. (21.1).—See under 54.

*Viṣṇu* (36.1).—‘Killing a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya, engaged in a sacrifice,
or a woman in her courses, or a pregnant woman, or a Brāhmaṇa woman who
has bathed after temporary uncleanliness, or an embryo of an unknown
sex, or one come for protection, are crimes equal to the crime of
Brāhmaṇa-killing.’

Do. (36.2).—‘Giving false evidence, killing a friend, these are equal to
wine-drinking.’

Do. (37.1-5).—‘Setting one’s self up by false statements, making
statements which will reach the ears of the King, regarding a minor
offence committed by some one, unjustly upbraiding a *Guru*, reviling
the Veda, forgetting the studied Vedic texts; these are crimes of the
fourth degree.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.228-29).—‘Insulting one’s *Guru*, reviling the Veda,
killing a friend, forgetting what has been learnt, these are equal to
Brāhmaṇa-killing; eating forbidden food, dishonesty, lying for
aggrandisement, kissing a woman in the courses, are equal to
wine-drinking.’

*Āpastamba* (1.21.8).—See under 54.
