*Gautama* (22-19).—‘For injuring a frog, an ichneumon, a crow, a
chameleon, a musk-rat, a mouse or a dog (the penance is the same as that
for the murder of a Vaiśya).’

*Baudhāyana* (1.19.6).—‘For killing a flamingo, a Bhāsa bird, a peacock,
a Brāhmaṇī duck, a Pracetaka, a crow, an owl, a frog, a musk-rat, a dog,
a Babhru, a common ichneumon, and so forth, the offender shall pay the
same fine as for the killing of a Śūdra.’

*Āpastamba* (1.25.13).—‘If a crow, a chameleon, a pea-cock, a Brāhmaṇī
duck, a swan, the vulture called *Bhāsa*, a frog, an ichneumon, a
musk-rat, or a dog has been killed, then the offender should perform the
same penance as that for killing a Śūdra.’

*Vaṣhiṣṭha* (21.24).—‘Having slain a dog, a cat, an ichneumon, a snake,
a frog, or a rat,—one shall perform the *Kṛcchra* penance of twelve
days’ duration, and also give something to a Brāhmaṇa.’

*Viṣṇu* (50.30-32).—‘If he has intentionally killed a dog, he should
fast for three days. If he has unintentionally killed a mouse, or a cat,
or an ichneumon, or a frog, or a Duṇḍubha snake, or a large serpent—he
must fast for one day, and on the next day give a dish of milk, sesamum
and rice mixed together to a Brāhmaṇa and give him an iron hoe as his
fee: If he has unintentionally killed an iguana, or an owl, or a crow,
or a fish, he must fast for three days.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.271).—‘For killing a cat, an alligator, an ichneumon, a
frog or birds, one should drink milk for three days, or perform a
quarter of the *Kṛcchra* penance.’
