**(verses 11.140-141)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (50.46-47).—‘If he has killed a thousand small animals having
hones,—or an ox-load of boneless animals,—he must perform the same
penance as for killing a Śūdra. But if he has killed animals having
bones, he must also give some trifle to a Brāhmaṇa; if he has killed
boneless animals, he becomes purified by one breath-suspension.’

*Gautama* (22.20-2).—‘For killing one thousand small animals with bones,
also for killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the same penance as for
killing a cow; or he may also give something for the killing of each
animal with bones.’

*Āpastamba* (1.26.2).—‘For killing an ox-load of boneless animals, the
same penance as for killing a Śūdra.

*Vaśiṣṭha* (21-25).—‘Having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal
to the weight of a cow, one should perform the *Kṛcchra* penance of
twelve days’ duration, and also give something.’

*Yājñavalkya* (3.269, 275).—‘For killing a thousand animals with bones,
or a cart-load of boneless animals, one should perform the same penance
as for killing a Śūdra. For killing an animal with bones, he shall give
something; and for killing a boneless animal, he shall perform
breath-suspension.’
