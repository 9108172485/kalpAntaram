*Bṛhaspati* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 337).—‘If one feeds a single Sāmavedin
at the Śrāddha, all the three Vedas, Ṛk, Sāman and Yajuṣ, are present in
him. If, for the sake of his fathers, one secures one who has pondered
over the texts of the Sāman, then he secures the entire earth along with
hills and forests. The Ṛk satisfies the father, the Yajuṣ, the
grandfather, and the Sāman, the great-grandfather;—and the Chandoga is
superior even to that.’

*Śātātapa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 337).—‘If one feeds an Atharvavedin at
the offerings to Gods and Pitṛs, he attains endless and imperishable
results;—says the Śruti.’
