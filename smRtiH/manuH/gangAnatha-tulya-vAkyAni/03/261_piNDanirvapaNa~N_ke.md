*Viṣṇu* (73. 25-26).—‘After the Brāhmaṇas have eaten and become fully
satisfied, he shall sprinkle water with grass on the food, with mantra
‘*Māmekṣeṣṭha*,’—scatter the food near the leavings,—ask the Brāhmaṇas,
*Are you fully satisfied*—and having made them sit facing the north, he
shall offer them water for rinsing the mouth; after that he shall
thoroughly wash the spot where Śrāddha had been offered;—he shall do all
this with kuśa in hand,—going round the Brāhmaṇas facing the east with
the mantra *Yanme rama*, etc., he shall honour them with such gifts as
may be within his power, and address to them the words *Abhiramantu
bhavantaḥ*; on which they should say *Abhiratāḥ smaḥ devāśca
pitaraśca*.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.242).—‘Taking up the food, saying *Vriptāḥ sthaḥ*, he
shall obtain their permission and scatter the food on the ground and
pour water once.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.8.22).—‘Having asked *sampannam* (Is it
completed?), he shall gather all the food that has been used and having
taken out of it just what may be needed for the *Sthālīpāka* and *Piṇḍa*
offerings, the rest he shall hand over.’
