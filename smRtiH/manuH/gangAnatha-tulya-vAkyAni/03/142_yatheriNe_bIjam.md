*Āśvalāyana* (1.50).—‘The good man who constantly offers food into the
mouth of one learned in the Veda, becomes freed from heinous sins and
attains union with Brahman.’

*Āśvalāyana* (14.15).—‘At the Śrāddha one shall invite such Brāhmaṇas as
are fully learned in the Rig Veda; in the absence of these, he may
invite persons learned in other recensions of the Veda.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (3.9-13).—‘The offerings made to Gods and Pitṛs should be
presented to the person learned in the Veda; what is presented to one
who is not learned in the Veda reaches neither the Pitṛs nor the
Gods;—that man who has an illiterate person in his bouse and the learned
man at a distance, should present the offering to the learned man; this
would not be a supersession of the illiterate man; there can be no
wrongful supersession of the Brāhmaṇa who is devoid of the Veda; no one
pours oblations into ashes and neglects the burning fire; those regions
where illiterate persons enjoy what should he enjoyed by the learned are
struck by famine and other dangers.’

*Atri-saṃhitā* (152).—‘What is given to an unqualified recipient
destroys the family up to the seventh generation; neither the Gods nor
the Pitṛs accept such offerings.’

*Bṛhaspati* (59).—‘If an illiterate person accepts the gift of the cow
or gold or clothing or land or sesamum, he becomes burnt like fuel; if a
man has an illiterate person at home and the learned man at a distance,
the present should he made to the learned; the supersession of the
illiterate is not wrong.’
