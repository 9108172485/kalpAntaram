*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.7.4, 22).—‘One shall feed such Brāhmaṇas as
are well versed in the Veda; also one who is studying the Veda, the son
of an expounder of the Veda, and one learned in the Veda; when these eat
at a Śrāddha, they purify the line of feeders.’

*Gautama* (15.9, 10).—‘Vedic scholars, endowed with beauty, age and
character; the first offer should be made to the younger men.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 219).—‘One who is foremost in all the Vedas, one
learned in the Veda, the young man knowing Brahman, one who knows the
meaning of the Veda, the *Jyeṣṭhasāman*, the *Trimadhu* and the
*Trisuparṇaka*.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (83, 19, 21).—‘Specially the Yogins. May such a one bo
born in our family as may feed at the Śrāddha the Brāhmaṇa who is a
Yogin! By that would we be fully satisfied.’

*Mahābhārata* (13. 90. 51).—\[Reproduces the first half of Manu.\]
