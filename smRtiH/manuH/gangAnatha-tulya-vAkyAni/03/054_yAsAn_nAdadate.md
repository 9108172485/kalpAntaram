*Mahābhārata* (Anuśā. 81.1-2; also 13.46.1-2).—‘People learned in
ancient lore quote the words of Prācetasa to the effect that in cases
where the relations do not appropriate anything for themselves, it is
not *selling*, it is only a method of honouring the girls, and as such,
entirely harmless and righteous; the whole of the present received
should he made over to the girl.’
