*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.8).—‘Offerings given to friends and relations
reach neither the gods nor the Pitṛs.’ *Mahābhārata* (Anuśāsana,
90.42-43).—‘If at one’s offerings to gods and Pitṛs, his friends happen
to form the predominant factor, then neither the gods nor the Pitṛs are
satisfied; and he goes not to heaven. If one makes friends at the
Śrāddha, he goes not by the path of the gods; collecting his friends at
Śrāddha, ho falls off from heaven.’
