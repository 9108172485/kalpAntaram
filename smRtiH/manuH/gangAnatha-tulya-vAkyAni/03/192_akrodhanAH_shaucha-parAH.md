*Viṣṇu* (9.14,17, 24).—‘He should offer metallic vessels;—specially
those of silver;—whatever is offered with a vessel—howsoever small—made
of gold or silver or rhinoceros-horn or *Udumbara* wood,—becomes
imperishable.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1. 237).—‘The remnant of the oblations one should
carefully offer into vessels, such as may be available; but specially in
those of silver.’
