*Laghu-Āśvalāyana* (23.70).—‘Having obtained the permission of the

*Āditya-Purāṇa* (Do.).—‘Sisters and relations should be entertained at
Śrāddhas; the poverty-stricken, the meek, one with deficient limbs, one
with redundant fingers, those whose birth has been fruitless, those
disgusted and those struck by disease,—all these deserve to be fed.
Bards and Māgadhas, charioteers, dancers and singers, those who have not
got at the Śrāddha what they desired,—these people destroy all fame;
therefore these also should be fed.’

*Matsyapurāṇa* (Do.).—‘Then, at the end of the Vaiśvadeva-offering,
along with his servants, sons and relations, and accompanied by guests,
he shall eat all that had been offered to the Pitṛs.’
