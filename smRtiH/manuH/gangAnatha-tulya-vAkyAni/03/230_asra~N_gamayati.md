*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1030).—‘If there is some flaw
in cleanliness, Rākṣasas take away all that is sacrificed or offered or
given away or eaten, all *japa*, all austerities and all
learning;—similarly also what is given in anger, or what is eaten in
hurry, the Rākṣasas take away both these;—having invited the Pitṛs, one
shall do nothing that may be improper; therefore one shall perform the
Śrāddha with speech and anger under control;—one shall not be angry with
any one, even though there be cause for it; what pleases the Pitṛs is
the Śrāddha that is free from anger.’
