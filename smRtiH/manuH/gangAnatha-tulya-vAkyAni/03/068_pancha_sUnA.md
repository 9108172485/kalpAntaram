*Viṣṇu* (59.19).—‘Mortar and pestle, Grinding stone, Hearth, Water-jar,
Household Implements;—these are the five slaughter-houses for the
Householder.’

*Hārīta* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 389).—‘We are going to describe the
*Sūnās* or slaughterings—by which is meant *that which destroys living
beings*; these are of five kinds: The first *slaughtering* is done by
people hurriedly entering water, by swimming, splashing, throwing about
of water, catching of impurities, and moving in water; (2) the second
they do by hurriedly walking in darkness or in dim light, or by
trampling (upon insects); (3) the third they do by striking, collecting,
capturing, grinding, tearing and so forth; (4) the fourth they do by
attacking, rubbing, pounding and so forth; (5) the fifth by tiring,
heating, sweating, frying, cooking and so forth. These are the five
*slaughterings*, t he source of sin, which people do day by day.’
