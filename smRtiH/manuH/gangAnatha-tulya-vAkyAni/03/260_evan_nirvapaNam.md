*Yājñavalkya* (1.257).—‘The halls he shall give to the cow, the goat and
the Brāhmaṇa; or he shall throw them into fire or water; so long as the
Brāhmaṇas are there, the remnants of food shall not be removed.’

*Gobhila* (4.3.31-34).—‘The halls he shall throw into water; or into the
kindled fire; or Brāhmaṇas may be fed on them; or they may be given to
cows.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.8.9.).—‘The balls shall be given to birds.’

*Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra* (4.8.9.).—‘The balls shall be deposited after
the Brāhmaṇas have eaten, but before they have washed;—and just when it
may be desired or permitted by them; while according to others, this
should be done after they have washed.’

*Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.19).—‘The balls shall be offered, after they
have eaten, but before that, according to some.’

*Laugākṣi* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 750).—‘At sacrifices which are not
commended, they offer the balls before the feeding; but at those that
are commended, it is done after the feeding.’

*Smṛtyantara* (Do.).—‘As regards the different times that have been laid
down for the offering of the balls, one should follow the practice of
his own rescension.’
