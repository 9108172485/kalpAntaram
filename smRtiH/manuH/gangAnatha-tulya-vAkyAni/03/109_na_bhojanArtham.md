*Baudhāyana* (Parāśaramadhava, p. 357).—‘If one offers food after asking
about country, name, family and learning,—he does not obtain the reward
of that act, and does not go to heaven.’

*Parāśara* (1.405).—‘If one offers food after making enquiries regarding
the name, the family and the learning of the guest, he does not obtain
its reward, nor does he go to heaven.’

*Parāśara* (1.48).—‘One should not ask the guest his *gotra* or Vedic
text, nor the extent of his knowledge of Veda or learning; one should
think of him as the god, since he embodies all the gods.’

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 357).—‘One shall not ask his *gotra* or
Vedic text, or country or family or name or learning—when a Brāhmaṇa
traveller arrives seeking for food.’

*Viṣṇu-purāṇa* (Do.)—‘The householder shall honour the guest as
Hiraṇyagarbha, not asking him about his study, *gotra*, Vedic text or
family.’
