*Gautama*. (5.32.34).—‘To the guest not learned in the Veda, water for
washing the feet, an offering of water and also special kinds of food,
always specially cooked.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (4.12).—‘When a person comes to his house, he should welcome
him, rising from his seat and offering him a seat and a bed, and
receiving him with true and agreeable words, free from jealousy.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.4.13-16).—‘The master and mistress of the
house should not refuse to receive anyone who comes to seek for anything
at the proper time; if they have nothing else to offer, they should
offer a place, water, grass and agreeable words.........To a Brāhmaṇa
not learning or learned in the Veda, he shall only offer seat, water and
food and he shall not rise to receive him.’

*Āpastamba* (6.7-14 ).—‘ Having gone up before him, and having met him,
he shall offer to him a seat...... He shall wash his feet; some people
hold that it is only the Śūdra householder and his wife that are to do
this... He shall offer to him water in an earthen vessel, say some...
But if the guest is one who has completed his study, no water is to be
offered to him......... Having pleased him, he shall satisfy him with
sweetly flavoured food.’ \[So on, there are very full directions.\]

*Viṣṇu* (67.45).—‘In the morning and in the evening, he shall offer to
the guest both seat and water, as also food to the best of his power,
after having received him with honour.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.107).—‘To the guest one should make offerings to the
best of one’s capacity; and in the evening the guest is not to be
deprived of sweet words, place and water.’
