*Viṣṇu* (73.2).—‘On the second day, in the forenoon during the brighter
fortnight,—and in the afternoon during the darker fortnight,—he shall
seat on seats covered with kuśa-grass, the Brāhmaṇas who have bathed and
rinsed their mouths, in the order of their learning.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.226).—‘During the afternoon, having respectfully
welcomed the Brāhmaṇas that have come and have rinsed their mouth, he,
with clean hands, shall seat them on seats.’

*Āśvalāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (4.7.2).—‘The Brāhmaṇas equipped with learning,
character, and excellent conduct, who may have arrived at the same time
and have washed their feet and rinsed their mouths,—these he shall seat,
as if they were his forefathers, with faces turned towards the north.’
