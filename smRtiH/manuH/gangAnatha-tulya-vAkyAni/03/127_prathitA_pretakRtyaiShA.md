*Gautama* (15.1).—‘One shall offer Śrāddha to Pitṛs on the moonless
day.’

*Viṣṇu* (76.1-2).—‘The moonless day, the three Aṣṭakās, the three
Anvaṣṭakās, the full-moon days of the month of Māgha, the thirteenth day
of the darker fortnight following after the full-moon day of the month
of Bhādra;—these are the occasions for obligatory Śrāddha, laid down by
Prajāpati; one not offering Śrāddha on these days falls into hell.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.8.1).—‘Offerings to Pitṛs are praiseworthy and conducive
to longevity, heaven and prosperity.’

*Prajāpati-Smṛti* (21).—‘If one performs Śrāddha on the moonless day,
with the help of Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda, his Pitṛs become
satisfied and reward him with what he desires.’
