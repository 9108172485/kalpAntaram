*Viṣṇu* (67.43).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Baudhāyana* (2.7.16).—‘He who eats alone is entirely sinful; the food
he takes is futile.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 457).—‘He who cooks for himself eats
sin; one should always avoid that futile cooking which is intended only
to please his own palate.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika).—‘One shall not cook for himself,
nor shall he kill animals for himself; one who cooks for the sake of
gods and for the sake of Brāhmaṇas does not become tainted with sin.’

*Jābāla* (Do.)—‘He who eats without bathing, eats dirt; he who eats
without having repeated mantras, eats pus and blood; he who eats without
having offered Homa, eats insects; and he who eats food without offering
it to others, eats poison.’
