*Gautama* (15.9).—‘Vedic scholars, endowed with eloquence, beauty, age
and character.’

*Prajāpati-Smṛti* (70, 71, 74).—‘Those engaged in Vedic rites, calm,
sinless, maintainers of Fire, devoted to their duties, austerities,
conversant with the meaning of the Veda, born in noble families, devoted
to parents, maintaining themselves by means of livelihood recommended
for Brāhmaṇas, teachers knowing Brahman,—such are the Brāhmaṇas that are
helpful in the success of Śrāddhas.

*Smṛtyantara* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 350).—‘If food is offered to a
Brāhmaṇa who is devoid of cleanliness, fallen from his vows, and
ignorant of the Veda, it weeps and says —*what sin have I committed*!’

*Mahābhārata-Āśvamedhika* (Do.).—‘Food should be offered to one who
arrives at the right time and place, suffering from hunger, thirst and
fatigue.’
