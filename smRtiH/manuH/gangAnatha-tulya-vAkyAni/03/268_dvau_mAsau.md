*Viṣṇu* (73.27-30).—‘Pronouncing the name and the gotra, he shall offer
the *imperishable water*; then he shall address the words—*Viśvedevāḥ
priyantam*—to those facing the east; and then with joined hands and mind
calm and concentrated on them, he shall beg for the following
blessings—(Manu, 259 and the following) May we have much food! May we
have guests! May there be persons to beg from us! May we not beg of any
one!.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.246).—\[Reproduces Manu 259.\]
