*Vaśiṣṭha* (6.24-25).—‘Some recipients excel in the Veda, some in
austerities; the best of recipients is one who never has had in his
stomach any food given by a Śūdra. That man is called a *Recipient* who
is given to Vedic studies, born of a noble family, quiet, devoted to
sacrificial performances, afraid of sin, fully learned, respectful
towards women, virtuous, protector of the cow, and tolerant through
austerities.’

sacrifices; purified by austerities; purified by truth; purified by
mantras.’

the performance of their duties, devoted to austerities, and devoted to
parents,—such Brāhmaṇas are con ducive to the success of the Śrāddha.’
