**(verses 3.236-237)  
**

*Viṣṇu* (71.19).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.29).—\[Do.\]

But in both the reading is ‘*uṣṇam*’ for ‘*uṣmā*.’

*Śāṅkha* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 749).—‘If he describes the excellences of
the food...he destroys the Śrāddha and becomes degraded.’

*Śāṅkha-Likhita* (Aparārka, p. 497).—‘The Brāhmaṇas shall not describe,
praise or decry the food. They should say nothing except by the gesture
of the hand. The Pitṛs partake of the food only so long as it is on the
ground, until it is praised, and so long as it is hot, except in the
case of fruits, roots and drinks.’
