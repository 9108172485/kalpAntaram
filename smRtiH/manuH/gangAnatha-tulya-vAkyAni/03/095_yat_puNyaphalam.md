*Viṣṇu* (59.15).—‘One acquires the merit of giving away the cow, if he
gives food to one who is seeking for alms.’

*Viṣṇu* (67.28, 32, 44, 46).—‘By honouring the guest, one obtains the
highest reward: by worshipping him, he attains heaven; neither by Vedic
Study, nor by Agnihotra, nor by sacrifices and Purāṇas does the
Householder attain those regions which he attains by the honouring of
the guest; shelter, bed, oiling of the feet and light, by giving to the
guest each one of these, one obtains the same reward that one does by
giving a cow.’
