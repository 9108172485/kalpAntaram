*Baudhāyana* (1.5.84).—‘Through cows, houses and conveyances, through
agriculture and through serving the king, families cease to be families;
as also those that are devoid of the Veda; those families on the other
hand that are rich in the Veda,—even though possessed of little wealth,
come to be numbered among families and acquire great fame.’
