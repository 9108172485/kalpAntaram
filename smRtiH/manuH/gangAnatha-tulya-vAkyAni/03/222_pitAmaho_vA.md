*Āśvalāyana Gṛhyasūtra* (4.8.5-6).—‘If permitted, then, it may be
offered into the hands; Agni being the mouth of the Gods and the hand
being the mouth of the Pitṛs,—so says the Brāhmaṇa-text.’

*Jātūkarṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 739).—‘In the absence of the fire, it
should be offered into the right hand of the Brāhmaṇa. That is regarded
as the period of *absence of fire* while one has not taken to a wife,’

*Gṛhyakāra* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 739).—‘The *Anvaṣṭakā*, the monthly
*Pārvaṇa*, the Śrāddha for obtaining specific reward, the auspicious
Iṣṭi, and the unitary Śrāddha; at the first four of these, the man with
the fire shall offer oblations into the fire; and at the latter four, in
the hands of the Brāhmaṇas invited for the sake of the Pitṛs.’
