*Yama* (Aparārka, p. 449).—‘He in whose family there has been a
cessation of the Veda and the sacrificial altar for three generations is
a had Brāhmaṇa.’

*Vyāsa*.—‘As many morsels the man ignorant of the Veda swallows out of
the offerings made by a man so many darts does he swallow in the abode
of Death.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (Aparārka, p. 449).—‘Those countries where what should be
eaten by the learned is eaten by the illiterate are beset by drought and
great dangers beset them.’

*Hārīta* (Do.).—‘Even those born of noble families and endowed with
learning,—if they be of base conduct and addicted to wicked deeds,—they
are even regarded as demons. Those addicted to the killing of birds,
fish and deer, serpents and tortoise and other animals are all *Bad
Brāhmaṇas*. Who serves a Śūdra, who is supported by the King, the
village-sacrificer, those living by killing and capturing—these six are
*Low Brāhmaṇas*.’
