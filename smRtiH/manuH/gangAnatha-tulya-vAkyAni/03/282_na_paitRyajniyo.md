*Viṣṇudharmottara* (Caturvargacintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 2330).—‘One who has
taken to the fire shall make the offerings into the Dakṣiṇāgni; one who
is without the fire shall do it either in the Upasada fire, or, in the
absence of fire, into the hands of a Brāhmaṇa, or in water.’

*Vāyupurāṇa* (Do.).—‘Having kindled either the Dakṣināgni, for purposes
of Homa, or having kindled the ordinary fire simply for the purpose of
having a fire, he shall offer the oblations for the accomplishment of
the rite.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.97).—‘Every day the householder shall perform the
Smārta rites in the marriage-fire, or in the fire kindled at the time of
inheritance; and the Śrauta rites in the sacrificial fire.’

Do. (1(?).236).—‘When going to pour the oblation into the fire, he shall
take up the food overflowing with butter, and being permitted to go on
with the offering, shall pour the oblation into the fire, in the manner
of the Pitṛyajña.’
