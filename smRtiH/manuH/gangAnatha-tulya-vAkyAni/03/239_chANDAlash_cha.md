*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1029).—‘He shall not
shed tears at the Śrāddha; nor shall he utter words of grief; he shall
not hear ill-will towards those eating nor be jealous of them.’

*Devala* (Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 1029).—‘At the Śrāddha,
people should not shed tears, nor converse, nor laugh among themselves,
nor wander about, nor be angry, nor be worried; even though there be
sufficient cause, one shall not utter words of anger; near the Pitṛs one
shall not sit either supported or perspiring.’
