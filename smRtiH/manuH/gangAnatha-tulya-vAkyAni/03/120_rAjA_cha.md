**(verses 3.110-112)  
**

*Gautama* (5.43).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa can be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa
only if the former is *one who has been engaged in a sacrifice*.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 452).—‘The non-Brāhmaṇa
cannot be the guest of the Brāhmaṇa; the full honours of the guest are
to be rendered only to the Vedic scholar possessed of special
qualifications; the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya are to be received as
friends; and to the Śūdra something may he offered only by way of
favour, to save him from discomfort.’

*Viṣṇu* (67.36).—\[Reproduces Manu, 111 and 112.\]

*Gautama* (5.44-45).—‘To the Kṣatriya food is to be offered after
Brāhmaṇas; others are to be fed along with servants, as a favour.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.4.18).—‘The Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya (are to
be fed); if a Śūdra happen to arrive, he should be directed to do some
work, and food should be given to him.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.3.11-13).—‘Morning and evening, whatever food there may
be, out of that he shall make the Vaiśvadeva offerings, and then
entertain, to the best of his power, the Brāhmaṇa, the Kṣatriya, the
Vaiśya and the Śūdra that may happen to arrive; but when the Śūdra
arrives, he should be directed to do some work.’
