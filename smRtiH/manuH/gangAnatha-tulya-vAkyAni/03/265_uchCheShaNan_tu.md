*Prajāpati* (70.71).—‘The following Brāhmaṇas are conducive to the
accomplishment of the Śrāddha:—Those that are devoted to the Vedic
duties, those that are of calm disposition, sinless, devoted to the
fires, firm in their duties, firm in their austerities, conversant with
the meaning of the Veda, born of noble families, devoted to their
parents, living by the methods prescribed for Brāhmaṇas, teachers, those
conversant with Brahman.’
