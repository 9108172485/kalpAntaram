*Yājñavalkya* (1.\`257).—‘So long as the Brāhmaṇas are there, the
leavings shall not he washed.’

*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.18-20).—‘Till the end of ṭhe day, the leavings of the
Śrāddha shall not be removed; as from those flow currents of nectar
which are drunk by those to whom no water-offerings have been made.—So
long as the sun has not set, the leavings shall not be washed.—Manu has
declared that the leavings and the remnants form the share of those who
have died before the performance of their sacramental rites.’
