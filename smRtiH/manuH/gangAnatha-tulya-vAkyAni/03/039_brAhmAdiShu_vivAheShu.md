*Viṣṇu* (24.34-37).—‘He who gives his girl in marriage by the Brāhma
form goes to the regions of Brahman; by the Daiva, to Heaven; by the
Ārṣa, to the regions of Viṣṇu; by the Prājāpatya, to the regions of the
gods; and by the *Gāndharva* form, one goes to the region of the
Gandharvas.’

*Baudhāyana* (1.11.17).—‘It is well known that as the marriage-forms, so
the offspring.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (2.12.4).—‘To the extent that the form of
marriage is the right one, to that same extent is the offspring born
thereof of the right kind.’

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 865).—\[Reproduces the words of
Manu.\]

*Dakṣa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 866).—‘The reward accruing from the
marrying of a girl by the right form is double in the case of her being
given to a Brāhmaṇa; a hundred-thousandfold in that of her being given
to a learned Brāhmaṇa; and endless in that of her being given to a
thoroughly learned Brāhmaṇa.’
