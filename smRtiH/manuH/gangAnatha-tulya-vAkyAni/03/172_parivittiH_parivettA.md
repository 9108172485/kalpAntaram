*Gobhila-Smṛti* (1.71).—‘The Superseder and the Superseded both
assuredly go to hell; if they have performed the expiatory rite, even so
they participate in the effects reduced only by a quarter.’

*Baudhāyana* (2.1.39).—\[Same as Manu, except that for ‘*Yāyā ca
parividyate*’ the reading is *Yā chainam parivindati*.’

*Mahābhārata* (12.165-68).—(The first line is the same as Manu.)—‘He who
marries illegally—all these are outcasts.’
