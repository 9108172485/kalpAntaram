*Jātūkarṇa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 445).—‘When the father has become one
of the Pitṛs, his son shall, year after year, and month after month,
offer to him Śrāddha in the manner of the *Pārvaṇa* Śrāddhas.’

*Jamadagni* (Do.).—‘When the father or the mother has become amalgamated
with the Piṭṛs, the body-born son shall offer to the parents, on the day
of their death, in the manner of the Śrāddha performed on the moonless
day.’
