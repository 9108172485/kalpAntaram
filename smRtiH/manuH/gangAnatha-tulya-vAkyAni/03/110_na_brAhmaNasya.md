*Viṣṇu* (67.33).—‘If a guest goes away disappointed from the home of any
person, he leaves behind him all his sins and takes away all the merit
of that householder.’

*Parāśara* (1.45.46).—‘If a guest goes away from one’s house
disappointed, his Pitṛs do not partake of anything in that house for
fifteen years. If one disappoints a guest, one’s libations are futile,
even though made with a thousand loads of fuel and a hundred jars of
butter.’

*Mahābhārata-Āśvamedhika* (Parsāharamādhava, p. 355).—‘One may study,
day after day, the Vedas and the subsidiaries, if he honours not his
guest, all study becomes futile. He who honours not the guest arrived
after the Viśvadeva offering, immediately becomes a Caṇḍāla. If a man
turns out a guest from his house, arrived at the right time and place,
he becomes an outcast at that very moment.’
