*Matsya-Purāṇa* (quoted in *Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-*Śrāddha, p.
24-76).—‘Having taken, in due order, portions out of the balls, the man
shall, with due care, have them eaten by those same Brāhmaṇas. Having at
first placed in their hands the pavitra-kuśa along with water and
sesamum, he shall offer the portions of the balls, saying
*svadhaiṣāmastu*.’
