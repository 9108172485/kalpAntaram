*Baudhāyana* (2.6.35).—‘When he is horn, the Brāhmaṇa is beset with
three debts; he repays that to the sages, by means of religious
studentship, that to the gods, by means of sacrifice, that to the Pitṛs,
by means of offspring. There are innumerable debt-contracts; the three
Vedas, religious studentship, begetting of children, śrāddha, austerity,
and sacrifices,—one who performs all this, from him passes off all
impurity.’

*Viṣṇu* (59.29).—\[Reproduces Manu.\]
