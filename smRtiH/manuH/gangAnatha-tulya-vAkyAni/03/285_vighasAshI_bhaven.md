*Mahābhārata* (12.249.12-13) \[reproducing the first line of
Manu\].—‘The remnant of sacrifices is *amṛta*; and the eating of this is
equal to the eating of sacrificial food. He who eats the food left over
after the servants have eaten, is called the *vighasāśī*; *vighasa*
being the food left by servants, and *amṛta*, the remnant of
sacrifices.’ *Mahābhārata* (3.2.60).—\[Reproduces Manu\].
