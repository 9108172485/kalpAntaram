*Baudhāyana* (2.62-65).—‘The gods desirous of purity do not accept the
offerings of the faithless. The gods discussed the relative merits of
the person who is pure but faithless and he who is not pure but full of
faith, and came to the conclusion that both were equal; hut Prajāpati
said to them: “They are not equal; there is great difference; as the
Śrāddha offered by the faithless is damned; what is sanctified by faith
is distinctly superior.” In this connection, they have the following
saying—Want of faith is a great sin; faith is the highest austerity;
therefore, what is offered without faith, the gods never accept.’

*Mahābhārata* (13.188.72, 79).—‘Those men who offer Śrāddhas with due
faith save their forefathers from the most terrible hell; he who
performs the Śrāddha with faith becomes freed from the debt owing to the
Pitṛs.’
