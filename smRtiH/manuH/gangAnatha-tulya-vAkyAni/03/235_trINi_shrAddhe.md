*Vaśiṣṭha* (11.22).—‘One shall offer food to the Pitṛs, with both hands;
wicked-minded Asuras keep in waiting for the interval between the two
hands.’

*Maṭysapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p. 2370).—‘He
shall bring up the food, with both hands, then serve it, with a calm
mind, keeping in his hand water and kuśa.’

*Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa* (quoted in Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi-Śrāddha, p.
2370).—‘Serving shall not be done at the Śrāddha with any article made
of iron, nor by one who is without the Pavitra and the kuśa, nor with
one hand.’
