*Bṛhad-Yama* (3.40-42).—‘The excellent Brāhmaṇa, free from jealousy, of
pure character, learned in the Veda, knowing Brahman, youthful, endowed
with learning and humility,—is the proper recipient; one who is learned
in Vedanta, superior in Sāman, free from avarice, devoted to the Veda,
should be employed in rites sacred to Pitṛs and Gods; whatever is
offered to such a one is imperishable without doubt.’
