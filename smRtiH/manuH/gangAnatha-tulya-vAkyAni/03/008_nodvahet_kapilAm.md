marry a girl who hears signs of a beard, who has a masculine appearance,
whose voice is cracked, who speaks insinuatingly, whose voice is like
the crow’s, who looks on without, winking, whose eyes arc defective;—he
shall not marry her whose thighs arc hairy, whose ankles are high, in
whose, cheeks there are dimples;—he shall, not marry a girl whose skin
is rough, who is pale, who is diseased, or with red eyes, or with lean
hands and feet,—or one who is dwarfish, or too tall, or one whose
eye-brows arc joined: nor one whose teeth have many holes, nor one with
a frightful face.’

*Āpastamba* (Vīramitrodaya-Sarṃskāra, p. 532).—‘One named after an

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Satṃskāra)—‘In selecting a wife one should avoid
one named after a Veda, or a river, or a mountain or a Gandharva, or an
asterism, or a tree, or a creeper.’
