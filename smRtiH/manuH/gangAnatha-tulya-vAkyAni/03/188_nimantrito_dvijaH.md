*Gautama* (15.23).—‘Therefore on that day, he shall live like a
religious student,’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.225).—‘They shall remain under self-restraint, with
mind, speech and acts duly controlled.’

*Prajāpati* (93).—‘The Brāhmaṇa invited at the Śrāddha should avoid
association with women on the previous day and on the next day; as also
the second meal.’

*Likhita* (60).—‘One who has eaten at the Śrāddha shall avoid eight
things: the second meal, journeying, carrying loads, study, sexual
intercourse, making and receiving gifts, and offering of oblations into
fire.’

*Devala* (Aparārka, p. 457).—‘Having been previously invited, if the
Brāhmaṇa accept a gift, or if he eat at the Śrāddha after having taken
his food, then all his merit becomes destroyed.’
