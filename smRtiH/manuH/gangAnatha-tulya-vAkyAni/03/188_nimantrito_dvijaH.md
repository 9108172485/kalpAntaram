*Viṣṇu* (82.14).—‘Those who sacrifice for the Śūdra (should be
avoided).’

*Bṛhad-Yama-Smṛti* (35, 37, 38).—‘The ill-visaged, the eunuch, the
heretic, the decrier of the Veda, the sophist, the sacrificer for the
Śūdra, and those who sacrifice for improper persons,—these should be
avoided with great care at the Śrāddha.’
