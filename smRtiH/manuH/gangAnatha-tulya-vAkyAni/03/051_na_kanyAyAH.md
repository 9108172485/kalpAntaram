*Baudhāyana* (1.11.21).—‘Those persons who, deluded by greed, give away
their daughters for a consideration, are soul-sellers, sinful and grave
sinners, and up to their seventh generation, they fall into hell.’

*Āpastamba Dharmasūtra* (2.13.11).—‘In connection with marriage, a gift
to the girl’s guardian has been prescribed with a view to securing a
special end, and for a righteous purpose; therefore one should present
to the girl’s guardian a chariot and a hundred cows; which present joins
the couple in wedlock; the applying of the name *selling* to such giving
of the girl is a mere declamation; because the acceptance of the present
is for a righteous purpose.’
